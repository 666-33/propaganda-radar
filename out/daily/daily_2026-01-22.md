Ex-intelligence officer in Austria's biggest spy trial for years Former intelligence official Egisto Ott goes on trial in Vienna on Thursday, accused of spying for Russia in what is being dubbed Austria's biggest spy trial in years. Egisto Ott, 63, is charged with having handed over information to Russian intelligence officers and to Jan Marsalek, the fugitive executive of collapsed German payments firm Wirecard. Ott denies the charges. Jan Marsalek, who is also an Austrian citizen, is wanted by German police for alleged fraud and is currently believed to be in Moscow, having fled via Austria in 2020. The subject of an Interpol Red Notice, he is alleged to be an intelligence asset for the FSB, Russia's secretive security service. The spy scandal has revived fears that Austria remains a hotbed of Russian espionage activity and observers will also be watching closely for details that could emerge about Marsalek. Prosecutors in Vienna say Egisto Ott "abused his authority" as an Austrian intelligence official by collecting large amounts of personal data, such as locations, vehicle registration numbers, or travel movements. They say he did this between 2015 and 2020 without authorisation, often using national and international police databases. Prosecutors also charge him with supporting "a secret intelligence service of the Russian Federation to the detriment of the Republic of Austria" by collecting secret facts and a large amount of personal data from police databases between 2017 and 2021. They say Egisto Ott gave this information to Jan Marsalek and unknown representatives of the Russian intelligence service, and received payment in return. In 2022, prosecutors say, Jan Marsalek commissioned him to obtain a laptop containing secret electronic security hardware used by EU states for secure electronic communication. The laptop, they say, was handed over to the Russian intelligence service. He is also suspected, reports say, of having passed phone data from senior Austrian interior ministry officials to Russia. Austria's Standard newspaper says Egisto Ott apparently obtained the work phones after they accidentally fell into the River Danube on an interior ministry boating trip. He is alleged to have copied their contents and passed them on to Jan Marsalek, and Moscow. Egisto Ott is charged with abuse of authority and corruption and espionage against Austria and faces up to five years in prison, if he is found guilty. When he was arrested in 2024, Austria's then Chancellor, Karl Nehammer, described the case as "a threat to democracy and our country's national security". In a separate development, prosecutors in the Austrian town of Wiener Neustadt have told the BBC that a former MP, Thomas Schellenbacher, has been charged with helping Marsalek to escape following the collapse of the Wirecard company in 2020, when it emerged that €1.9bn was missing from its accounts. Schellenbacher is alleged to have helped Jan Marsalek fly to Belarus, from Bad Vöslau in Austria, in June 2020. Schellenbacher was an MP for the far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ), which has been accused by Austria's Green Party, now in opposition, of enabling Russian espionage, of acting as "an extension of Russia's arm" in Austria. The FPÖ and its leader Herbert Kickl have denied the allegations - and have not faced any legal action in connection with any of them. Marsalek, who was the Wirecard's Chief Operating Officer, has since been charged with fraud and embezzlement, suspected of having inflated company's balance sheet total and sales volume. He is also believed to have been the controller of a group of Bulgarians who were convicted in London in 2025, of spying for Russia. Messages from that trial reveal Marsalek has had plastic surgery to alter his appearance as well as details of his life as a fugitive. "I'm off to bed. Had another cosmetic surgery, trying to look differently, and I am dead tired and my head hurts," he wrote to one of the Bulgarians, Roussev, on Telegram in February 2022. In another, dated 11 May 2021, Roussev congratulated Marsalek for learning Russian. "Well I am trying to improve my skills on a few fronts. Languages is one of them," the Austrian responded. "In my new role as an international fugitive I must outperform James Bond."

**Excerpt**

Faisal Islam: What it was like inside the room with Donald Trump at Davos I was in the room when President Donald Trump entered and it's fair to say he got a good welcome from the crowd, certainly at the beginning. A standing ovation. On top of that, there was an astonishing scrum to try to get in, with many turned away - even heads of state. The security was unbelievable, not letting even some of the most famous attendees in or out of the hall. Minutes into the speech, Trump was keeping his cool - even dropping in phrases about wanting the UK "to do great". What some thought would be the day on which the US president laid down the laws of his new global economy was filled more with grandfatherly advice. It was far from the mildly menacing tone of his social media posts claiming that Greenland will be America's. But which one is the real Donald Trump? Has he heard how badly some of his rhetoric has gone down? As I entered, I was told of an astonishing event last night where Trump's Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told the audience that, in terms of Europe's economy, "you're dead". There was a walkout. Might there have been one today? He seemed to be trying to avoid that. The Speech goes rather dark At first, I thought Trump was trying on a diplomatic front, perhaps having heard some of the significant criticism levelled against him and trying to sound mellow. He talked in friendly terms about the western allies that had been most perturbed by his social media posts. He even acknowledged that he probably shouldn't speak about the controversial issue of Greenland - which he has repeatedly vowed to take over. But, almost as though he could not help it, the speech seemed to take a dark turn. First he described America's role helping Greenland in the past, including being friendly to Denmark. But he then insulted Europe's biggest economy, saying everyone in the hall "would be speaking German" if it wasn't for the US. And then it came. He announced he was seeking immediate negotiations for the USA to acquire Greenland. A negotiated settlement, he said. No force required. But the US needed "full title". "We want this land" to build the "greatest Golden Dome ever built", he said. And he warned Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney about his words a day earlier, though stressing that he would also use Greenland to defend Canada. "I'm asking for a piece of ice... it's a very small ask." It was incredible to see this said out loud. Mixed reactions in the room There was high security, high stakes and high tension in the Alps for the arrival of the would-be sheriff of the world, brandishing his new rules. The reaction in the room ranged. The president's attempts at charm seemed to win him polite applause. But as he went from rigged elections to his annoyance at other leaders' Davos speeches, some sat in disbelief. Even though he promised not to invade Greenland, many were stunned by his attempts to persuade Europe to hand over the territory. Gavin Newsom, the Democratic governor of California said the speech was "TACO" Tuesday, a reference to the "Trump always chickens out" catchphrase used to mock the president. He argued Trump had backed down after robust pushback from leaders Emmanuel Macron and Mark Carney. A key Republican senator, Thomas Tillis, said the president's pursuit of Greenland, even a negotiated annexation, would not have the backing of Congress. So while Trump attempted to dial down tensions, he still criticised allies - including personal attacks on leaders. And while he promised not to invade Greenland, he still said it will be part of the new America - and that the world should thank him for it. The speech may have eventually come to an end, but we will be talking about it for a long time to come.
