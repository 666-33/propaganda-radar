'It's all about the land': Zelensky says Ukraine to talk to US and Russia President Volodymyr Zelensky says trilateral talks on ending the war in Ukraine are to take place with Russia and the US in the United Arab Emirates, after he met President Donald Trump in Davos. As the diplomatic pace appeared to intensify, Trump said his meeting with Zelensky was good, and US envoy Steve Witkoff headed to Moscow for talks with Russia's Vladimir Putin. Witkoff, who was travelling to Moscow with Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, said he was optimistic about a deal. "I think we've got it down to one issue and we have discussed iterations of that issue, and that means it's solvable," he said before leaving the Swiss resort. Trump's envoy gave no details about the remaining sticking point, but Zelensky later clarified that the future status of eastern Ukraine remained the unsolved issue. He made clear that the planned talks in the Emirates would involve Russia as well as the US and Ukraine, adding that "the Russians have to be ready for compromises, not only Ukraine". "It's all about the land. This is the issue which is not solved yet," Zelensky told reporters at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland - adding that trilateral talks might provide the two sides with "variants". The US proposal for Ukraine's industrial heartland in Donbas is for a demilitarised and free economic zone in exchange for security guarantees for Kyiv. "If both sides want to solve this, we're going to get it solved," Witkoff said, explaining that he would be heading to Abu Dhabi after Moscow, where working groups would be covering military issues as well as economic prosperity. Zelensky also told reporters that he had reached an agreement with Trump on future US security guarantees for Ukraine in the event of a deal. He gave no details but said it would need to go before the US Congress and Ukrainian parliament before signing. Although he said the "Coalition of the Willing", led by the UK and France, had committed forces on the ground to monitor the deal, he was adamant a Trump backstop would be necessary too: "No security guarantees work without the US." Earlier he used his Davos speech to criticise his European allies for a lack of "political will" to take action against Russia. "There are endless internal arguments and things left unsaid that stop Europe from uniting and speaking honestly enough to find real solutions," he said, drawing a contrast with the US under Trump. "President Trump loves who he is, and he says he loves Europe, but he will not listen to this kind of Europe," he said. The Ukrainian president had travelled through the night to get to Davos. He had initially called off his trip to deal with the aftermath of Russian strikes on Kyiv's power infrastructure, which have left large areas of the capital without heating, water or power during the harshest winter so far in almost four years of Russia's full-scale war. Thousands of apartment blocks remain without heating. Zelensky said last month that a 20-point US plan to end the war was 90% ready and that Ukraine's position on Donbas, in eastern Ukraine, was different to Russia's. As part of the US 20-point plan, Zelensky has offered to withdraw troops by up to 40km (25 miles) from the 25% of the Donetsk region that Ukraine still controls in order to create an economic zone in Donbas, if Russia does the same. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday that discussions with the American envoys would continue "on the Ukrainian issue and other related topics" and refused to say whether he shared Witkoff's optimism on achieving a deal. Putin is known to covet control of the entire region, and Russian forces have advanced slowly in the east in the past year. Another big sticking point that Zelensky highlighted last month was future control of Ukraine's enormous Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, seized by Russia in March 2022. Zelensky joked that he hoped the Emirates knew about the planned meeting, but in a measure of the seriousness of the talks he named some his most senior officials in the Ukrainian team taking part. The head of the country's national security and defence council, Rustem Umerov, was already talking to US officials in Davos, along with Kyrylo Budanov, the head of Zelensky's office, and negotiator David Arakhamia. They will be joined the chief of the general staff, Andrii Hnatov.

**Excerpt**

US unveils plans for 'New Gaza' with skyscrapers The US has unveiled its plans for a "New Gaza" that would see the devastated Palestinian territory rebuilt from scratch. Slides showed dozens of skyscrapers stretching along the Mediterranean coast and housing estates in the Rafah area, while a map outlining the phased development of new residential, agricultural and industrial areas for the 2.1 million population. They were presented during a signing ceremony at the World Economic Forum in Davos for President Donald Trump's new Board of Peace, which is tasked with ending the two-year war between Israel and Hamas and overseeing reconstruction. "We're going to be very successful in Gaza. It's going to be a great thing to watch," Trump declared. "I'm a real estate person at heart and it's all about location. And I said: 'Look at this location on the sea. Look at this beautiful piece of property. What it could be for so many people.'" Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, who helped broker the ceasefire that took effect in October, said 90,000 tonnes of munitions had been dropped on Gaza and there were 60 million tonnes of rubble to clear. "In the beginning, we were toying with the idea of saying: 'Let's build a free zone, and then we have a Hamas zone.' And then we said: 'You know what, let's just plan for catastrophic success'," he told the ceremony. "Hamas signed a deal to demilitarise, that is what we are going to enforce. People ask us what our plan B is. We do not have a plan B." A map of the US "Master Plan" showed a zone reserved for "coastal tourism", where there would be 180 tower-blocks as well a number of zones for "residential areas", "industrial complex, data centres, advanced manufacturing" and "parks, agriculture and sports facilities". A new seaport and airport would be built near the Egyptian border, and there would a "trilateral crossing" where the Egyptian and Israeli borders converge. Redevelopment would be divided into four phases, starting in Rafah and then gradually moving north towards Gaza City. The map also featured an empty strip of land running along the Egyptian and Israeli borders. It appeared to mark what Trump's 20-point peace plan refers to as the "security perimeter" where Israeli forces will remain "until Gaza is properly secure". Another slide said "New Rafah" would have more than 100,000 permanent housing units, 200 education centres and 75 medical facilities. About 280,000 people once lived in Gaza's southernmost city, but it has been largely levelled by Israeli strikes and controlled demolitions during the war and is currently located inside Israeli-controlled territory. Kushner said he believed it was "doable" to complete the construction of "New Rafah" in two to three years. "We've already started removing the rubble and doing some of the demolition. And then New Gaza. It could be a hope, it could be a destination, have a lot of industry." In the coming weeks, he added, there would be a conference in Washington where contributions from countries would be announced and "amazing investment opportunities" for the private sector outlined. Last February, Trump sparked outrage around the world when he suggested that Gaza's Palestinians could be permanently relocated to neighbouring countries, with the US taking over the territory to transform it into "the Riviera of the Middle East". Kushner also declared that the demilitarisation of Gaza was "starting now", noting that "without security nobody is going to make investments". He said the territory's new technocratic Palestinian government, the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG), would be "working with Hamas on demilitarisation to really take the principles that were agreed to in the document to the next phase". Hamas has previously refused to give up its weapons without the creation of an independent Palestinian state. But Trump warned the group: "They have to give up their weapons and if they don't do that, it's going to be the end of them." Trump also insisted Hamas hand over the body of the last dead Israeli hostage in Gaza, which Israel said should have happened before phase two of the peace plan began last week. Under phase one, Hamas and Israel agreed to the ceasefire, an exchange of all living and dead Israeli hostages in Gaza for Palestinians detained in Israeli jails, a partial Israeli withdrawal, and a surge in deliveries of humanitarian aid. The ceasefire has remained fragile, with at least 477 Palestinians killed in Israeli strikes over the past three months, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. The Israeli military says three of its soldiers have been killed in attacks by Palestinian armed groups. Five people were reportedly killed by Israeli fire across Gaza on Thursday, four of them in an artillery strike in the eastern Zeitoun neighbourhood of Gaza City. Humanitarian conditions also still dire, with almost 1 million people lacking adequate shelter and 1.6 million facing high levels of acute food insecurity, according to the UN. Hamas put out a statement on Thursday saying that it remained committed to the October agreement and accusing Israel of seeking to "undermine international efforts aimed at consolidating the ceasefire". Speaking at Davos, Israeli President Isaac Herzog praised the "efforts of President Trump and his leadership". But he warned: "The real test has to be Hamas leaving Gaza". President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority (PA), which governs in parts of the occupied West Bank, called for the full implementation of the peace plan, including the withdrawal of Israeli forces, and a central role for the PA in administering Gaza. The head of the NCAG, Ali Shaath, meanwhile announced that the Rafah border crossing with Egypt would open next week in both directions. It has been mostly closed since May 2024, when the Palestinian side was seized by Israeli forces. "Opening Rafah signals that Gaza is no longer closed to the future and to the war," he said. The war was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. Israel responded to the attack by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 71,560 people have been killed, according to the territory's health ministry.

### 3. [France seizes suspected Russian 'shadow fleet' oil tanker in the Mediterranean](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdexxr2y907o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

France seizes suspected Russian 'shadow fleet' oil tanker in the Mediterranean France says it has seized an oil tanker in the Mediterranean suspected of being part of Russia's sanction-busting "shadow fleet". French President Emmanuel Macron said the tanker, named the Grinch, was "subject to international sanctions and suspected of flying a false flag". The French navy, with the assistance of allies including the UK, boarded the vessel on Thursday morning between Spain and Morocco. French maritime authorities said that a search of the vessel had "confirmed the doubts as to the regularity of the flag". Russia's embassy in Paris said it had not been informed of the seizure. Moscow's so-called shadow fleet is a clandestine network of tankers used to evade Western sanctions on Russian oil exports by shipping the oil on aged tankers with obscure ownership or insurance. The Grinch was travelling from the Arctic port of Murmansk in northern Russia when it was intercepted, French authorities said. The vessel had been flying a Comoros flag, according to ship tracking websites marinetraffic and vesselfinder. Announcing the seizure on X, Macron said: "We are determined to uphold international law and to ensure the effective enforcement of sanctions. "The activities of the "shadow fleet" contribute to financing the war of aggression against Ukraine," he said, adding that the vessel had been "diverted". Defence Secretary John Healy said the UK navy had provided "tracking and monitoring" support, with HMS Dagger monitoring the tanker through the Straits of Gibraltar. He added: "Alongside our allies, we are stepping up our response to shadow vessels to choke off the funds that fuel Putin's illegal invasion of Ukraine." The UK has imposed sanctions on 544 Russian shadow fleet vessels. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky welcomed the action, saying it was "exactly the kind of resolve needed to ensure that Russian oil no longer finances Russia's war". "Vessels must be apprehended. And wouldn't it be fair to confiscate and sell the oil carried by these tankers?" he said on X. Speaking at Davos earlier, Zelensky exhorted Europe to do more to ensure its own security, saying: "Europe loves to discuss the future but avoids taking action". Many Western countries imposed sanctions on Russian energy following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Earlier in January, British armed forces supported a US operation to seize a Russian-flagged tanker in the Atlantic that US officials said had broken sanctions by carrying oil for Venezuela and Russia. Moscow denounced the move, saying no state had the right to use force against vessels properly registered in other states' jurisdictions. Last October, France seized another sanctioned tanker, the Boracay, off its west coast before releasing it a few days later. Shadow fleets are becoming increasingly common, with Venezuela, Iran and Russia all accused of using them to avoid sanctions on oil. Financial intelligence firm S&P Global estimates that one in five oil tankers worldwide are used to smuggle oil from sanctioned countries.

### 4. [ICE detains five-year-old and father in Minnesota, lawyer says](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyrrqwxpz7o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

ICE detains five-year-old and father in Minnesota, lawyer says US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers detained a five-year-old boy on Tuesday during an immigration enforcement operation, Minnesota school officials and the family's lawyer have said. Pre-schooler Liam Ramos was with his father - named by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) as Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias - when Conejo Arias was approached by agents on his driveway. In a statement posted on X, the DHS said "ICE did NOT target a child", but was conducting an operation against his father, an "illegal alien" who "abandoned" his son when approached. Zena Stenvik, the Columbia Heights Public Schools superintendent, asked: "Why detain a 5-year-old? "You can't tell me that this child is going to be classified as a violent criminal." Photos provided to the BBC by the school district show a boy, identified as Liam Ramos, wearing a bunny-shaped winter hat, standing outside as an officer holds on to his backpack. The Columbia Heights Public Schools authority described these as bystander photos. The district did not identify the individuals who took the pictures, referring to them as "known and confirmed community members". Marc Prokosch, a lawyer representing the family, told a press conference on Wednesday that Liam and his father were being held at a detention centre in San Antonio, Texas, and attorneys were trying to contact them. Prokosch said the boy and his father had come to the US in 2024 from Ecuador to seek asylum. "This family was not eluding ICE in any way," he said. "They were following all the established protocols." In a post on X, ICE denied the child had been detained. "A criminal illegal alien ABANDONED his child as he fled from ICE officers, and our officers ensured the child was kept SAFE in the bitter cold," the agency said. "ICE made multiple attempts to get the family inside the house to take custody of the child. "They refused to accept custody of the child. The father told officers he wanted the child to remain with him." The DHS did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment on the incident. School officials said an agent asked the child to knock on the door of the home to see if anyone else was there. The boy had just arrived home from pre-school at the time of the apprehension, Stenvik told the press conference. She said another adult living in the home asked to take the young boy inside, but was refused. School board member Mary Granlund said she was on the scene and told immigration officials she could take Liam Ramos, but they still detained him. US Vice-President JD Vance, who visited Minnesota on Thursday amid ongoing protests against immigration enforcement, told reporters that ICE had detained the child because "the father ran". "What are they supposed to do?" he said of ICE agents. "Are they supposed to let a 5-year-old child freeze to death? "Are they not supposed to arrest an illegal alien in the United States of America?" Stenvik said that ICE had recently detained a total of four students in her school district, including a 10-year-old, and two 17-year-olds. "The onslaught of ICE activity in our community is inducing trauma," Stenvik said at a news conference on Thursday. The DHS maintains it is arresting the "worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens" in an effort to restore public safety in Minnesota. At a DHS press conference on Tuesday, Gregory Bovino of the US Border Patrol discussed the wider operation and said: "Our operations are lawful, are targeted, and are focused on individuals who pose a serious threat to this community." The mission, dubbed Operation Metro Surge, has sparked outcry from residents in Minneapolis, St Paul and other cities in the state. On 7 January, a federal officer fatally shot a woman named Renee Good in Minneapolis, sparking protests and condemnation from local and state officials. The Trump administration alleged the 37-year-old was using her vehicle as a weapon and the officer acted in self-defence. Also on Thursday, seven Democrats in the US House of Representatives crossed the aisle to vote with Republicans to narrowly pass $1.2tn (£900bn) in government funding, including money for ICE. The measure - which would allocate $64.4bn to DHS, including $10bn for ICE - was approved 220-207. The Democrats who voted in favour said they did so to fund the Transportation Security Administration and Federal Emergency Management Agency, both under DHS.

### 5. [German nurse jailed for murders could be linked to 100 more deaths](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgjjy55x2mo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

German nurse jailed for murders could be linked to 100 more deaths An ex-nurse convicted of murdering 10 patients in western Germany may be linked to more than 100 additional deaths, an official has said. The chief public prosecutor in Aachen, Katja Schlenkermann-Pitts, told the BBC that there was "a correspondingly high number of suspicious cases" under review. She cautioned that the cases represented preliminary suspicions and that some could be dismissed following forensic examination. In November last year, a regional court in Aachen convicted the former palliative care nurse, who has not been publicly named, of 10 counts of murder and 27 counts of attempted murder, sentencing him to life imprisonment. The court found that during night shifts at a hospital in Würselen, the man had administered excessive doses of sedatives and painkillers to seriously ill patients without medical justification. Prosecutors said the drugs were sometimes given repeatedly and that the defendant was aware of the potentially fatal consequences. Judges concluded that the actions were driven by personal unease and a desire to impose order during night shifts. The defendant denied the charges during the trial in Aachen, stating that he had intended to help patients sleep and had not believed the medication posed a lethal risk given their underlying illnesses. But prosecutors told the court that he showed "irritation" and a lack of empathy to patients who required a higher level of care, and accused him of playing "master of life and death". The offences examined in the initial trial occurred between December 2023 and May 2024 at the Rhein-Maas hospital in Würselen, where the nurse had worked since 2020. The newly identified suspected cases relate largely to earlier periods. As part of the expanded inquiry, investigators have ordered around 60 exhumations. Twenty seven have already been carried out, with roughly 30 more pending. Schlenkermann-Pitts said autopsy results were still outstanding in many cases and would determine whether further charges could be brought. "Of course, they may still be dropped," she cautioned. Prosecutors in Cologne are also examining deaths linked to hospitals where the nurse worked before his transfer to Würselen, 65km (40 miles) away. Two exhumations have taken place so far, including the remains of a 94 year old woman who died in 2018, and a 78 year old patient who died in 2015. Further exhumations have been ordered. Prosecutors in both Aachen and Cologne said preparations for potential new charges were under way, but officials said that any further proceedings were unlikely to begin before 2027. The case bears similarity to that of former nurse Niels Högel, who was handed a life sentence in 2019 after he was convicted of murdering 85 patients at two hospitals in northern Germany. Högel is believed to be the most prolific killer in Germany's modern history.

**Excerpt**

Vampire film Sinners breaks Oscar nominations record Vampire horror film Sinners has broken the record for the most Oscar nominations received by a single film, after being nominated for 16 of Hollywood's most coveted honours. The film beat the previous record of 14 nominations, and emerged ahead of its nearest rival this year, Leonardo DiCaprio's thriller One Battle After Another, which is up for 13 awards. Sinners' contenders include its star Michael B Jordan and his British co-stars Wunmi Mosaku and Delroy Lindo. Other big names up for trophies include Timothée Chalamet, who is hoping for third time lucky after two previous nominations, and Irish actress Jessie Buckley, who is the frontrunner to win best actress for Hamnet. However, there was no space for her co-star Paul Mescal, who starred opposite Buckley as William Shakespeare in Hamnet; while Wicked: For Good and its stars Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande missed out completely. The winners will be announced at a ceremony in Hollywood on 15 March. The leading films: Sinners - 16 - One Battle After Another - 13 - Marty Supreme - 9 - Frankenstein - 9 - Sentimental Value - 9 - Hamnet - 8 - Sinners 'more than just a horror' Sinners has exceeded expectations and bucked the trend that normally means horror films don't perform well at award ceremonies. It beat the previous record total of 14 nominations, achieved by All About Eve in 1951, Titanic in 1998 and La La Land in 2018. Michael B Jordan is nominated for best actor for playing twin brothers who return home to Mississippi in the 1930s to set up a juke joint, which is set upon by blood-sucking vampires. Other Sinners cast members to be nominated include British-Nigerian actress Wunmi Mosaku and co-star Delroy Lindo, who grew up in London, and the pair are carrying Britain's hopes for acting awards this year. Ryan Coogler is nominated for directing, writing and producing Sinners, with the film also shortlisted for the Oscars' top prize, best picture. BBC Radio 1 film critic Ali Plumb said: "The last time anything to do with a horror won best picture was The Silence of the Lambs in the early 1990s. That is a long time ago." He said it was good to see Sinners get "this broad a series of accolades and thumbs up from across the whole industry". It is "more than just a horror", he added. "Although obviously vampires are obviously involved, there's so much more to it." BBC culture editor Katie Razzall said: "It is to my mind the perfect blend of revenge thriller and sexy, decadent, musical journey through America's race issues, good against evil, the power of music - and redemption. "Who knew that combining vampires, KKK racists, ex-gangster twins (both played by Michael B Jordan), Mississippi delta folklore and blues history would pay off so spectacularly?" Losing the battle but winning the war? While Sinners deals with the spectre of racism in the American South, One Battle After Another gives a take on the current messy political climate in the US. Leonardo DiCaprio is nominated for best actor for playing a revolutionary battling an authoritarian US regime, whose past comes back to haunt him. The film has also scooped nominations for supporting cast members Benicio Del Toro, Sean Penn and Teyana Taylor, as well as director Paul Thomas Anderson. It has been the presumed favourite to win best picture throughout award season so far, and it could still pip Sinners to the top trophy in March. The frontrunner in the nominations doesn't always turn out to be the big winner on the night. In the past 21 years, the movie with the most nominations has gone on to win best picture just six times. Either way, the nominations are good news for Warner Bros, which made both Sinners and One Battle After Another, as it is in the process of being sold, possibly to Netflix. Chalamet eyes first Oscar DiCaprio and Jordan will face stiff competition from Timothee Chalamet, who is hotly tipped to win his first Oscar for his role in table tennis caper Marty Supreme. At 30, he has become the youngest man to receive three acting nominations since Marlon Brando. This year's best actor category is completed by Ethan Hawke, who has his fifth Oscar nomination for Blue Moon, and Brazilian actor Wagner Moura (The Secret Agent). At 37, Emma Stone has become the youngest woman to accumulate seven Oscar nominations after being recognised for Bugonia. She is listed for best actress alongside Kate Hudson (Song Sung Blue), Rose Byrne (If I Had Legs I'd Kick You) and Norway's Renate Reinsve (Sentimental Value) - but Buckley is regarded as the clear favourite in that race. Moura and Reinsve are among a record four acting nominations for non-English language performances - the others being Sweden's Stellan Skarsgård and Norwegian actress Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas, who are both in supporting categories for Sentimental Value. KPop characters v rock stars Fan favourite KPop Demon Hunters has been recognised in the Oscar nominations, too. The animated Netflix hit is in pole position to win best animated feature and best song, for mega-hit Golden. Co-writer of the track, Mark Sonnenblick, told BBC Newsbeat's Naomi de Souza that Thursday's Academy recognition had been the "icing on the cake". "The only reason that this morning [in Los Angeles] happened, regardless of the quality of the song or the movie or any of that, is just because fans responded to it and told other people to watch it and repost it and made fan videos," he said. There's no room, though, for the Wicked sequel. This time last year, the first film received 10 nominations, and the follow-up had been widely expected to join Golden in the best song race (for The Girl in the Bubble) and be nominated for prizes like best costume and make-up. But it missed out. Elsewhere in the music categories, Nick Cave is nominated for best song for the title song from Train Dreams, and Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood is nominated for best original score for One Battle After Another. Other British nominees include fellow composer Nicholas Pike, who is up for best original song for Viva Verdi!; while Northern Irish author Maggie O'Farrell is nominated for a screenplay award for adapting her novel Hamnet alongside director Chloe Zhao. Zhao has become only the second woman to be nominated for multiple best director Oscars, after Jane Campion. Zhao won that award for Nomadland in 2021. Meanwhile, the best documentary feature category includes Mr Nobody Against Putin, a BBC Storyville co-production.

**Excerpt**

UN to take over al-Hol camp for IS families in Syria after unrest The United Nations (UN) says it will take over management of a camp in north-eastern Syria holding holding thousands of people with alleged links to the jihadist group Islamic State (IS). It comes after Kurdish-led forces that had been running the camp withdrew in the face of an advance by Syrian government forces, triggering unrest that forced aid agencies to suspend operations. Residents were reported to have rushed camp perimeters in an apparent attempt to escape, prompting unrest and looting. A ceasefire agreement has brought much of Syria's north-east under the control of Damascus, ending years of autonomous Kurdish rule. Briefing the UN Security Council on Thursday, UN official Edem Wosornu said the UN refugee agency UNHCR had "taken over camp management responsibilities" at al-Hol and was working with Syrian authorities to restore humanitarian access. Syrian forces, she said, had established a security perimeter around the camp. However, UN spokesman Stéphane Dujarric cautioned that conditions inside remained "tense and volatile", with humanitarian operations still suspended following the violence. Meanwhile, the US has launched a parallel effort to remove high-risk detainees from the region altogether. US Central Command said on Wednesday that it had begun transferring up to 7,000 suspected IS fighters from prisons in northeast Syria to Iraq, confirming that 150 detainees had already been moved to a "secure location" across the border. Iraqi authorities said all transferred detainees would be prosecuted under Iraqi law. "This is a measure aimed at protecting regional and international security from an imminent threat. Nevertheless, we stress that this issue should not be left to become a long-term strategic burden on Iraq alone," Iraq's deputy UN ambassador, Mohammed Sahib Mejid Marzooq, said. Syria's UN ambassador Ibrahim Olabi said the Syrian government welcomed the US operation to transfer IS detainees out of Syrian territory and was ready to offer support. Rights groups have warned that the transfers could expose detainees to serious abuses. The Reprieve charity said it believed up to ten British men could be among those transferred, along with juvenile detainees and urged the UK government to intervene urgently. Around 55 to 60 British nationals, most of them children, remain detained across camps and prisons in the region, it said. "The prisoners transferred face being tortured, sentenced to death and executed, without being granted any meaningful opportunity to contest the allegations against them", Katherine Cornett, Reprieve's deputy director told the BBC. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), US and UN have long called for the repatriation of foreign IS suspects and their families from north-eastern Syria, citing the political instability and dire conditions in the prisons and camps, but many countries have refused to take them.

UK holds off joining Trump's Board of Peace over Putin concerns Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper has said the UK will not yet be signing up to US President Donald Trump's Board of Peace over concerns about Russian leader Vladimir Putin's possible participation. Cooper told the BBC the UK had been invited to join the board but "won't be one of the signatories today" at a ceremony at the World Economic Forum in Davos. The board, which gives Trump wide decision-making powers as chairman, is being billed by the US as a new international organisation for resolving conflicts. Cooper described the board as a "legal treaty that raises much broader issues" than the initiative's initial focus on ending the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. The charter proposed by the White House does not mention the Palestinian territory and critics say the board appears to be designed to replace some functions of the United Nations. Some of the US's traditional allies have not agreed to join the board and notably, none of the other permanent members of the UN Security Council - China, France, Russia, and the UK - have committed to participation so far. The UN Security Council has been the main international platform for global diplomacy and conflict resolution since the end of World War Two. But launching the board at a signing ceremony alongside world leaders in Davos, Trump said he did not intend it as a replacement for the UN and expressed his belief that it would help forge an "everlasting" peace in the Middle East. Trump said the board had the chance to be "one of the most consequential bodies ever created". "We're committed to ensuring Gaza is demilitarised, properly governed and beautifully rebuilt," Trump said. "It's going to be a great plan and this is where the board of peace started." Trump said once the board had been completely formed, "we can do pretty much whatever we want to do". "But we'll do it in conjunction with the United Nations," he added. President Trump was joined by the leaders and representatives of 19 countries for the Board of Peace signing ceremony, including Argentina, Hungary, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Turkey. President Trump also said Putin had accepted an invitation to join the initiative. But the Russian president has not confirmed this and earlier he said his country was still studying the invitation. Putin said the idea of using Russian assets frozen in the US as a contribution to the board would be discussed at a meeting with representatives of the Trump administration later on Thursday, according to Russian state news agency TASS. Speaking to the BBC's Breakfast programme from Davos, Cooper said the UK had received an invitation to join the board and strongly supported Trump's 20-point plan to end the war in Gaza. "That's why we are also clear we want to play our part in phase two of the Gaza peace process," Cooper said. But she added: "We won't be one of the signatories today because this is a legal treaty that raises much broader issues. "And we do also have concerns about President Putin being part of something that's talking about peace when we've still not seen any signs from Putin that there will be commitment to peace in Ukraine." She said Putin had shown no willingness "to come and make that agreement and that's where the pressure needs to be now". "But we will have continuing international discussions including with our allies," the foreign secretary said. Diplomatic relations between the US and the UK are on shakier ground after Trump threatened to impose tariffs on European nations if his demand to hand control of Greenland to his country was not met. But Trump appears to have backed down, saying the US was exploring a potential deal on Greenland after talks with the Nato security alliance, as he dropped planned tariffs on eight European countries and ruled out using force to take the island. Cooper welcomed the apparent climbdown on Greenland and said the UK and its European allies had put forward "positive, constructive proposals" on security in the Arctic. But when asked about the Board of Peace, Cooper echoed other UK cabinet ministers who in recent days have been expressing concerns over Putin's potential role in the scheme, given Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine. The UK has been one of Ukraine's staunchest allies and together with France, signed a declaration of intent on deploying troops to the country if a peace deal is made with Russia. Trump's Board of Peace was originally unveiled by the White House as part of a plan to rebuild Gaza and design its future governance. But the leaked text of the board's founding charter goes far beyond that purpose. The text says the board would be "an international organisation that seeks to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict". The leaked document says the Board of Peace's charter will enter into force once three states formally agree to be bound by it, with member states given renewable three-year terms and permanent seats available to those contributing $1bn (£740m), it said. The charter declared the body as an international organisation mandated to carry out peace-building functions under international law, with Trump serving as chairman - and separately as the US representative - and holding authority to appoint executive board members and create or dissolve subsidiary bodies. Last Friday, the White House named seven members of the founding Executive Board, including US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair. More have now said they will join it, including Pakistan, Egypt and Qatar. The Vatican has said the Pope has also received an invitation.

Two dead and several missing in New Zealand landslides Two people have died and several are feared buried after landslides in New Zealand's North Island. The deaths were reported at Welcome Bay, while rescue workers are still searching through rubble at a different site in a popular campground on Mount Maunganui. There are no "signs of life", authorities said, adding that they have a "rough idea" of how many people are missing but are waiting for an exact figure. They provided no other details except that the group includes "at least one young girl". The landslides were triggered by heavy rains over the last few days, which led to flooding and power outages across the North Island. One minister said the east coast resembled "a war zone". New Zealand is "heavy with grief" after the "profound tragedy" caused by recent weather, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said on X. Footage from the campsite on Mount Maunganui, an extinct volcano, shows a huge slip near the base of the volcanic dome, as rescuers and sniffer dogs comb through crushed caravans and flattened tents. Authorities said that the search would continue through the night. "This is a complex and high-risk environment, and our teams are working to achieve the best possible outcome while keeping everyone safe," said Megan Stiffler, the deputy national commander for the Urban Search and Rescue team, The extinct volcano is a sacred Māori site and one of the most popular campgrounds in New Zealand, with a local holiday website describing it as a "slice of paradise". But it has been repeatedly hit by landslides in recent years. "I heard this huge tree crack and all this dirt come off, and then I looked behind me and there's this huge landslide coming down," Australian tourist Sonny Worrall told local broadcaster TVNZ. "I'm still shaking from it now... I turned around and had to jump out of my seat and just run,"he added. He saw it happen while swimming in a hot pool. Hiker Mark Tangney told the New Zealand Herald he heard people screaming from under the rubble. "So I just parked up and ran to help... We could hear people screaming: 'Help us, help us, get us out of here'," he said. Those calls persisted for about half an hour and then went silent, Tangney said. A surf club in another part of Mount Maunganui has been evacuated following fears of more landslides. A state of emergency has been declared in the Bay of Plenty where Mount Maunganui sits, and various parts of the North Island, including Northland, Coromandel, Tairāwhiti and Hauraki. Several areas reported their wettest days on record on Thursday. Tauranga in the Bay of Plenty, for example, received three months worth of rain within a day, according to local media. Some 8,000 people were without power as of Thursday morning, Radio New Zealand (RNZ) reported. The wife of a man who was swept away in the Mahurangi River is holding out hope that he will survive. "I know his personality is strong, wise," she told RNZ, adding that he was a fisherman back home in Kiribati and knew how to swim and dive. The man, 47, was driving to work with their nephew when the car they were in fell into the river. He had pushed the nephew towards a branch so the nephew could hoist himself onto land; but the older man did not manage get back up himself, according to the report. "It's been a very big event for us as a country, really hitting almost our entire eastern seaboard of the North Island," said Minister for Emergency Management Mark Mitchell. "The good news is that everyone responded really quickly, and there was time to get prepared. That helps to mitigate and create a very strong response," he told RNZ. December to February are typically the sunnier months in New Zealand but in recent years heavy rains and storms have become more frequent. In February 2023, parts of the island were devastated by Cyclone Gabrielle, which is to date the costliest cyclone to hit the Southern Hemisphere, with damage amounting to NZ$13.5bn ($7.9bn; £5.9bn). This week's flooding has added to the toll for the local communities that are still rebuilding. Additional reporting by Vandhna Bhan and Koh Ewe

Japan suspends world's largest nuclear plant hours after restart Japan has suspended operations at the world's largest nuclear power plant, hours after its restart, its operator has said. An alarm sounded "during reactor-start-up procedures" at Kashiwazaki-Kariwa north-west of Tokyo but the reactor remained "stable", Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco) spokesperson Takashi Kobayashi said. Reactor number six restarted on Wednesday a day later than planned due to an alarm malfunction - the first at the plant to be turned on since the 2011 Fukushima disaster. Japan shut down all of its 54 reactors after a 9.0 magnitude earthquake triggered a meltdown at its Fukushima plant 15 years ago, causing one of the worst nuclear disasters in history. At the time, radiation leakage from the plant forced more than 150,000 people to evacuate their homes. Many have not returned despite assurances it is now safe. Following the suspension of reactor number six on Thursday, Kobayashi said it was "stable and there is no radioactive impact outside". The reactor was initially set to start on Tuesday, but was pushed back due to a technical issue. It is due to begin operating commercially next month. Kobayashi said Tepco was "currently investigating the cause" of the incident and did not say when operations would resume. The seventh reactor at Kashiwazaki-Kariwa is not expected to be turned back on until 2030, while the other five could be decommissioned. This would leave the plant with far less capacity than it once had when all seven reactors were operational. Reactor number six was given the green light to restart despite safety concerns from local residents. A small crowd of people gathered outside Tepco's headquarters to protest last week, while hundreds gathered outside the Niigata prefectural assembly in December. Japan was an early adopter of nuclear power - before 2011, nuclear accounted for nearly 30% of its electricity and the country planned to get that up to 50% by 2030. After it was forced to shut them all down in the wake of the Fukushima disaster, it has spent the past decade attempting to revive the plants as part of its goal to reach net zero emissions by 2050. Since 2015, Japan has restarted 15 out of its 33 operable reactors. An earlier version of this story said the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear plant was in Tokyo and has been corrected to say it is north-west of Tokyo.

Three dead in shooting in Australia's New South Wales Three people have been killed and another injured after a shooting in a small town in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Emergency services were called to a residential area in Lake Cargelligo at about 16:40 local time (05:40 GMT) on Thursday. Police are searching for Julian Ingram, 37, in connection with the killings. A man and woman were found shot dead in a vehicle, and a second shooting soon afterwards killed a woman and left a man in a "critical condition" in hospital, police said. Australian newspaper The Sydney Morning Herald reported that the incident was a suspected domestic violence attack and that one of the victims is believed to be Ingram's former partner. Andrew Holland, NSW police assistant commissioner, declined to comment on the relationship between the gunman and the victims. The public was urged to remain indoors and multiple crime scenes have been established, he told reporters. NSW police later released a photograph of Ingram and urged the public to get in contact with any information on his whereabouts. "Any death in a small country town is confronting, but again, a scene where you have people shot by firearms is obviously going to make people very, very tense and very concerned," Holland said. "The scene faced by the emergency services officers at that time would have been horrendous." Lake Cargelligo is located in the centre of New South Wales and has a population of about 1,500 people. The incident comes after last month's mass shooting at Sydney's Bondi Beach which killed 15 people.

**Excerpt**

What we know about Trump's 'framework of future deal' over Greenland US President Donald Trump has announced there is a "framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland". Wednesday's statement came as a surprise after days and weeks of mounting tensions - even a threat to use military force to seize the semi-autonomous territory of Nato ally Denmark. So what could this deal entail and will it be acceptable to Denmark and Greenland - both of which have made it clear they will not relinquish sovereignty of the world's largest island in the Arctic? What has been said about the framework deal? President Trump made the announcement after talks at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. "Based upon a very productive meeting that I have had with the Secretary General of NATO, Mark Rutte, we have formed the framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland," he said on his Truth Social media platform. He did not give details, but said talks would continue to reach the agreement. Rutte said he had not discussed the key issue of Danish sovereignty over Greenland in his meeting with Trump. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Danes could negotiate on everything, but "we cannot negotiate on our sovereignty". Greenland's prime minister echoed Frederiksen, saying sovereignty was "a red line". Significantly, Jens-Frederik Nielsen said he did not know the details of the deal being discussed. Is there any detail? What are the options? Citing anonymous officials, the New York Times said one idea entailed Denmark ceding sovereignty over small areas of Greenland where the US would build military bases. This arrangement would be similar to the status of two such bases in Cyprus, which have been under UK sovereignty since Cyprus became independent in 1960. It is not clear how that model would apply if both Denmark and Greenland reject relinquishing sovereignty. In arguing in favour of seizing Greenland, Trump has mentioned the threat of Chinese and Russian vessels around the island, even though Denmark says there is no threat "today". On this point, Nato allies have tried to reassure the US that they will boost security in the Arctic and Mark Rutte says the framework deal will also require this contribution. "I have no doubt we can do this quite fast. Certainly I would hope for 2026, I hope even early in 2026," he said on Thursday. UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said the UK had called for setting up an Arctic Sentry "very similar to the approach that Nato has taken to the Baltic Sentry" - a mission to increase the surveillance of ships in the Baltic Sea. Will any deal short of 'ownership' please Trump? Under a 1951 agreement with Denmark, the US can send as many troops as it wants to Greenland. It already has more than 100 military personnel permanently stationed at its Pituffik base in the north-western tip of the territory. So discussions to reach a deal may centre on a renegotiation of that agreement, according to US officials. Hovering over negotiations is Trump's insistence to "own" Greenland. If he were to have his way, in addition to overcoming the red lines over sovereignty, negotiators would also need to find a solution to the constitutional ban on the sale of land in Greenland. One model is offered by the US naval base at Guantánamo Bay in Cuba, which has been under total US control since 1903 after a kind of permanent lease agreement. It is not clear whether these were some of the options that prompted Trump's U-turn at Davos to drop the threat of military action to annex Greenland to the relief of his Nato allies. Nato was founded in 1949 on the principle that an external attack on one ally is an attack on all. Denmark had made it clear that a military attack by an ally on another would spell the end of the trans-Atlantic alliance, where the US is the major partner. The fact that Trump's announcement of a "framework" came after he met Mark Rutte has prompted some concern in Greenland that negotiations on their future were being conducted in their absence. On Thursday, Greenland's Foreign Minister Vivian Motzfeldt said his government had not asked him to negotiate on their behalf but to convey "the red lines directly to President Trump". Rutte has not confirmed this has been the case. He has been criticised for the praise he has constantly showered on President Trump. Why does Trump want Greenland? Is it minerals? Trump says Greenland is essential for his plan to build a Golden Dome defence system, designed to protect the US against missile attacks from Russia and China, and that European allies could co-operate in this endeavour. The island has vast - and largely untapped - reserves of rare earth minerals, many of which are crucial for technologies including mobile phones and electric vehicles. Trump has not said the US is after Greenland's riches, but that a US control over the island "puts everybody in a really good position, especially as it pertains to security and to minerals".

**Excerpt**

Rapid rollback of Kurdish-led forces reshapes Sharaa's Syria President Ahmed al-Sharaa has made significant advances in his efforts to unify a deeply fractured Syria, reclaiming large swathes of territory in the north-east that had been under the control of a Kurdish-led militia alliance for more than a decade. What happens next will be a test for a government that has tried to assert its authority over the whole country. The gains by government forces in a lightning offensive against the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) marked the biggest change of control in Syria since Islamist-led rebels toppled Bashar al-Assad in December 2024, ending the 13-year civil war. Before this month's push, nearly a third of Syria's territory was controlled by the Kurds, who enjoyed American support after helping a US-led coalition defeat the jihadist group Islamic State (IS) in the last decade. There, they ran an enclave with its own government and institutions, with the SDF being its military arm. The offensive came amid stalled talks between Sharaa's government and the SDF about the key issue of integrating its forces into the country's institutions. A deal was signed last March, but a year-end deadline expired with little progress as the SDF remained reluctant to give up its autonomy. The militia alliance, analysts say, miscalculated in its negotiations with the government, seeming to believe it would have the backing of its longtime ally. But the US under President Donald Trump has strongly supported Sharaa, who has defended his vision of a united Syria under the control of Damascus. Trump hosted Sharaa, who was once branded a terrorist by the US for his former links to al-Qaeda, at the White House last year, and lifted devastating sanctions imposed on Syria in the Assad years. When Sharaa's forces started their push, there was no apparent US objection. On Sunday, after suffering stunning territorial losses, the SDF agreed on a 14-point deal that reversed almost all concessions it had gained from the government in earlier negotiations. Crucially, its members are expected to join the Syrian army and interior ministry as individuals - and not as separate units, as it had demanded - while the control of oil and gas fields, important for Syria's economic recovery, will be transferred to the government. SDF-run prisons and camps holding thousands of IS detainees and family members are also being brought under Damascus' control. The announcement came days after Sharaa issued a decree that was seen as an attempt to reach out to the Kurds, whose rights had been denied in the five-decade rule by the Assads: it designated Kurdish as a national language, granted Syrian nationality to stateless Kurds, and declared the Nowruz - the Persian new year - a national holiday. Fighting, however, erupted again. So far, the areas reclaimed by government forces have been mainly Arab, where locals had resentments against the SDF. But the troops continued to move towards Kurdish-majority areas, raising the prospect of deadly clashes, and reportedly angering Washington. On Tuesday, Sharaa's government suddenly announced a ceasefire, giving the SDF four days to present a detailed plan for the integration of areas under its control into the state. This halted the move of his army and prevented the escalation of the violence, for now. Since coming to power after the fall of the Assad regime, Sharaa has repeatedly vowed to protect Syria's minorities. But the country has seen deadly bouts of sectarian violence. Last year, government forces were accused of atrocities after being sent to the Mediterranean coast, which is the heartland of Assad's Alawite sect, and the mainly Druze southern province of Suweida. Kurds fear the same could happen to them, despite renewed guarantees offered by Sharaa. For the Kurds, the losses are a fatal blow to the aspirations of preserving their autonomy, with the US position being seen as a betrayal. Tom Barrack, the US special envoy, said the "original purpose" of the partnership with the SDF, as the main anti-IS force in Syria, had "largely expired", and that the "greatest opportunity for the Kurds in Syria" lay in the transition under Sharaa, whose government is seen by Western countries as the best chance to guarantee Syria's stability. The dramatic changes empower Sharaa but are likely to renew calls for him to decentralise authority, with critics saying key posts have been limited to his allies. It could also indicate what he may be planning to do in other areas of the country, including those held by the Druze, who demand autonomy.

**Excerpt**

Slashed incomes and gamers go cold turkey: the fallout from Uganda's internet shutdown Mobile money agent Mirembe Tracy laments that her business in Uganda's bustling capital Kampala was paralysed when the government shut the internet during last week's fiercely contested general election. "All withdrawals were disconnected," she tells the BBC, adding that she gets nearly all of her income from withdrawal commissions. Without it, her income dropped to zero. "In one week I can earn up to 450,000 [Ugandan] shillings (£96; $130). That money is what I use to pay rent. Losing it was a total loss," she says. For two days either side of the election, there was nothing she could do but stay at home - she could only sell prepaid airtime credit, which she says does not "give a commission". Uganda's communications authority ordered the nationwide shutdown to "ensure peace, protect national stability and prevent the misuse of communication platforms during a sensitive national exercise". Th opposition said it was a move to cover up voter fraud and stop its agents from sharing the results from polling stations. Either way, it brought many aspects of modern life to a halt. Online businesses that rely on mobile money transactions were most affected by the blackout, with some coming to a standstill while others reverted to cash-based transactions. Kampala is famous for its ubiquitous boda boda (motorcycle) taxis, with many operators earning their income through online ride-hailing apps. The co-founder of SafeBoda told local media that the platform's entire server was down during the internet suspension, with many riders forced off the road and other businesses that depend on the service deprived of their income. Namukwaya Olivia, who sells traditional cultural clothing and depends heavily on Instagram, TikTok and WhatsApp to reach customers, says she did not make any deliveries during the period. She tells the BBC that many of her customers ask for pictures before deciding on what to buy. "We could not send pictures, we could not receive orders, and we could not make deliveries," the businesswoman says. She adds that the effect of the shutdown was immediate, and made it difficult to cover basic costs. "We couldn't pay rent during that period," she says. "Even now, things have not fully recovered because customers still struggle to access us online." Journalist Ngabo Amon says his smartphone, a work tool for him, became largely useless. "You have a phone, but there is nothing to do with it," he tells the BBC. He could no longer research stories, follow election developments or send material to his newsroom. He says everyday life transformed into anxious stretches of waiting for the internet to be restored. Some households reverted to watching television to keep themselves occupied, either watching live, or buying downloaded old movies from shops. "People bought what they could afford, went back home and just watched, because there were no other options," Ngabo says. Some young people found it difficult to cope. Ronnie Mwesigwa, 20, says he lost contact with friends and had no access to online entertainment. "I couldn't communicate with anyone, and even gaming was gone," he says. "It was not a good situation." To pass his time, the gamer turned to content already stored on his phone, only viewing his gallery. "That was all I could do." Ngabo explains that the situation was especially frustrating for journalists covering the election, as the blackout made it impossible to get a real picture of what was unfolding on the ground. "You are talking about people rioting, about tension on the streets, but the audience is only seeing your photo and hearing your voice, and it is not satisfying for the journalist or the viewer," he points out. President Yoweri Museveni, 81, won the vote by a landslide to extend his 40-year-rule and has accused the opposition of seeking to overturn the results through violence. Bobi Wine, his closest challenger maintains the results are "fake" and has cited "ballot stuffing". According to a report by the African Union (AU) election observation mission, "the internet shutdown limited access to information, freedom of association [and] curtailed economic activities". It also notes that the shutdown "created suspicion and mistrust" in the election process. Ngabo says that the situation was worse in rural areas. With no internet access, some journalists were forced to physically transport their footage back to their newsrooms. He gives an example of videos, made early on the morning of the elections in a remote rural area, reaching Kampala by bus in the evening. "By that time, results are already being discussed and tallied and nobody is interested in the footage any more," he says. Caroline Mutai, a Kenya-based journalist who went to Uganda to cover the elections, says the shutdown "almost gave me depression". She describes the difficulties she faced trying to send back material to her newsroom, spending days searching for places with internet, only to be blocked or chased away. The shutdown also cut her off from family at a time of heightened insecurity. "When you are tired and stressed after work, you want to talk to people who are close to you," she says. "But you cannot reach them, and that makes the situation even harder." For students, the blackout disrupted both communication and learning. Aaron Benitez, a final-year school pupil, says he was unable to contact his family during a period of uncertainty. "I needed to know what was happening with my family and what was going on in the country," he tells the BBC. "But I could not connect with them at all." Online learning also came to a halt. Teachers could not send notes or assignments, and group discussions normally held online were cancelled. "Our master could not send notes on WhatsApp," the student says. "We usually study online, sometimes on Zoom, but during that time everything just stopped." He adds that access remains slow and unreliable, despite the election being over. "It is back, but it is still very slow. Some materials cannot load properly, and that affects our studies." The government partially restored the internet after Museveni was declared the winner on Saturday. Some platforms, especially social media, remain slow or restricted, pushing many young people to reconnect using a VPN (virtual private network), which can disguise its online location. For many, the shutdown was not just a temporary inconvenience but a stark reminder of how deeply digital access shapes their everyday life.

Record snowfall leaves cars stuck and people stranded in Russia's Far East Parts of Russia's Far East have been buried under its heaviest snowfall in 60 years, as scientists say the winter blast could be due to climate change affecting Arctic air patterns. In Kamchatka Peninsula, locals were seen shovelling in the streets, as rescuers helped people trapped in their homes. Public transportation was partially suspended in the regional capital, Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, after the height of the snow reached approximately 10 feet.
