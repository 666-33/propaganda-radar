US allies won't forget Trump Greenland crisis What on earth has the last fortnight been all about? In the wake of a successful military operation in Venezuela earlier this month, a buoyed-up Donald Trump started to ratchet up the rhetoric on Greenland. Day after day, the world was treated to claims of ownership, threats of military action and tariffs against traditional allies in Europe. Now, in an apparent puff of smoke, it may all have gone. Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte, arguably the Trump whisperer-in-chief, seems to have talked the president down from his dangerously high hobby horse. The ground may have been laid last week during a visit to Washington by the foreign ministers of Denmark and Greenland. The visit concluded with agreement on a "working group" to discuss Greenland's future. But Rutte appears to have finessed an issue that had threatened to shatter the north Atlantic alliance. We don't yet know the details of the deal, but many will wonder why it needed a frenetic two-week crisis to get here. Denmark had long said that it was only too happy to see an increased American military presence on Greenland. If Nato has now pledged to up its presence on and around the island, then that will go some way towards reassuring Donald Trump that the alliance is finally paying proper attention to Greenland. The New York Times quotes anonymous officials as saying one idea under discussion is for Denmark to cede sovereignty over small areas of Greenland where the US would build military bases - similar to the arrangement by which the UK maintains sovereign bases on Cyprus. Trump said the deal would involve access to Greenland's mineral resources. Neither Denmark nor Nato has confirmed these or any other reports. Nato said discussions would "focus on ensuring Arctic security through the collective efforts, especially the seven Arctic Allies" (the US, Canada, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Iceland) and aimed to prevent Russia and China from gaining a foothold, economic or military, in Greenland. It won't be long before details of the deal emerge. But the fact that Donald Trump triggered a fortnight of high drama and a sense of existential crisis within Nato to get here will not easily be forgotten. Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney called it a "rupture", saying the old order was "not coming back." EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen spoke of "seismic change" and urged greater European independence. It's hard to see a quick return to business as usual.

UK holds off joining Trump's peace board over Putin concerns Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper has said the UK will not yet be signing up to US President Donald Trump's proposed Board of Peace over concerns about Russian leader Vladimir Putin's possible participation. Cooper told the BBC the UK had been invited to join the board but "won't be one of the signatories today" at a planned ceremony at the World Economic Forum in Davos. The foreign secretary described the board as a "legal treaty that raises much broader issues" than the board's initial focus on ending the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. The charter proposed by the White House does not mention the Palestinian territory and appears to be designed to replace some functions of the United Nations. Countries including Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt and Israel have said they will become members of the board, and at Davos, President Trump said Putin had accepted an invitation to join the initiative. But President Putin has not confirmed this and earlier he said his country was still studying the invitation. Speaking to the BBC's Breakfast programme from Davos, Cooper said the UK had received an invitation to join the board and strongly supported Trump's 20-point plan to end the war in Gaza. "That's why we are also clear we want to play our part in phase two of the Gaza peace process," Cooper said. But she added: "We won't be one of the signatories today because this is a legal treaty that raises much broader issues. "And we do also have concerns about President Putin being part of something that's talking about peace when we've still not seen any signs from Putin that there will be commitment to peace in Ukraine." She said Putin had shown no willingness "to come and make that agreement and that's where the pressure needs to be now". "But we will have continuing international discussions including with our allies," the foreign secretary said. Cooper echoed other UK cabinet ministers who in recent days have been expressing concerns over President Putin's potential role on the board, given Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine. As talks to end the war in Ukraine continue, President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky are due to meet in Davos on Thursday. On Wednesday, Trump repeated his oft-stated belief that Putin and Zelensky were close to a deal.

Three dead in shooting in Australia's New South Wales Three people have died after a reported shooting in a small town in New South Wales, Australia, police say. A fourth person has been taken to hospital in a serious but stable condition. Local police are now investigating the reported shooting which took place in Lake Cargelligo at about 16:40 local time (05:40 GMT). Police have also told the public to avoid the area and that local residents should stay inside. Local reports say that the gunman is still at large. A police statement said emergency services were called to Walker Street near Yelkin Street following reports of the shooting. Two women and a man have died. The Sydney Morning Herald reports that the incident was a suspected domestic violence attack. It also reports that authorities are still trying to locate the gunman and that heavily armed tactical police have been deployed. Seven News reports that the gunman had fled the scene in a vehicle owned by the local council. Lake Cargelligo is located in the centre of New South Wales and has a population of about 1,500 people. The incident comes after last month's mass shooting at Sydney's Bondi Beach which killed 15 people.

**Excerpt**

Japan suspends world's largest nuclear plant hours after restart Japan has suspended operations at the world's largest nuclear power plant, hours after its restart, its operator has said. An alarm sounded "during reactor-start-up procedures" at Kashiwazaki-Kariwa in Tokyo but the reactor remained "stable", Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco) spokesperson Takashi Kobayashi said. Reactor number six restarted on Wednesday a day later than planned due to an alarm malfunction - the first at the plant to be turned on since the 2011 Fukashima disaster. Japan shut down all of its 54 reactors after a 9.0 magnitude earthquake triggered a meltdown at its Fukashima plant 15 years ago, causing one of the worst nuclear disasters in history. At the time, radiation leakage from the plant forced more than 150,000 people to evacuate their homes. Many have not returned despite assurances it is now safe. Following the suspension of reactor number six on Thursday, Kobayashi said it was "stable and there is no radioactive impact outside". The reactor was initially set to start on Tuesday, but was pushed back due to a technical issue. It is due to begin operating commercially next month. Kobayashi said Tepco was "currently investigating the cause" of the incident and did not say when operations would resume. The seventh reactor at Kashiwazaki-Kariwa is not expected to be turned back on until 2030, while the other five could be decommissioned. This would leave the plant with far less capacity than it once had when all seven reactors were operational. Reactor number six was given the green light to restart despite safety concerns from local residents. A small crowd of people gathered outside Tepco's headquarters to protest last week, while hundreds gathered outside the Niigata prefectural assembly in December. Japan was an early adopter of nuclear power - before 2011, nuclear accounted for nearly 30% of its electricity and the country planned to get that up to 50% by 2030. After it was forced to shut them all down in the wake of the Fukashima disaster, it has spent the past decade attempting to revive the plants as part of its goal to reach net zero emissions by 2050. Since 2015, Japan has restarted 15 out of its 33 operable reactors.

**Excerpt**

Slashed incomes and gamers go cold turkey: the fallout from Uganda's internet shutdown Mobile money agent Mirembe Tracy laments that her business in Uganda's bustling capital Kampala was paralysed when the government shut the internet during last week's fiercely contested general election. "All withdrawals were disconnected," she tells the BBC, adding that she gets nearly all of her income from withdrawal commissions. Without it, her income dropped to zero. "In one week I can earn up to 450,000 [Ugandan] shillings (£96; $130). That money is what I use to pay rent. Losing it was a total loss," she says. For two days either side of the election, there was nothing she could do but stay at home - she could only sell prepaid airtime credit, which she says does not "give a commission". Uganda's communications authority ordered the nationwide shutdown to "ensure peace, protect national stability and prevent the misuse of communication platforms during a sensitive national exercise". Th opposition said it was a move to cover up voter fraud and stop its agents from sharing the results from polling stations. Either way, it brought many aspects of modern life to a halt. Online businesses that rely on mobile money transactions were most affected by the blackout, with some coming to a standstill while others reverted to cash-based transactions. Kampala is famous for its ubiquitous boda boda (motorcycle) taxis, with many operators earning their income through online ride-hailing apps. The co-founder of SafeBoda told local media that the platform's entire server was down during the internet suspension, with many riders forced off the road and other businesses that depend on the service deprived of their income. Namukwaya Olivia, who sells traditional cultural clothing and depends heavily on Instagram, TikTok and WhatsApp to reach customers, says she did not make any deliveries during the period. She tells the BBC that many of her customers ask for pictures before deciding on what to buy. "We could not send pictures, we could not receive orders, and we could not make deliveries," the businesswoman says. She adds that the effect of the shutdown was immediate, and made it difficult to cover basic costs. "We couldn't pay rent during that period," she says. "Even now, things have not fully recovered because customers still struggle to access us online." Journalist Ngabo Amon says his smartphone, a work tool for him, became largely useless. "You have a phone, but there is nothing to do with it," he tells the BBC. He could no longer research stories, follow election developments or send material to his newsroom. He says everyday life transformed into anxious stretches of waiting for the internet to be restored. Some households reverted to watching television to keep themselves occupied, either watching live, or buying downloaded old movies from shops. "People bought what they could afford, went back home and just watched, because there were no other options," Ngabo says. Some young people found it difficult to cope. Ronnie Mwesigwa, 20, says he lost contact with friends and had no access to online entertainment. "I couldn't communicate with anyone, and even gaming was gone," he says. "It was not a good situation." To pass his time, the gamer turned to content already stored on his phone, only viewing his gallery. "That was all I could do." Ngabo explains that the situation was especially frustrating for journalists covering the election, as the blackout made it impossible to get a real picture of what was unfolding on the ground. "You are talking about people rioting, about tension on the streets, but the audience is only seeing your photo and hearing your voice, and it is not satisfying for the journalist or the viewer," he points out. President Yoweri Museveni, 81, won the vote by a landslide to extend his 40-year-rule and has accused the opposition of seeking to overturn the results through violence. Bobi Wine, his closest challenger maintains the results are "fake" and has cited "ballot stuffing". According to a report by the African Union (AU) election observation mission, "the internet shutdown limited access to information, freedom of association [and] curtailed economic activities". It also notes that the shutdown "created suspicion and mistrust" in the election process. Ngabo says that the situation was worse in rural areas. With no internet access, some journalists were forced to physically transport their footage back to their newsrooms. He gives an example of videos, made early on the morning of the elections in a remote rural area, reaching Kampala by bus in the evening. "By that time, results are already being discussed and tallied and nobody is interested in the footage any more," he says. Caroline Mutai, a Kenya-based journalist who went to Uganda to cover the elections, says the shutdown "almost gave me depression". She describes the difficulties she faced trying to send back material to her newsroom, spending days searching for places with internet, only to be blocked or chased away. The shutdown also cut her off from family at a time of heightened insecurity. "When you are tired and stressed after work, you want to talk to people who are close to you," she says. "But you cannot reach them, and that makes the situation even harder." For students, the blackout disrupted both communication and learning. Aaron Benitez, a final-year school pupil, says he was unable to contact his family during a period of uncertainty. "I needed to know what was happening with my family and what was going on in the country," he tells the BBC. "But I could not connect with them at all." Online learning also came to a halt. Teachers could not send notes or assignments, and group discussions normally held online were cancelled. "Our master could not send notes on WhatsApp," the student says. "We usually study online, sometimes on Zoom, but during that time everything just stopped." He adds that access remains slow and unreliable, despite the election being over. "It is back, but it is still very slow. Some materials cannot load properly, and that affects our studies." The government partially restored the internet after Museveni was declared the winner on Saturday. Some platforms, especially social media, remain slow or restricted, pushing many young people to reconnect using a VPN (virtual private network), which can disguise its online location. For many, the shutdown was not just a temporary inconvenience but a stark reminder of how deeply digital access shapes their everyday life.

### 6. [Israeli strike in Gaza kills three journalists, first responders say](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c98pnzp50nqo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

Israeli strike in Gaza kills three journalists, first responders say Three Palestinian journalists have been killed in an Israeli strike in central Gaza, first responders say. Gaza's Hamas-run Civil Defence agency said their car was hit in the al-Zahra area and named them as Mohammed Salah Qashta, Anas Ghneim and Abdul Raouf Shaat. They are understood to have been working for an Egyptian relief organisation. The Israeli military said it struck "several suspects who operated a drone affiliated with Hamas... in a manner that posed a threat" to its troops. It added that the incident was under examination. Another eight people, two of them children, were killed by Israeli artillery and gunfire across Gaza on Wednesday, the Hamas-run health ministry said. Medics said three people, including a 10-year-old boy, were killed by Israeli tank fire elsewhere in central Gaza, and that a 13-year-old boy and a woman were killed by Israeli gunfire in the southern Khan Younis area, according to Reuters news agency. The Israeli military said on Wednesday morning that its troops had killed a "terrorist who crossed the Yellow Line and approached" them, without mentioning a location. The Yellow Line demarcates territory in Gaza still under Israeli control under the ceasefire deal. At least 466 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas began on 10 October, according to the health ministry. The Israeli military has said three of its soldiers have been killed in attacks by Palestinian armed groups over the same period. The three photojournalists killed on Wednesday were reportedly working for the Egyptian Relief Committee in the Gaza Strip to film its camps for displaced people. A spokesperson for the humanitarian organisation said the car that was struck was marked with its logo and that it was "targeted during a humanitarian mission, resulting in the martyrdom of three individuals". Hamas called the strike a "dangerous escalation of the flagrant violations of the ceasefire agreement". The Palestinian Journalists Syndicate said it constituted a war crime and evidence of what it called "a systematic Israeli policy aimed at silencing the Palestinian voice, obstructing the transmission of facts, and concealing crimes committed against civilians", according to Palestinian news agency Wafa. Abdul Raouf Shaat was regular contributor to French news agency AFP, which expressed "immense sadness" at his death and demanded a "full and transparent investigation". The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) also said it was "appalled". "Israel, which possesses advanced technology capable of identifying its targets, has an obligation under international law to protect journalists," regional director Sara Qudah said. The CPJ has documented the killing of at least 206 journalists and media workers by Israeli fire in Gaza since the start of the war - the deadliest conflict for journalists ever documented. Before Wednesday, two journalists had been killed in Israeli strikes during the ceasefire, and a third had been killed by members of a Palestinian armed group, according to the US-based organisation's data. International news outlets, including the BBC, rely on local journalists in Gaza, as Israel does not allow them to send foreign journalists into the territory independently. Some journalists are taken into Gaza by the Israeli military under controlled access. The war was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. Israel responded to the attack by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 71,550 people have been killed, according to the territory's health ministry.

**Excerpt**

Oldest cave painting of red claw hand could rewrite human creativity timeline A stencilled outline of a hand found on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi is the world's oldest known cave painting, researchers say. It shows a red outline of a hand whose fingers were reworked, researchers say, to create a claw-like motif which indicates an early leap in symbolic imagination. The painting has been dated to at least 67,800 years ago – around 1,100 years before the previous record, a controversial hand stencil in Spain. The find also strengthens the argument that our species, Homo sapiens, had reached the wider Australia–New Guinea landmass, known as Sahul, by around 15,000 years earlier than some researchers argue. Over the past decade, a series of discoveries on Sulawesi has overturned the old idea that art and abstract thinking in our species burst suddenly into life in Ice Age Europe and spread from there. Cave art is seen as a key marker of when humans began to think in truly abstract, symbolic ways – the kind of imagination that underpins language, religion and science. Early paintings and engravings show people not just reacting to the world, but representing it, sharing stories and identities in a way no other species is known to have done. Professor Adam Brumm of Griffiths University in Australia, who co-led the project, told BBC News, that the latest discovery, published in the journal Nature, adds to the emerging view that there was no awakening for humanity in Europe. Instead, creativity was innate to our species, the evidence for which stretches back to Africa, where we evolved. "When I went to university in the mid to late 90s, that's what we were taught – the creative explosion in humans occurred in a small part of Europe. But now we're seeing traits of modern human behaviour, including narrative art in Indonesia, which makes that Eurocentric argument very hard to sustain". The oldest Spanish cave art is a red hand stencil in Maltravieso cave in Western Spain, dated to be at least 66,700 years old - though this is controversial and some experts don't think it to be that old. In 2014, hand stencils and animal figures dating back at least 40,000 years were found in Sulawesi, followed by a hunting scene that is at least 44,000 year old, and then a narrative pig and human painting dated to at least 51,200 years ago. Each step pushed sophisticated image making further back in time, according to Professor Maxime Aubert of Griffiths University. "We started with minimum ages of at least 40,000 years, the same time as in Europe, but by getting closer to the pigment we've pushed the rock art in Sulawesi back by at least another 28,000 years". The latest discovery is from a limestone cave called Liang Metanduno on Muna, a small island off south eastern Sulawesi. It has been spray-painted: an ancient graffiti artist pressed their hand flat against the cave wall, then blew or spat a mouthful of pigment around it so that, when they pulled the hand away, a negative outline was left behind on the rock. One fragmentary hand stencil there is overlain by thin mineral crusts that, when analysed, was found to have a minimum age of 67,800 years, making it the oldest reliably dated cave art anywhere in the world. Crucially, the artist did more than simply spray pigment around a hand pressed to the wall, the researchers say. After the original stencil was made, the outlines of the fingers were carefully altered – narrowed and elongated to make it look more claw-like; a creative transformation that Brumm argues is "a very us thing to do". He notes that there was no evidence of that experimentation in any of the art produced by our sister species, Neanderthals, in their cave paintings in Spain around 64,000 years ago. Even that is hotly contested because some researchers question the dating method. Until this latest discovery on Muna, all the paintings in Sulawesi had come from the Maros Pangkep karst in the island's south west. The fact that this much older stencil turns up on the opposite side of Sulawesi, on a separate satellite island, suggests that making images on cave walls was not a local experiment but deeply embedded in the cultures that spread across the region. Brumm says years of fieldwork by Indonesian colleagues have revealed "hundreds of new rock art sites" across remote areas, with some caves used repeatedly over tens of thousands of years. At Liang Metanduno, other, much younger paintings on the same panel – some produced as late as about 20,000 years ago – show that this single cave was a focus for artistic activity stretching over at least 35,000 years. Because Sulawesi lies on the northern sea route between mainland Asia and ancient Sahul, the dates have direct implications for assessing when the ancestors of Aboriginal Australians first arrived. For years, the mainstream view – based largely on DNA studies and most archaeological sites – was that Homo sapiens first reached the ancient Australia–New Guinea landmass, Sahul, about 50,000 years ago. But with firm evidence that Homo sapiens were settled on Sulawesi and making complex symbolic art at least 67,800 years ago, it makes it much more likely that controversial archaeological evidence for humans in northern Australia by about 65,000 years is correct, according to Adhi Agus Oktaviana, of the Indonesia's national research and innovation Agency (BRIN). "It is very likely that the people who made these paintings in Sulawesi were part of the broader population that would later spread through the region and ultimately reach Australia." Many archaeologists once argued for a European "big bang" of the mind because cave paintings, carvings, ornaments and new stone tools all seem to appear together in France and Spain about 40,000 years ago, soon after Homo sapiens arrived there. Spectacular Ice Age cave art in places like Altamira and El Castillo encouraged the idea that symbolism and art switched on almost overnight in Ice Age Europe. Since then, engraved ochre, beads and abstract marks from South African sites such as Blombos Cave, some 70,000–100,000 years old, have shown that symbolic behaviour was already established in Africa long before. Along with very old figurative and narrative paintings from Sulawesi, a new consensus is being shaped; that there was a much deeper and more widespread story of creativity, Aubert told BBC News. "What it suggests is that humans would have had that capacity for a very long time, at least when they left Africa – but probably before that".

### 8. [Could US Congress stop Trump from taking over Greenland?](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c701rvrpjwko?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

Could US Congress stop Trump from taking over Greenland? President Donald Trump's push to acquire Greenland has sparked a backlash from Republicans in Congress, as lawmakers voice growing concern about US military interventions overseas. But it remains unclear if enough Republicans are willing to join Democrats to block a takeover of the island territory - and whether Trump would bow to pressure from Congress, or act alone as he's done several times in a second term marked by growing American entanglements abroad. The focus on Greenland has grown into a broader discussion over the Trump administration's unilateral use of military force, along with diplomatic and economic coercion, to project power in Venezuela, Iran and elsewhere around the world. Republicans have largely backed Trump's foreign policy agenda since he returned to the White House. But now, a growing number are siding with Democrats in Congress and Nato allies who say a takeover of Greenland would violate US and international law. In recent days, some Republican leaders have said there's little interest in the US buying Greenland or seizing it through military force. The White House had previously left the military option on the table but on Wednesday it was ruled out by Trump in his speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Some Republican lawmakers have also joined Democrats in opposing a new plan by Trump to place tariffs on countries that don't back his bid to acquire the territory, which is self-governed but controlled by Denmark. The proposed tariffs would be "bad for America, bad for American businesses, and bad for America's allies," Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina wrote on social media, adding that the move would benefit China and Russia. "It's great for [Russian President Vladimir] Putin, [Chinese President] Xi [Jinping] and other adversaries who want to see Nato divided." Other Republicans said Trump's ambition to annex Greenland was threatening to undermine the Nato alliance - to which both the US and Denmark belong - in a moment of growing tension between the US and European allies. "Respect for the sovereignty of the people of Greenland should be non-negotiable," Senator Lisa Murkowski, the co-chair of the Senate Arctic Caucus, said in a statement. Trump has argued the US must own the territory to better compete with China and Russia in the Arctic, and has vowed to take it "one way or another". On Tuesday, the US president downplayed concerns that the issue was hurting Nato when asked by the BBC if he was willing to see the decades-old security alliance collapse as a consequence of his push for the territory. Trump reiterated his view that ownership of Greenland was critical for US and global security. "We need [Greenland] for national security and even world security," he said. But Trump's insistence on obtaining the territory is increasingly unpopular on Capitol Hill, as more Republicans have come forward to break ranks publicly. Representative Don Bacon of Nebraska, a Trump critic, said Trump's push for Greenland could lead to an impeachment investigation. And the Republican leaders in each chamber of Congress, Senate Majority Leader John Thune and House Speaker Mike Johnson, said they opposed a military intervention in Greenland, when Trump was refusing to rule that out. Other Republicans have voiced support for Trump. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas said on Sunday that it was "overwhelmingly in America's national interest" to own Greenland. "When it comes to Greenland, I want to commend President Trump, for being single-mindedly focused on America First, on US economic interests, and US national security interests," Cruz said in a Fox News interview. Congress has some options to try to rein Trump in, if Republicans and Democrats do choose to pick a fight with the president over Greenland. Congress has the power of the purse and in theory would have to approve funding used to buy Greenland, experts said. Denmark and Greenland have both insisted the island isn't for sale. "If Trump wants to buy Greenland it would require an act of Congress to provide the funds to do so," said Daniel Schuman, the executive director of the American Governance Institute and an expert on congressional procedure. It's unlikely that Congress could repurpose existing funding to buy the territory, Schuman added. Still, the administration has expanded the use of executive power to enact Trump's immigration and tariff agenda, among other issues. The administration might try to claim some new authority to seize Greenland that would allow it to overrule any roadblocks by Congress, Schuman said. Lawmakers worried about a military incursion in Greenland have signalled support for measures prohibiting any US action without congressional approval. But it's unclear if the proposals have enough Republican support to pass in either chamber of Congress. Five Senate Republicans joined Democrats earlier this month to advance a bill that would have blocked the administration from taking further military action in Venezuela, following the attack in December that deposed former President Nicolás Maduro. The Venezuela war powers resolution ultimately failed to get through the Senate. But it signalled mounting frustration from Republican and Democratic lawmakers with Trump's use of military force abroad, after he ran in 2024 on a promise to reduce US involvement in foreign conflicts. Last week a bipartisan congressional delegation visited Denmark in a symbolic show of support for Greenland. It's also unclear how the Senate, which ratifies treaties, would respond if the US reached some sort of agreement with Denmark to take over part or all of Greenland. The US has an existing arrangement with Denmark established in 1951 that allows the US to expand its military presence in Greenland. Murkowski and other Republicans have argued that the US doesn't need to take over the territory to address national security needs in the region. The Senate could try to thwart Trump by opposing a treaty between the US and Denmark, in the event the two nations reach an agreement. Treaties require two-thirds support in the Senate for ratification, which Republicans currently fall well short of. Some Republicans have already indicated that they'd consider breaking with Trump over Greenland. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the former majority leader in the upper chamber of Congress, told reporters that a US takeover of the territory would "shatter the trust of allies". Faced with growing Republican concern over Greenland, Trump could look to strike a deal that falls short of a formal treaty and doesn't require Senate approval. But it's unclear if presidents have the authority to make such agreements without input from Congress, analysts said. "Plenty of international agreements are concluded in forms other than treaties," said Josh Chafetz, a professor at Georgetown Law, but "I'm sceptical that something of this magnitude could be concluded as a pure executive agreement." Trump did not say on Tuesday whether he believed he was constrained by anything in his pursuit of Greenland. Asked how far he was willing to go, Trump told reporters to stay tuned. "I think something is going to happen that's going to be very good for everybody," Trump said. Additional reporting by Kayla Epstein

Loved ones of victims reeling after high-speed rail crash in southern Spain Eduardo Morán, a doctor at Córdoba's Reina Sofía Hospital, suspected it was serious. He and his wife, also a medic, had been asked to head to work after reports that two high speed trains had collided nearby. "We were preparing different parts of the hospital," he recalls. "Not just the emergency room, but the intensive care unit, all the surgery theatres and the regular floor. Everybody was there." As the patients arrived, their injuries ranged from scratches to missing limbs. Staff prioritised who to treat. Some were operated on, others monitored. Eduardo had never seen such an influx of casualties in his 20-year career, and yet the hospital was not overwhelmed. "We were expecting more," he says. "Unfortunately, there were a lot of people who didn't make it and died on the railway." In dense woodland 36 miles from Córdoba lies the tangled wreckage of the two trains that collided on Sunday evening. A gap in the straight section of track is thought to be what investigators are focusing on. At least 43 people lost their lives here, and as sniffer dogs weave between the empty seats and shattered windows, there is still a hunger to unearth answers as to what caused Spain's worst rail crash in more than a decade. As officials called for patience, news broke of a second derailment in almost as many days. Unlike Sunday night's disaster, the train that crashed near Barcelona was not a high-speed model, and the accident involved a wall that collapsed onto the track in heavy rain. Nevertheless, it has led to the Spanish train drivers' union calling a strike over the "unacceptable constant deterioration of the railway". For the families and friends of those missing and killed in southern Spain, these events have only added to their unanswered questions. Throughout Saturday afternoon and into the night in Córdoba, Jose Manuel Muñoz and his friends were holding a surprise 50th birthday party for María del Carmen Abril, a teacher. The party was barely over when Abril, as she is known, made her way back north to Madrid. She thanked her hosts on their WhatsApp group, and they later frantically replied to see if she was OK. Abril was sitting on one of the carriages that came off the tracks into an oncoming train. Her death was confirmed the next day. "It's very difficult to explain the contrast of emotions," says Muñoz, sitting in the tranquil surroundings of Córdoba's Jardines de la Victoria, a park next to his workshop where he makes picture frames. "We spent one day celebrating life with our friend, then there were two days of uncertainty, without knowing anything about what happened to her, then we get the confirmation that she's dead." He describes Abril as a "lovely, generous, affectionate person who loved flowers and was always trying to solve other people's problems". And yet Muñoz does not blame anyone for her death; instead, he puts it down to bad luck. Under the low winter sun and next to the city's bull ring is Córdoba's Civic Centre. Outside are two makeshift tents where the families of the missing give DNA samples in the hope their relatives can at least be identified. Because of a last-minute change in travel plans, Jamilet's brother-in law, Victor Luis Terán, took an earlier train and became caught up in the crash as he travelled south from Madrid to Huelva. It was not until Tuesday night that confirmation came that Victor, a Bolivian national, was among the 43 victims. Yamilei is looking for answers: "That's all we want. Because we can't do it any more." The truth she seeks is likely to take weeks to arrive, and official calls for patience have only been hampered by a devastating three days on Spain's rail network.

Beckham v Peltz Beckham: Could Brooklyn torpedo the family brand? Sir David and Lady Beckham's son Brooklyn has accused them of putting "Brand Beckham" first as they built up their global image and business empire. His bombshell statement threatens to derail both their public reputation and their private life. "We've tried to give our children the most normal upbringing as possible," David said in his 2023 Netflix documentary, as Brooklyn was shown checking up on his cooking. "But you've got a dad that was England captain and a mum that was Posh Spice." David went on to say how proud he was, and "so in awe of my children and the way they've turned out" - making the point that his family had withstood the pressures of fame. In hindsight, the clip feels more like a warning about how difficult that is. And while David's sentiments were surely genuine, viewers might also question how much has been said and done for the benefit of the cameras. 'The non-royal royal family' That documentary, and the subsequent series about Victoria, were both made by the Beckhams' own production company, meaning they were ultimately in control of what story was being told. That's part of a strategy that has seen them remain famously protective of their public image as they have grown their global fame and an empire worth an estimated £500m. As well as being perhaps the ultimate celebrity power couple, Victoria has built a career as a fashion designer, and David has business interests ranging from clothing to health supplements. The brand got perhaps the ultimate accolade when David was knighted by the King last year. "They are the non-royal royal family of our celebrity culture, and people have been invested in them and their dynastic branding for the last 25 years or more," says entertainment journalist Caroline Frost. But their documentaries, social feeds and interviews reveal a carefully curated version of their family life. And they stay firmly on message whenever the Beckhams are riding out any scandals and storms, of which there have been a few - from his alleged affairs, to embarrassing leaked emails about not being knighted sooner, to controversy about his role as an ambassador for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. The biggest threat to the Beckhams' family brand could now come from their eldest child, whose explosive post "has ruptured it from within", Frost told BBC Radio 5 Live. After months of rumours about a rift, 26-year-old Brooklyn Peltz Beckham claimed his family "values public promotion and endorsements above all else", and that brand protection went too far. "Brand Beckham comes first," he wrote. "Family 'love' is decided by how much you post on social media, or how quickly you drop everything to show up and pose for a family photo opp, even if it's at the expense of our professional obligations." He also posted: "For my entire life, my parents have controlled narratives in the press about our family. The performative social media posts, family events and inauthentic relationships have been a fixture of the life I was born into." David and Victoria haven't directly responded to Brooklyn's public grievances. The Beckhams have been "incredibly talented at controlling their own narrative publicly", and the brand has strong foundations, according to celebrity crisis PR Lauren Beeching. "The Beckham name operates as commercial architecture, not just a surname at this point, and I would say that architecture is extremely strong. "The Beckhams have decades of goodwill, global recognition and a fan base that spans generations, and also their recent Netflix documentaries were massive global hits and reinforced that stable, emotionally controlled, likeable image of a family." However, the rift with Brooklyn will cause pain both personally and professionally, Beeching believes. "The Beckhams are very protective of their brand, so this will be incredibly stressful for them because it goes against everything they're trying to stand for, which is basically a united family front." Over the past 30 years, the Beckhams have navigated a media landscape that has morphed from a tabloid feeding frenzy into a social media free-for-all, so the instinct to protect their image is perhaps understandable. But some believe they are reaping the consequences of putting their family in the limelight to benefit the brand. The Guardian's Marina Hyde said Brooklyn had been "commodified" since before he was born, with his parents selling pictures and stories from as early as Victoria's pregnancy. But, Hyde added, his parents refined their media strategy as he grew older. "As time went on, David and Victoria acquired more sophisticated advisers who understood the rapidly morphing potential of controlling image and brand, and built a vast and diversified empire for them off the back of it." Others, however, suggest Brooklyn is spoiled, has taken advantage of the family name himself, and shouldn't post on social media about his desire for privacy. Tom Bower, author of 2024 biography The House of Beckham, sympathises with Brooklyn and isn't persuaded by the image his parents project. "The Beckhams are a phoney family," he told 5 Live. "It's a family for a brand, and it's been very successful... "And the truth is, they're not a happy family. They are a commercial product, which has earned them a fortune, but the victims have been their children." However, journalist Hadley Freeman, ghostwriter of Victoria Beckham's 2006 biography, says in her experience they were "both incredibly sweet, incredibly involved with their children, very loving as a family". "At the same time, there is this problem with some famous people, which is that they are addicted to their fame, and they are addicted to how people see them," she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. "It's not hard to imagine what it's like to be a relative within that situation and to feel maybe a little exploited at times, and to see the disparity between what is put on social media and the reality." Brooklyn has now joined another dynasty - his wife Nicola Peltz is the daughter of US billionaire businessman Nelson Peltz. He has embarked on his own career, with a photography book published in 2017, and his own line of hot sauce launched in 2024. But Brooklyn has struggled to build his own brand. "He's described as a nepo kid, benefiting from the Beckham name; a chef one minute, a photographer another minute, just bouncing around careers," says Beeching. "Fair or not, that is the reputation he's got right now. I'm sure they want to build their own power couple image. But I think the Beckhams have much sharper PR." Peltz has similarly embarked on her own career as an actress and director. But an in-law having Beckham in her surname means that David and Victoria no longer have full control of how the name is used. We may or may not find out much more about what's really going on behind the scenes. Going by past form, David and Victoria are likely to attempt to keep calm and carry on. "I think this is the biggest challenge yet," Frost says. "Of course, they'll carry on. They're the Beckhams. They're too rich to fail. They've got too many followings to fail. They've got fashion industries, they've got many legs holding that table up. But it's a huge challenge, that's for sure."
