What we know about Trump's 'framework of future deal' over Greenland US President Donald Trump has announced there is a "framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland". The statement came as a surprise after days of mounting tensions, culminating with a threat to impose economic sanctions on eight close US allies which have opposed his plans to seize the semi-autonomous territory of Denmark. So what could this deal entail and will it be acceptable to Denmark and Greenland - both of which have made it clear they will not relinquish sovereignty of the world's largest island in the Arctic? What has been said about the framework deal? President Trump made the announcement on his Truth Social media platform on Wednesday, after talks at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. "Based upon a very productive meeting that I have had with the Secretary General of NATO, Mark Rutte, we have formed the framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland," he said. He did not give details, but said talks would continue to reach the deal. Rutte, for his part, said he had not discussed the key issue of Danish sovereignty over Greenland in his meeting with Trump. The view in Denmark is that the issue is far from over and that any agreement must still be hammered out together between Greenland, Denmark and the US. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Danes could negotiate "on everything political; security, investments, economy". "But we cannot negotiate on our sovereignty. I have been informed that this has not been the case either," she said in a statement on Thursday. One of two Greenlandic lawmakers in the Danish parliament, Aaja Chenmitz, said: "Nato in no case has the right to negotiate on anything without us, Greenland. Nothing about us without us". The UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said she hoped this meant that there would be "the direct discussions that Denmark had asked for, for Denmark, Greenland and the United States on the way forward around Greenland, protecting Greenland's sovereignty". Is there any detail about the possible deal? The Danish and Greenlandic reiteration that sovereignty is non-negotiable appears to be aimed at rejecting reports in the New York Times, where anonymous officials said one idea under discussion was for Denmark to cede sovereignty over small areas of Greenland where the US would build military bases. This arrangement would be similar to the status of two military bases in Cyprus, which are controlled by the UK. Akrotiri and Dhekelia have been under UK sovereignty since Cyprus became independent in 1960. That treaty has been modified since, but essentially it is considered British territory. Yvette Cooper did not confirm whether she knew what the framework agreement contained, but mentioned "some very practical discussions about Greenland's security, whilst being very, very clear that Greenland sovereignty is not up for negotiation". In arguing in favour of seizing Greenland, Trump has mentioned the threat of Chinese and Russian vessels around the island, even though Denmark says there is no threat "today". On this point, Nato allies have tried to reassure the US that they will boost security in the Arctic and Mark Rutte told the Reuters news agency on Thursday that the framework deal would also require this contribution. "I have no doubt we can do this quite fast. Certainly I would hope for 2026, I hope even early in 2026." One of the ideas the UK has been calling for is to set up an Arctic Sentry, said Yvette Cooper on Thursday, which was a "very similar to the approach that Nato has taken to the Baltic sentry" - a mission to increase the surveillance of ships in the Baltic Sea after critical undersea cables were severed. Will any deal short of 'ownership' please Trump? The US has had a military presence in Greenland since after World War Two. Under a 1951 agreement with Denmark, the US can bring as many troops as it wants to Greenland. It already has more than 100 military personnel permanently stationed at its Pituffik base in the north-western tip of the territory. So discussions to reach a deal may centre on a renegotiation of that agreement, according to US officials. The US does have military bases in many countries - including Germany - but they do not constitute sovereign territory. Trump has insisted a lease agreement over Greenland is not good enough. "Countries have to have ownership and you defend ownership, you don't defend leases. And we'll have to defend Greenland," he said two weeks ago. In order to acquire the island, he has threatened to use force - until a U-turn in Davos where he dropped that threat to the relief of his Nato allies. Nato was founded in 1949 on the principle that an attack on one ally is an attack on all. These attacks were meant to come from outside, and Denmark had made it clear a military attack would spell the end of the trans-Atlantic alliance, where the US is the major partner. The Nato secretary-general has been criticised for the praise he has constantly showered on President Trump - at one point calling him "daddy". "You can always take Donald Trump at his word. That is why I really think we are very glad to have him," Rutte said on Thursday. The Danish prime minister said she had been in constant contact with Rutte before and after Trump's announcement. But it is not clear what - if any - Danish input led to the latest climbdown by Trump. Why does Trump want Greenland? Trump has sought to buy Greenland off Denmark since his first time in office - and he is not the only US president to try to do so. Trump says the US needs Greenland to protect against possible attacks from Russia and China. He has also said Greenland is essential for his plan to build a Golden Dome defence system, designed to protect the US against missile attacks, and that European allies could co-operate in this endeavour. Along with Greenland's strategic location, the US has spoken about the island's vast - and largely untapped - reserves of rare earth minerals, many of which are crucial for technologies including mobile phones and electric vehicles. Trump has not said the US is after Greenland's riches, but that a US control over the island "puts everybody in a really good position, especially as it pertains to security and to minerals". "It's a deal that's forever."

Two dead and several missing in New Zealand landslides Two people have died and several are feared buried after landslides in New Zealand's North Island. The deaths were reported at Welcome Bay, while rescue workers are still searching through rubble at a different site in a popular campground on Mount Maunganui. There are no "signs of life", authorities said, adding that they have a "rough idea" of how many people are missing but are waiting for an exact figure. They provided no other details except that the group includes "at least one young girl". The landslides were triggered by heavy rains over the last few days, which led to flooding and power outages across the North Island. One minister said the east coast resembled "a war zone". New Zealand is "heavy with grief" after the "profound tragedy" caused by recent weather, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said on X. Footage from the campsite on Mount Maunganui, an extinct volcano, shows a huge slip near the base of the volcanic dome, as rescuers and sniffer dogs comb through crushed caravans and flattened tents. Authorities said that the search would continue through the night. "This is a complex and high-risk environment, and our teams are working to achieve the best possible outcome while keeping everyone safe," said Megan Stiffler, the deputy national commander for the Urban Search and Rescue team, The extinct volcano is a sacred Māori site and one of the most popular campgrounds in New Zealand, with a local holiday website describing it as a "slice of paradise". But it has been repeatedly hit by landslides in recent years. "I heard this huge tree crack and all this dirt come off, and then I looked behind me and there's this huge landslide coming down," Australian tourist Sonny Worrall told local broadcaster TVNZ. "I'm still shaking from it now... I turned around and had to jump out of my seat and just run,"he added. He saw it happen while swimming in a hot pool. Hiker Mark Tangney told the New Zealand Herald he heard people screaming from under the rubble. "So I just parked up and ran to help... We could hear people screaming: 'Help us, help us, get us out of here'," he said. Those calls persisted for about half an hour and then went silent, Tangney said. A surf club in another part of Mount Maunganui has been evacuated following fears of more landslides. A state of emergency has been declared in the Bay of Plenty where Mount Maunganui sits, and various parts of the North Island, including Northland, Coromandel, Tairāwhiti and Hauraki. Several areas reported their wettest days on record on Thursday. Tauranga in the Bay of Plenty, for example, received three months worth of rain within a day, according to local media. Some 8,000 people were without power as of Thursday morning, Radio New Zealand (RNZ) reported. The wife of a man who was swept away in the Mahurangi River is holding out hope that he will survive. "I know his personality is strong, wise," she told RNZ, adding that he was a fisherman back home in Kiribati and knew how to swim and dive. The man, 47, was driving to work with their nephew when the car they were in fell into the river. He had pushed the nephew towards a branch so the nephew could hoist himself onto land; but the older man did not manage get back up himself, according to the report. "It's been a very big event for us as a country, really hitting almost our entire eastern seaboard of the North Island," said Minister for Emergency Management Mark Mitchell. "The good news is that everyone responded really quickly, and there was time to get prepared. That helps to mitigate and create a very strong response," he told RNZ. December to February are typically the sunnier months in New Zealand but in recent years heavy rains and storms have become more frequent. In February 2023, parts of the island were devastated by Cyclone Gabrielle, which is to date the costliest cyclone to hit the Southern Hemisphere, with damage amounting to NZ$13.5bn ($7.9bn; £5.9bn). This week's flooding has added to the toll for the local communities that are still rebuilding. Additional reporting by Vandhna Bhan and Koh Ewe

**Excerpt**

Rapid rollback of Kurdish-led forces reshapes Sharaa's Syria President Ahmed al-Sharaa has made significant advances in his efforts to unify a deeply fractured Syria, reclaiming large swathes of territory in the north-east that had been under the control of a Kurdish-led militia alliance for more than a decade. What happens next will be a test for a government that has tried to assert its authority over the whole country. The gains by government forces in a lightning offensive against the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) marked the biggest change of control in Syria since Islamist-led rebels toppled Bashar al-Assad in December 2024, ending the 13-year civil war. Before this month's push, nearly a third of Syria's territory was controlled by the Kurds, who enjoyed American support after helping a US-led coalition defeat the jihadist group Islamic State (IS) in the last decade. There, they ran an enclave with its own government and institutions, with the SDF being its military arm. The offensive came amid stalled talks between Sharaa's government and the SDF about the key issue of integrating its forces into the country's institutions. A deal was signed last March, but a year-end deadline expired with little progress as the SDF remained reluctant to give up its autonomy. The militia alliance, analysts say, miscalculated in its negotiations with the government, seeming to believe it would have the backing of its longtime ally. But the US under President Donald Trump has strongly supported Sharaa, who has defended his vision of a united Syria under the control of Damascus. Trump hosted Sharaa, who was once branded a terrorist by the US for his former links to al-Qaeda, at the White House last year, and lifted devastating sanctions imposed on Syria in the Assad years. When Sharaa's forces started their push, there was no apparent US objection. On Sunday, after suffering stunning territorial losses, the SDF agreed on a 14-point deal that reversed almost all concessions it had gained from the government in earlier negotiations. Crucially, its members are expected to join the Syrian army and interior ministry as individuals - and not as separate units, as it had demanded - while the control of oil and gas fields, important for Syria's economic recovery, will be transferred to the government. SDF-run prisons and camps holding thousands of IS detainees and family members are also being brought under Damascus' control. The announcement came days after Sharaa issued a decree that was seen as an attempt to reach out to the Kurds, whose rights had been denied in the five-decade rule by the Assads: it designated Kurdish as a national language, granted Syrian nationality to stateless Kurds, and declared the Nowruz - the Persian new year - a national holiday. Fighting, however, erupted again. So far, the areas reclaimed by government forces have been mainly Arab, where locals had resentments against the SDF. But the troops continued to move towards Kurdish-majority areas, raising the prospect of deadly clashes, and reportedly angering Washington. On Tuesday, Sharaa's government suddenly announced a ceasefire, giving the SDF four days to present a detailed plan for the integration of areas under its control into the state. This halted the move of his army and prevented the escalation of the violence, for now. Since coming to power after the fall of the Assad regime, Sharaa has repeatedly vowed to protect Syria's minorities. But the country has seen deadly bouts of sectarian violence. Last year, government forces were accused of atrocities after being sent to the Mediterranean coast, which is the heartland of Assad's Alawite sect, and the mainly Druze southern province of Suweida. Kurds fear the same could happen to them, despite renewed guarantees offered by Sharaa. For the Kurds, the losses are a fatal blow to the aspirations of preserving their autonomy, with the US position being seen as a betrayal. Tom Barrack, the US special envoy, said the "original purpose" of the partnership with the SDF, as the main anti-IS force in Syria, had "largely expired", and that the "greatest opportunity for the Kurds in Syria" lay in the transition under Sharaa, whose government is seen by Western countries as the best chance to guarantee Syria's stability. The dramatic changes empower Sharaa but are likely to renew calls for him to decentralise authority, with critics saying key posts have been limited to his allies. It could also indicate what he may be planning to do in other areas of the country, including those held by the Druze, who demand autonomy.

Son-in-law of Venezuelan opposition candidate freed from jail, wife says Rafael Tudares, the son-in-law of Venezuelan opposition candidate Edmundo González, has been released from prison, his wife has said, more than a year after he was detained as part of a crackdown on Maduro government critics and their relatives. Mariana González said her husband had returned home after "380 days of unjust and arbitrary detention". Tudares is one of more than 150 detainees who have been released since the US military seized Venezuelan leader, Nicolás Maduro, in a nighttime raid and took him to New York to stand trial on drug-trafficking charges. An NGO lobbying for the release of Venezuelan political prisoners warns that 777 still remain behind bars. Tension within the country remains high with Maduro's former vice-president, Delcy Rodríguez, now in power having been sworn in as the acting president. Her interim government has received the backing of US President Donald Trump, who has praised Rodríguez for agreeing to "turn over" up to 50 million barrels of Venezuelan oil to the US. The release of political prisoners had been among the first things the Trump administration had pushed Venezuela's interim government to do. Just five days after the US raid, the head of Venezuela's National Assembly announced that "an important number of people" would be freed as "a gesture of peace". However, rights groups have denounced the slow pace of the releases and the fact that the number given by officials - 400 - falls far short of what they have been able to confirm. The NGO Foro Penal says it has so far only been able to verify the release of 151 political prisoners since 8 January, when the head of Venezuela's National Assembly announced that "an important number of people" would be freed as "a gesture of peace" following the US operation. Foro Penal has also said that many those released have not had the charges against them dropped, leaving them in legal limbo, and have been barred from speaking in public. Tudares's imprisonment was one of the emblematic cases of the repression which followed in the wake of Venezuela's 2024 presidential election. His father-in-law, González, became the main challenger of the incumbent Maduro after the well-known opposition leader María Corina Machado was barred from running. Fearing the Maduro government would resort to fraud to rig the result, González and Machado mobilised hundreds of people to act as observers at the polling stations and collect the tallies from the electronic voting machines. The electoral council, dominated by government loyalists, declared Maduro the winner but never provided the detailed voting tallies to back up its claim. The voting tallies collected by the observers deployed by the opposition and independently verified by the Carter Center, however, suggested that González had won by a landslide. Nevertheless, Maduro - who was firmly in control of the state institutions, including the armed forces and the police - was sworn in for another term in January 2025. In the run-up to his inauguration, many opposition leaders and activists were seized by the security forces in an attempt to stifle any dissent. Fearing arrest, González had sought refuge in the Dutch embassy as early as September 2024 and gone in to exile in Spain shortly afterwards. Three days before Maduro's inauguration, González's 46-year-old son-in-law - a lawyer who was not involved in politics - was seized by hooded men as he was taking his young children to see their ailing grandmother. For months, his family did not know where he was being held or on what grounds he had been seized. Last month, his wife said she had learned that he had been sentenced to 30 years in prison for "terrorism and conspiracy". She said her access was not allowed to choose a lawyer and had only been allowed to read the charges levelled against him on the day of his "only hearing". Mariana González told El Pais newspaper that she had been approached on at least three occasions by middlemen who told her that her husband would only be allowed to return to his family if her father renounced his cause. "This has nothing to do with justice," she said at the time. "Being the son-in-law of Edmundo González is not a crime," she added. Mariana González took to X to thank all of the people who had supported her in her fight for her husband's release. But she also reminded readers that there were still many families waiting for the release of their loved ones who, she said, had been "forcibly disappeared, arbitrarily detained and unjustly locked up. Many of them have been holding vigils outside the main prisons in Venezuela in the hope that their relatives will be among those released in the wake of the US military raid.

EU suspends approval of US trade deal The European Parliament has suspended the approval of a key US trade deal agreed in July in protest against Donald Trump's demand to take over Greenland. The suspension was announced in Strasbourg, France, on Wednesday, as the US president addressed the World Economic Forum in Davos. The move followed renewed trade tensions between the US and Europe sparked by Trump's bid to acquire Greenland, which had rattled financial markets, reviving talk of a trade war and the possibility of retaliation against the US. Hours later, Trump said on social media he had reached a "framework" deal on Greenland's future and would not carry out threats to put new tariffs on eight Nato members. Trade tensions between the US and Europe had eased since the two sides struck a deal at Trump's Turnberry golf course in Scotland in July. That agreement set US levies on most European goods at 15%, down from the 30% Trump had initially threatened as part of his "Liberation Day" wave of tariffs in April. In exchange, Europe had agreed to invest in the US and make changes on the continent expected to boost US exports. The deal would have still required approval from the European Parliament to become official. But on Wednesday, days after Trump threatened fresh US tariffs over Greenland, Bernd Lange, chair of the European Parliament's International Trade Committee, said it was "left with no alternative but to suspend work on the two Turnberry legislative proposals". He said work to implement the trade plans would be on hold "until the US decides to re-engage on a path of cooperation rather than confrontation, and before any further steps are taken". The move renewed the possibility that the EU might move forward with tariffs on a possible €93bn ($109bn, £81bn) worth of American goods it announced last year in response to Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs. It had put those plans on hold while the trade deal was being finalised but those levies would now come into force on 7 February unless the bloc moves to extend the pause or approves the new deal. Lange, speaking before Trump announced the "framework deal" and backed off the tariff threat, said there would be "no possibility for compromise" until Trump's threats ended. He also raised the prospect of the use of the "anti-coercion instrument" of retaliatory measures, nicknamed a "trade bazooka", an idea also backed by French President Emmanuel Macron. In an interview with the BBC after Trump's announcement, Lange declined to say whether it could salvage the trade deal, adding that it would take "some time" to understand its implications. "We have to look what this so-called solution would mean," he said. There seems to be a sense in Brussels that Trump's climbdown was inevitable. When BBC News asked one well placed EU source for a response to President Trump saying he wouldn't go ahead with the tariffs, the response was simply an eye-rolling emoji. Over the last year, financial markets have batted away concerns over the impact of the US president's policy announcements, taking comfort in the TACO acronym, Trump Always Chickens Out. It seems the sense of him not following through on threats has also taken hold in some corridors of power. In his Davos speech, Trump repeated his interest in the US acquiring Greenland from Denmark, but said "I don't have to use force, I don't want to use force, I won't use force". He called for "immediate negotiations" with the country about how he could take over the island, which he has argued is crucial for US and global security, announcing the "framework" of a future deal a few hours later. Trump's speech helped to calm financial markets on both sides of the Atlantic, which had sunk in previous days. Shares in the US gained further on the deal announcement, with the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, rising more than 1% in afternoon trading on Wednesday, while the FTSE 100 closed slightly higher. The price of gold continued to make gains as it rose above $4,842 (£3,604) an ounce for the first time. The price of silver remained slightly lower than Monday's record high of $95 an ounce, hovering around $94. Precious metals are seen as safer assets to hold in times of uncertainty, and the prices of both gold and silver have soared over the past year. The US and the 27-nation European Union are each others' single biggest trade partners, with more than €1.6tn ($1.9tn, £1.4tn) in goods and services exchanged in 2024, according to European figures. That represents nearly a third of all global trade. When Trump started announcing tariffs last year, it prompted threats of retaliation from many political leaders, including in Europe. In the end, however, many, opted to negotiate instead. Only China and Canada stuck by their threats to hit American goods with tariffs, with Canada quietly withdrawing most of those measures in September, concerned they were damaging the Canadian economy. In a speech in Davos on Tuesday, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney urged "middle powers" to unite to push back against the might-makes-right world of great power rivalry that he warned was emerging. "When we only negotiate bilaterally with a hegemon, we negotiate from weakness. We accept what is offered. We compete with each other to be the most accommodating," he warned. "This is not sovereignty. It is the performance of sovereignty while accepting subordination." The US has previously expressed impatience with European progress toward approval of the deal amid ongoing disagreements over tech and metals tariffs. But ahead of Trump's arrival in Davos, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said European leaders should not jump to retaliate, urging them to "have an open mind". "I tell everyone, sit back. Take a deep breath. Do not retaliate," he said. Looming in the background of the trade tensions is a pending Supreme Court decision over whether many of the tariffs Trump announced last year are legal.

Ugandan MP and Bobi Wine ally arrested over election violence Ugandan police have detained a lawmaker, and close ally of opposition leader Bobi Wine, for his alleged role in election-related violence last week. Muwanga Kivumbi, a deputy leader of Wine's National Unity Platform (NUP), is accused of organising attacks on a police station and a vote-tallying centre after their electoral loss, which the party denies. The police have said that seven people were killed in the incident, but the politician has given a different account, saying that 10 people were killed at his home as they waited for parliamentary election results. The Uganda Police Force said in a post on X on Thursday that Kivumbi would be "arraigned before court in due course". "His arrest is in connection with recent incidents of political violence," it added. Kivumbi's arrest follows tensions after last week's elections in which President Yoweri Museveni was re-elected for a seventh term. During his victory speech over the weekend, Museveni warned opposition figures including Kivumbi of coordinated plans to attack polling stations. He said seven people were shot dead by police after groups of alleged opposition supporters, armed with machetes, attempted to carry out violent attacks in Butambala district outside the capital, Kampala. Wine, Museveni's closest challenger and who is in hiding after fleeing a raid on his house after the elections, has denounced the results as "fake", citing electoral fraud. He has also alleged that there was "silent massacre" under way and a crackdown targeting political activists. On Tuesday, he posted on social media that more than 100 people had been killed in election violence, without stating evidence. This came after Uganda's army chief Gen Muhoozi Kainerugaba, who is also Museveni's son and his potential successor, said the security forces had killed 22 opposition supporters during poll-related violence. Since the election, Ugandan authorities have reportedly arrested dozens of youths on various charges linked to election-related incidents in Kampala. Museveni first came to power as a rebel leader in 1986. He will have served for 45 years when the next term ends in 2031. Uganda has not witnessed a peaceful transfer of presidential power since independence. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

**Excerpt**

South African police not yet able to defeat gangs, minister says South Africa's Police Minister Firoz Cachalia has said that the security forces are not yet able to defeat deadly criminal gangs, in a stark admission that underscores the scale of the country's crime crisis. Gang violence, alongside robberies, accounts for many murders in South Africa, which has one of the world's highest homicide rates. Cachalia said gang violence had become increasingly complex, especially in the Eastern Cape and Western Cape provinces, requiring new strategies beyond traditional policing. "I do not believe that we are currently in a position to defeat these gangs," the minister told journalists on Wednesday. South Africa, the continent's most industrialised nation, has long struggled with entrenched organised crime. Many people in South Africa own licensed firearms for personal protection, but there are many more illegal guns in circulation. Police data shows that an average of 63 people were killed each day between April and September last year. Speaking after his visit to crime-infested Nelson Mandela Bay in Eastern Cape, Cachalia said criminal gangs were on a "killing spree" in the two provinces. "We had a discussion about the problem of organised crime in the Eastern Cape, including extortion rackets, gang violence and related issues," said the minister. "I indicated that this is a grave problem throughout the country, that these cartels wield significant wealth and power, and that this is deeply concerning," he added. Despite the creation of an anti-gang unit in 2019, Cachalia said gangsters seemed to be winning the war. "Establishing gang units from time to time is an ad hoc response to a growing problem. I really don't think that we should be approaching this matter in a point-scoring way." He said South African police were doing their best to fight the violence "but the problem is a growing one. That is my view". His visit comes months after Nelson Mandela Bay was hit by a wave of killings. A deadly spike in violence hit the area in the latter half of last year, leaving 118 people dead between August and December, a local prevention group said. The violence has continued into the new year, with around 40 people killed across the region in January, local media reported. There are about three million legally held firearms in South Africa, but there are at least the same number of unlicensed weapons in circulation in the country, which has a population of 63 million, according to statistics cited by Gideon Joubert from the South African Gunowners' Association. Last month, 11 people were killed in a mass shooting linked to illegal mining turf wars near Johannesburg. The shooting occurred just two weeks after another attack at the Saulsville Hostel in the capital Pretoria, where 11 people, including a three-year-old child, were killed. In another incident last May, gunmen killed eight customers at a tavern in the south-eastern city of Durban. President Cyril Ramaphosa has promised stronger law enforcement action and increased police deployment to tackle the gang violence in the country.

Ex-intelligence officer accused of betraying Austria in Russia spying trial Former intelligence official Egisto Ott has gone on trial in Vienna, accused of spying for Russia in what is being dubbed Austria's biggest spy trial in years. Egisto Ott, who told the court on Thursday that he was not guilty, is charged with having handed over information to Russian intelligence officers and to Jan Marsalek, the fugitive executive of collapsed German payments firm Wirecard. The prosecutor told the court that Ott, 63, was "not romantic about Russia" but had acted out of financial motives and frustration with his career. Ott's lawyer, Anna Mair, rejected the allegations, asking: "Don't you think that if he had really been spying for Russia, he would have covered his tracks?" The prosecutor argued that people like him were "very susceptible" to working for the Russians: "They are frustrated in their careers and urgently need money." He had done "excellent" work for the Russian secret service", the prosecution added. "Simply put, this was betraying the country." Egisto Ott had been broke since 2013 at the latest, the court heard: "The Russian secret service pays very well." He is alleged to have "abused his authority" as an Austrian intelligence official by collecting large amounts of personal data, such as locations, vehicle registration numbers, or travel movements. Prosecutors say he did this between 2015 and 2020 without authorisation, often using national and international police databases. They also accuse him of supporting "a secret intelligence service of the Russian Federation to the detriment of the Republic of Austria" by collecting secret facts and a large amount of personal data from police databases between 2017 and 2021. The spy scandal has revived fears that Austria remains a hotbed of Russian espionage activity and observers will also be watching closely for details that could emerge about Jan Marsalek. Marsalek, who is also an Austrian citizen, is wanted by German police for alleged fraud and is currently believed to be in Moscow, having fled via Austria in 2020. The subject of an Interpol Red Notice, he is alleged to be an intelligence asset for the FSB, Russia's secretive security service. Prosecutors allege that Egisto Ott handed information to Marsalek and unknown representatives of the Russian intelligence service, and received payment in return. In 2022, they say, Marsalek commissioned him to obtain a laptop containing secret electronic security hardware used by EU states for secure electronic communication. The laptop, they say, was handed over to the Russian intelligence service. Egisto Ott is also suspected, reports say, of having passed phone data from senior Austrian interior ministry officials to Russia. Austria's Standard newspaper says Egisto Ott apparently obtained the work phones after they accidentally fell into the River Danube on an interior ministry boating trip. He is alleged to have copied their contents and passed them on to Jan Marsalek, and Moscow. Egisto Ott is charged with abuse of authority and corruption and espionage against Austria and faces up to five years in prison, if he is found guilty. When he was arrested in 2024, Austria's then Chancellor, Karl Nehammer, described the case as "a threat to democracy and our country's national security". In a separate development, prosecutors in the Austrian town of Wiener Neustadt have told the BBC that a former MP, Thomas Schellenbacher, has been charged with helping Marsalek to escape following the collapse of the Wirecard company in 2020, when it emerged that €1.9bn (£1.7bn) was missing from its accounts. Schellenbacher is alleged to have helped Jan Marsalek fly to Belarus, from Bad Vöslau in Austria, in June 2020. Schellenbacher was an MP for the far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ), which has been accused by Austria's Green Party, now in opposition, of enabling Russian espionage, of acting as "an extension of Russia's arm" in Austria. The FPÖ and its leader Herbert Kickl have denied the allegations - and have not faced any legal action in connection with any of them. Marsalek, who was the Wirecard's Chief Operating Officer, has since been charged with fraud and embezzlement, suspected of having inflated company's balance sheet total and sales volume. He is also believed to have been the controller of a group of Bulgarians who were convicted in London in 2025, of spying for Russia. Messages from that trial reveal Marsalek has had plastic surgery to alter his appearance as well as details of his life as a fugitive. "I'm off to bed. Had another cosmetic surgery, trying to look differently, and I am dead tired and my head hurts," he wrote to one of the Bulgarians, Roussev, on Telegram in February 2022. In another, dated 11 May 2021, Roussev congratulated Marsalek for learning Russian. "Well I am trying to improve my skills on a few fronts. Languages is one of them," the Austrian responded. "In my new role as an international fugitive I must outperform James Bond."

**Excerpt**

US allies won't forget Trump Greenland crisis What on earth has the last fortnight been all about? In the wake of a successful military operation in Venezuela earlier this month, a buoyed-up Donald Trump started to ratchet up the rhetoric on Greenland. Day after day, the world was treated to claims of ownership, threats of military action and tariffs against traditional allies in Europe. Now, in an apparent puff of smoke, it may all have gone. Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte, arguably the Trump whisperer-in-chief, seems to have talked the president down from his dangerously high hobby horse. The ground may have been laid last week during a visit to Washington by the foreign ministers of Denmark and Greenland. The visit concluded with agreement on a "working group" to discuss Greenland's future. But Rutte appears to have finessed an issue that had threatened to shatter the north Atlantic alliance. We don't yet know the details of the deal, but many will wonder why it needed a frenetic two-week crisis to get here. Denmark had long said that it was only too happy to see an increased American military presence on Greenland. If Nato has now pledged to up its presence on and around the island, then that will go some way towards reassuring Donald Trump that the alliance is finally paying proper attention to Greenland. The New York Times quotes anonymous officials as saying one idea under discussion is for Denmark to cede sovereignty over small areas of Greenland where the US would build military bases - similar to the arrangement by which the UK maintains sovereign bases on Cyprus. Trump said the deal would involve access to Greenland's mineral resources. Neither Denmark nor Nato has confirmed these or any other reports. Nato said discussions would "focus on ensuring Arctic security through the collective efforts, especially the seven Arctic Allies" (the US, Canada, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Iceland) and aimed to prevent Russia and China from gaining a foothold, economic or military, in Greenland. It won't be long before details of the deal emerge. But the fact that Donald Trump triggered a fortnight of high drama and a sense of existential crisis within Nato to get here will not easily be forgotten. Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney called it a "rupture", saying the old order was "not coming back." EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen spoke of "seismic change" and urged greater European independence. It's hard to see a quick return to business as usual.
