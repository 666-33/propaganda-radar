What could happen if the US strikes Iran? Here are seven scenarios The US appears poised to strike Iran within days. While the potential targets are largely predictable, the outcome is not. So, if no last-minute deal can be reached with Tehran and President Donald Trump decides to order US forces to attack, then what are the possible outcomes? 1. Targeted, surgical strikes, minimal civilian casualties, a transition to democracy US air and naval forces conduct limited, precision strikes targeting military bases of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) and the Basij unit - a paramilitary force under the control of the IRGC - ballistic missile launch and storage sites as well as Iran's nuclear programme. An already weakened regime is toppled, transitioning eventually to a genuine democracy where Iran can rejoin the rest of the world. This is a highly optimistic scenario. Western military intervention in both Iraq and Libya did not bring a smooth transition to democracy. Although it ended brutal dictatorships in both cases, it ushered in years of chaos and bloodshed. Syria, which conducted its own revolution, overthrowing President Bashar Al-Assad without Western military support in 2024, has so far fared better. 2. Regime survives but moderates its policies This could broadly be called the "Venezuelan model" whereby swift, powerful US action leaves the regime intact but with its policies moderated. In Iran's case, this would mean the Islamic Republic survived, which won't satisfy large numbers of Iranians, but is forced to curtail its support for violent militias across the Middle East, cease or curtail its domestic nuclear and ballistic missile programmes as well as easing up on its suppression of protests. Again, this is at the more unlikely end of the scale. The Islamic Republic leadership has remained defiant and resistant to change for 47 years. It appears incapable of changing course now. 3. Regime collapses, replaced by military rule Many think this is the most likely possible outcome. While the regime is clearly unpopular with many, and each successive wave of protests over the years weakens it further, there remains a huge and pervasive security deep state with a vested interest in the status quo. The principal reasons why the protests have so far failed to overthrow the regime is because there have been no significant defections to their side, while those in control are prepared to use unlimited force and brutality to remain in power. In the confusion of the aftermath of any US strikes it is conceivable that Iran ends up being ruled by a strong, military government composed largely of IRGC figures. 4. Iran retaliates by attacking US forces and neighbours It is clearly no match for the might of the US Navy and Air Force but it could still lash out with its arsenal of ballistic missiles and drones, many concealed in caves, underground or in remote mountainsides. There are US bases and facilities dotted along the Arabian side of the Gulf, notably in Bahrain and Qatar, but Iran could also, if it chose, target some of the critical infrastructure of any nation it considered was complicit in a US attack, such as Jordan. The devastating missile and drone attack on Saudi Aramco's petrochemical facilities in 2019, attributed to an Iranian-backed militia in Iraq, showed the Saudis just how vulnerable they were to Iranian missiles. Iran's Gulf Arab neighbours, all US allies, are understandably extremely jittery right now that any US military action is going to end up rebounding on them. 5. Iran retaliates by laying mines in the Gulf This has long loomed as a potential threat to global shipping and oil supplies ever since the Iran-Iraq war of 1980-88 when Iran did indeed mine the shipping lanes and Royal Navy minesweepers helped clear them. The narrow Strait of Hormuz between Iran and Oman is a critical chokepoint. Around 20% of the world's Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) exports and between 20-25% of oil and oil byproducts pass through this strait each year. Iran has conducted exercises in rapidly deploying sea mines. If it did so then it would inevitably impact world trade and oil prices. 6. Iran retaliates, sinking a US warship A US Navy Captain onboard a warship in the Gulf once told me that one of the threats from Iran he worries about most is a "swarm attack". This is where Iran launches so many high explosive drones and fast torpedo boats at a single or multiple targets that even the US Navy's formidable close-in defences are unable to eliminate all of them in time. The IRGC Navy has long replaced the conventional Iranian Navy in the Gulf, some of whose commanders were even trained at Dartmouth during the time of the Shah. Iran's naval crews have focussed much of their training on unconventional or "asymmetric" warfare, looking at ways to overcome or bypass the technical advantages enjoyed by their primary adversary, the US Navy's Fifth Fleet. The sinking of a US warship, accompanied by the possible capture of survivors among its crew, would be a massive humiliation for the US. While this scenario is thought unlikely, the billion-dollar destroyer the USS Cole was crippled by an Al-Qaeda suicide attack in Aden harbour in 2000, killing 17 US sailors. Before that, in 1987 an Iraqi jet pilot mistakenly fired two Exocet missiles at a US warship, the USS Stark, killing 37 sailors. 7. Regime collapses, replaced by chaos This is a very real danger and is one of the major concerns of neighbours like Qatar and Saudi Arabia. As well as the possibility of a civil war, such as experienced by Syria, Yemen and Libya, there is also the risk that in the chaos and confusion, ethnic tensions could spill over into armed conflict as Kurds, Baluchis and other minorities look to safeguard their own people amid a nationwide power vacuum. Much of the Middle East would certainly be glad to see the back of the Islamic Republic, none more so than Israel which has already dealt heavy blows to Iran's proxies across the region and which fears an existential threat from Iran's suspected nuclear programme. But nobody wants to see the largest Middle East nation by population - around 93 million - descend into chaos, sparking a humanitarian and refugee crisis. The greatest danger now is that President Trump, having amassed this powerful force close to Iran's borders, decides he must act or lose face, and a war begins with no clear end-state and with unpredictable and potentially damaging repercussions.

Heavy gunfire and blasts heard near airport in Niger's capital Sustained heavy gunfire and loud explosions have been heard in Niger near the international airport outside the capital, Niamey. Multiple eyewitness accounts and videos showed air defence systems apparently engaging unidentified projectiles in the early hours of Thursday. The situation later calmed down, reports say, with an official reportedly saying the situation was now under control, without elaborating. It is not clear what caused the blasts, or if there were any casualties. There has been no official statement from the military government. The gunfire and blasts began shortly after midnight, according to residents of a neighbourhood near the Diori Hamani International Airport, the AFP news agency reports. They said calm returned after two hours. The airport houses an air force base and is located about 10km (six miles) from the presidential palace. Niger is led by Abdourahamane Tiani who seized power in a 2023 coup that ousted the country's elected civilian president. Like its neighbours Burkina Faso and Mali, the country has been fighting jihadist groups who have carried out deadly attacks across the region. It is also a major producer of uranium. A huge uranium shipment destined for export has been stuck at the airport amid unresolved legal and diplomatic complications with France after the military government nationalised the country's uranium mines. "The situation is under control. There is no need to worry," the Anadolu news agency quoted a Foreign Affairs ministry official as saying, without elaborating. The official told the agency they were trying to determine whether the gunfire was linked to the uranium shipment.

**Excerpt**

China executes 11 members of Myanmar scam mafia China has executed 11 members of a notorious mafia family that ran scam centres in Myanmar along its north-eastern border, state media report. The Ming family members were sentenced in September for various crimes including homicide, illegal detention, fraud and operating gambling dens by a court in China's Zhejiang province. The Mings were one of many clans that ran the town of Laukkaing, transforming an impoverished backwater town into a flashy hub of casinos and red-light districts. Their scam empire came crashing down in 2023, when they were detained and handed over to China by ethnic militias that had taken control of Laukkaing during an escalation in their conflict with Myanmar's army. With these executions Beijing is sending a message of deterrence to would-be scammers. But the business has now moved to Myanmar's border with Thailand, and to Cambodia and Laos, where China has much less influence. Hundreds of thousands of people have been trafficked to run online scams in Myanmar and elsewhere in South East Asia, according to estimates by the UN. Among them are thousands of Chinese people, and their victims who they swindle billions of dollars from are mainly Chinese too. Frustrated by the Myanmar military's refusal to stop the scam business, from which it was almost certainly profiting, Beijing tacitly backed an offensive by an ethnic insurgent alliance in Shan State in late 2023. The alliance captured significant territory from the military and overran Laukkaing, a key border town. Who are the Ming family? The eleven members of the Ming family are the first of the Myanmar scam bosses to be executed by China. But they will not be the last. Five members of the Bai family were also sentenced to death in November, and the trials of two other groups of defendants from the Wei and the Liu families have not yet concluded. The Ming family's trial was held behind closed doors, although more than 160 people were allowed to attend their sentencing hearing last year, including families of victims. The Ming mafia's scam operations and gambling dens brought in more than 10bn yuan ($1.4bn; £1bn) between 2015 and 2023, according to China's highest court, which rejected their appeals in November. Their crimes resulted in the deaths of 14 Chinese citizens and injuries to many others, the court said. More than 20 others from the Ming family were given jail sentences in September ranging from five years to life. Ming Xuechang, the clan's patriarch, killed himself in 2023 while trying to avoid detention, Myanmar's military had said back then. The confessions of those who were arrested were aired in state media documentaries, to emphasise Chinese authorities' resolve to eradicate scam networks. The Mings were among a handful of Godfather-esque families who rose to power in Laukkaing in the early 2000s. This was after the town's then warlord was ousted in a military operation led by Min Aung Hlaing, who became the leader of Myanmar's military government after the 2021 coup. The head of the family, Ming Xuechang, ran one of the most infamous of Laukkaing's scam centres, Crouching Tiger Villa. At first gambling and prostitution were the main sources of income for these families, but they eventually started online fraud, staffed mostly by people who were kidnapped and forced to run these scams. Within the walls of the sprawling, well-guarded compounds was a culture of violence. Beatings and torture were routine, according to testimonies collected from freed workers.

### 4. [Indians pay tribute after Arijit Singh retires at 38 as Bollywood singer](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cddgpp7jpm8o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

Indians pay tribute after Arijit Singh retires at 38 as Bollywood singer Heartbroken fans of renowned Indian singer Arijit Singh have been paying tribute to him after he announced he would no longer take on new playback assignments, marking the end of a defining chapter in contemporary Bollywood music. Some described his voice as "the sound of our heartbreaks and celebrations", while others called it "a presence in every corner of our lives". In Indian cinema, playback singing refers to studio recordings of songs that actors lip‑sync on screen - a bedrock of Bollywood storytelling. Singh's voice became inseparable from that tradition, providing vocals for romantic ballads and chart‑topping soundtracks in recent years. The 38-year-old, who has collaborated with global pop icons like Ed Sheeran, made his announcement on Instagram on Tuesday. "I am calling it off. It was a wonderful journey," he said. Fans then flooded social media with posts reflecting on how his songs, which consistently topped the charts, had become part of India's cultural soundtrack. Singh did not explain why he was quitting playback singing, but reports say he will finish existing commitments and projects and continue making music independently, exploring creative projects beyond commercial cinema. The decision is unusually bold for a singer at the peak of his career. Singh recently performed to a sold-out crowd at Wembley Arena in London, a milestone few Indian playback singers achieve. His voice - bruised, buttery and intimate - has been an inescapable undercurrent of Bollywood, narrating heartbreaks, longings and reconciliations for millions for more than a decade. Yet, even at the height of fame, he chooses to remain on the margins of celebrity culture, visibly ambivalent about his own success. He rarely gives interviews, avoids publicity stunts and appears in public dressed like someone you might miss entirely: soft-spoken, his face concealed in a hoodie. "I hate being a celebrity," he told Forbes India in an early interview, describing himself as someone who stumbled into fame by accident. Singh was born in 1987 in Jiagang, a small town in West Bengal state, into a household where music was not an aspiration but a daily practice, permeating every aspect of life. His mother and grandmother were trained classical singers and his aunt also taught music. Classical training came early - he learnt tabla alongside vocal training - but so did exposure to popular music. Singh's first teacher, Birendra Prasad Hazari, recalled him as a toddler at the local music school, eyes fixed on the harmonium before he could even pronounce the notes. Hazari told the Indian newspaper The Telegraph he had "never come across a singer as talented", noting the boy's rapid progression from early raga lessons to the voice the world would later know. Singh's first brush with national attention came in 2005 when he appeared on the reality singing show, Fame Gurukul (Fame Academy). He did not win and his presence barely registered. But the setback, in some ways, proved formative. Singh returned to Kolkata city in West Bengal, where he worked as a music programmer and assistant, learning studio work. For several years, he existed on the margins of the industry he would later dominate. When recognition finally arrived, it did so with unusual force. In 2013, Singh sang Tum Hi Ho for the film, Aashiqui 2. The song released at a time when Bollywood's romantic music leaned toward scale and spectacle. Singh's voice - inward and raw - had the opposite effect, reintroducing vulnerability to Bollywood audiences as an acceptable emotion. The song became so popular it outgrew the film to become a national obsession. It was everywhere, flooding radio, weddings and reality shows, the slowbuild, aching notes articulating romantic devotion that felt cinematic yet intensely personal. For months, it felt difficult to move through cities and towns without encountering it. What followed was a period of extraordinary success. Overnight, Singh became Bollywood's most relateable voice, recording across many languages - Hindi, Bengali, Tamil and Telugu - and sometimes singing multiple songs in a single film. He collaborated repeatedly with leading composers including Pritam, AR Rahman, Vishal–Shekhar and Amit Trivedi. Singh appeared uncomfortable with the fame that followed and shunned media attention, often skipping award ceremonies. On stage too he remained informal. At concerts, he chats with the audience, takes requests, sometimes stopping mid-song to adjust the arrangement, or to scold his fans for spending too much time recording, instead of being present. In his personal life, Singh works with a small team and has chosen to base himself primarily in his hometown - where he's routinely seen slipping out on a scooter to pick up groceries or catching up with old friends - over the glamour of big cities. International visitors, including Dutch DJ Martin Garrix and Sheeran, have reportedly visited his Jiaganj residence. In recent years, his output has also become more selective, with him choosing to focus more on independent projects. There was also criticism: some listeners and critics have argued that many of his songs started to sound alike, with his trademark husky, introspective delivery creating a sense of sameness across different films and genres. In a 2017 interview, Singh admitted he was trying to cut down on projects because he found it "uncomfortable" to hear his songs playing everywhere. "Of course people will be exhausted if you continue to sing 100 songs a year," he said. Fans are now wondering what comes next. Some interpret this week's announcement as the natural evolution of an artist who finds fame stifling. Others see it as a statement on the pressures of commercial music, or simply the next step in his journey of self-exploration. Whatever the reason, his voice will keep defining music in India.

Plane crashes in Colombia, killing all 15 on board A passenger plane has crashed in northern Colombia, killing all 15 people on board, the country's state-run airline Satena confirmed. In a statement, it said its aircraft - a Beechcraft 1900 - "suffered a fatal accident", but gave no further details. The wreckage has now been located in a mountainous area. The official passenger list includes lawmaker Diógenes Quintero Amaya and Carlos Salcedo, a candidate in upcoming congressional elections. Satena earlier said contact with the plane was lost 11 minutes before it had been scheduled to land in the city of Ocaña, near the Venezuelan border, at 12:05 local time (17:05 GMT) on Wednesday. According to the airline, Flight NSE 8849 took off from the city of Cúcuta, about 100km (62 miles) north-east from Ocaña, carrying 13 passengers and two crew members. A search operation has been launched in the mountainous area, and a hotline was set up for the relatives of those who were on the plane. Speaking to local news outlet Semana, governor of Norte de Santander William Villamizar said seven bodies have been recovered. Colombia's armed forces have been helping with the search effort in the area where the plane went missing, which has areas controlled by Colombia's ELN guerrilla group. The country's president Gustavo Petro expressed his condolences to the families of the victims on X, writing "I am deeply sorry for these deaths". A statement acknowledging Quintero's death has been shared from his Facebook page, describing him as "a man who throughout his life served those who needed it most". Quintero held one of 16 seats in Colombia's parliament intended to represent victims of conflict between between the Marxist rebel army, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc), and the Colombian state.

**Excerpt**

At least five killed after Storm Kristin hits Portugal At least five people have died after Storm Kristin tore through central and northern Portugal, causing flooding, landslides and widespread damage. The storm, which the government described as an "extreme climatic event", left schools shuttered, buildings damaged and travel severely disrupted. In the coastal city of Figueira da Foz, a Ferris wheel overturned and several vehicles were hit when part of a roof was torn from a building. Portugal has been hit by a succession of storms in recent days, including one over the weekend in which a man died after his car was swept away in floods. Heavy rain and wind gusts of up to 150km (95 miles) per hour caused more than 3,000 weather-related incidents across the country, civil protection authorities said. Several people were struck by falling trees or debris. The strongest winds were recorded at the Monte Real air base in Leiria, where gusts of 178km were recorded before the monitoring equipment was destroyed. Officials said the location was likely the storm's entry point to mainland Portugal. More than 850,000 people lost power on Wednesday, according to electricity distributor E-Redes. The civil protection agency (ANEPC) reported that three people had died in the central district of Leiria - one of the worst affected areas. In Leira, one person was hit by a metal sheet, and another was trapped in the structure of a house, according to officials. Local media said a man in Vila Franca de Xira died when a tree struck his car, local media said. There were also reports of a death in the Marinha Grande area. Transport across Portugal has been severely disrupted, with roads - including the main motorway connecting Lisbon to the north - and railways blocked by debris. Ten coastal areas were placed under a red weather warning on Wednesday due to dangerous sea conditions, with waves forecast to reach up to 14m (45ft,11in), according to the Portuguese Institute of the Sea and Atmosphere (IPMA). The PSP (Public Security Police) urged people in Coimbra and Leira to stay inside, while Portugal's Secretary of State for Civil Protection said the country remained on maximum alert. Prime Minister Luis Montenegro expressed condolences to the victims' families. He said authorities were assessing the damage and would take "whatever measures are necessary". Meanwhile, Leiria's mayor, Goncalo Lopes, urged the government to declare a state of emergency. "We have public spaces turned upside down," he told reporters. "It's something that will require a very large recovery effort in the coming months. The impact is similar to what a bomb could mean in our city, with massive destruction." After crossing Portugal, Storm Kristin moved east into Spain - bringing with it snow, rain and strong winds. The storm caused widespread disruption across the country, with schools, roads and train lines closed and hundreds of thousands without power. In Andalusia, emergency services reported some 2,000 weather-related incidents. Spain's national weather agency, AEMET, warned of very strong winds in some areas, with gusts expected to reach hurricane force. A red weather alert has been issued for parts of Almeria in the south-east due to the strength of the wind.

### 7. [Trump warns Iran 'time is running out' for nuclear deal as US military builds up in Gulf](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly5pd459gko?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

Trump warns Iran 'time is running out' for nuclear deal as US military builds up in Gulf Donald Trump has warned Iran that "time is running out" to negotiate a deal on its nuclear programme following the steady build-up of US military forces in the Gulf. The US president said a "massive Armada" was "moving quickly, with great power, enthusiasm, and purpose" towards Iran, referring to a large US naval fleet. In response, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said the country's armed forces were ready "with their fingers on the trigger" to "immediately and powerfully respond" to any aggression by land or sea. Iran insists its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful and has repeatedly denied accusations by the US and its allies that it is seeking to develop nuclear weapons. Trump's latest warning follows his promise that Washington will intervene to help those involved in the brutal and unprecedented crackdown on protests in the country earlier this month. Demonstrations began after a sharp fall in the value of the Iranian currency, but swiftly evolved into a crisis of legitimacy for the country's clerical leadership. "Help is on the way," Trump said, before later changing his tune and saying he had been told on good authority that the execution of demonstrators had stopped. The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) says it has confirmed the killing of more than 6,301 people, including 5,925 protesters, since the unrest began at the end of December. HRANA says it is also investigating another 17,000 reported deaths received despite an internet shutdown after nearly three weeks. Another group, the Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR), has warned that the final toll could exceed 25,000. Trump's latest comments on Iran appeared to focus more on the country's nuclear programme. "Hopefully Iran will quickly 'Come to the Table' and negotiate a fair and equitable deal - NO NUCLEAR WEAPONS," he wrote on Truth Social. He said the naval force in the Gulf was larger than the one he sent to Venezuela before US forces seized the country's former leader Nicolás Maduro. Trump added that this force was "ready, willing, and able to rapidly fulfil its mission, with speed and violence, if necessary". Referring to the US strikes on Iranian nuclear sites last June, which were launched during Iran's 12-day war with Israel, the US president warned: "The next attack will be far worse! Don't make that happen again." Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, the Speaker of Iran's parliament, said in an interview with CNN thatTehran was ready to negotiate with the US, but only if talks were "genuine". However, did not think that was "the kind of talk the president of the United States is after; he just wants to impose (his will on others)". "Maybe Mr Trump can start a war, but he doesn't have control over (how it ends)," he added. Speaking to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the Iranian "regime is probably weaker than it's ever been". "They don't have a way to address the core complaints of the protesters, which is that their economy is in collapse," Rubio said. He added: "What you're seeing now is the ability to posture assets in the region to defend against what could be an Iranian threat against our personnel." Responding to Trump's latest warning, Araghchi said: "Iran has always welcomed a mutually beneficial, fair and equitable NUCLEAR DEAL - on equal footing, and free from coercion, threats, and intimidation - which ensures Iran's rights to PEACEFUL nuclear technology, and guarantees NO NUCLEAR WEAPONS." "Such weapons have no place in our security calculations and we have NEVER sought to acquire them," he added. Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Kazem Gharibabadi said that no negotiations with the US were currently under way, despite "exchanges of messages". Using open-source tools, BBC Verify has been able to track some of the recent US deployments to the region, with satellite images showing that at least 15 fighter jets arrived at Jordan's Muwaffaq Air Force Base. There has also been an increase in the number of aircraft arriving at bases in Jordan, Qatar, and Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean. BBC Verify has identified dozens of cargo planes and refuelling aircraft arriving in the Middle East, while drones and P-8 Poseidon spy planes have been seen on the FlightRadar24 tracking site operating near Iranian airspace. A naval "armada", as Trump referred to it, led by the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier has also arrived in the Middle East, a US defence official confirmed to BBC Verify. On Monday an Osprey aircraft's tracker was seen on FlightRadar24 landing in Oman after leaving an offshore location in the Gulf, suggesting that the Lincoln could be operating somewhere nearby. "In the past two weeks, the US has surged naval and aerial assets to the region, significantly increasing its regional posture," Megan Sutcliffe, a principal analyst at the risk advisory firm Sibylline, said. Satellite images show that at least two US guided missile destroyers and three combat ships have been docked in Bahrain for several months. Meanwhile, Tehran has deployed the IRIS Shahid Bagheri - a drone carrier ship which entered service last year - just off the Iranian coast, satellite images show. Under a 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, Iran was not permitted to enrich uranium above 3.67% purity - the level required for fuel for commercial nuclear power plants - and was not allowed to carry out any enrichment at its Fordo plant for 15 years. However, Trump abandoned the agreement during his first term in 2018, saying it did too little to stop a pathway to a bomb, and reinstated US sanctions, which crippled the Iranian economy. Tehran retaliated by increasingly breaching restrictions under the deal, particularly those related to the production of enriched uranium, which is used to make reactor fuel but also nuclear weapons. US officials, quoted by American media, have said Iran must stop enriching uranium, limit its missile programme and stop supporting proxy groups in the Middle East, as part of a new nuclear deal. The last time the US took action against Iranian nuclear sites was June last year, when it targeted three uranium enrichment facilities in Iran: Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan. US officials then said the operation - codenamed "Midnight Hammer" - had significantly set back the prospect of Tehran building a nuclear weapon. However, Hassan Abedini, the deputy political director of Iran's state broadcaster, claimed that the country "didn't suffer a major blow because the materials had already been taken out" of the facilities. In retaliation, Iran launched missiles on a US military base in Qatar - an attack described by Trump as "very weak" and "expected". Additional reporting by Joshua Cheetham, Matt Murphy, Alex Murray, Barbara Metzler and Sofia Ferreira Santos.
