Trump says Putin will not attack Ukraine cities during cold week US President Donald Trump says Russia's Vladimir Putin has agreed not to attack Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, and other cities and towns for a week due to "extraordinary cold" weather. Russia has not confirmed any such agreement, but Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky welcomed Trump's announcement and said he expected Russia to keep its promise. Trump did not specify when the pause would begin, but temperatures in the Ukrainian capital are due to plummet from Thursday night and reach -24C (-11F) in the next few days. Russia has intensified attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure during the bitter winter, as it has during cold periods since the full-scale invasion began in 2022. Speaking at a televised cabinet meeting in Washington DC, the US president said: "I personally asked President Putin not to fire into Kyiv and the various towns for a week, and he agreed to do that." "It was very nice. A lot of people said, 'Don't waste the call, you're not going to get that.' And he [Putin] did it," Trump added. The Ukrainians, he said, "almost they didn't believe it, but they were very happy about it because they are struggling badly". Later on Thursday, in a post on social media, Zelensky said Trump had made an "important statement" about "the possibility of providing security for Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities during this extreme winter period". "Our teams discussed this in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). We expect the agreements to be implemented," he said. The BBC understands that Ukraine has agreed to mirror Moscow's actions - pausing its own attacks on Russian oil refineries in response. Last week, Russian, Ukrainian and US negotiators met in the UAE for the first trilateral talks since the war began. All sides described the talks as constructive, but there has been no announcement that Russia had agreed to pause its attacks for the duration of the extreme cold currently gripping the region. Instead, attacks have continued, crippling the power supply to major Ukrainian cities, leaving millions without heating or electricity. Electrical companies carry out round-the-clock repairs, but their work can be quickly undone by Russian air attacks. Even when power is restored, the supply only lasts a few hours - enough to charge appliances but not to substantially warm up homes.

Agents in Minneapolis could be pulled back if local officials cooperate, border tsar says The Trump administration has suggested it is planning to "draw down" federal forces in Minnesota if there is cooperation from officials, after the fatal shootings of two US citizens in the state. At a press conference in Minneapolis, White House Border Tsar Tom Homan vowed to continue the immigration enforcement operation, but added he wants "common sense cooperation that allows us to draw down on the number of people we have here". "We are not surrendering our mission at all. We're just doing it smarter," Homan said. The deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti have ignited local protests and public outcry across the country, and led to criticism from lawmakers. It was not clear how many federal forces might leave the city, or when, raising new questions about how far the Trump administration will scale back its operation after the president said he was seeking to "de-escalate" in Minneapolis. Homan added: "President Trump wants this fixed, and I'm going to fix it." The killings of Good and Pretti by agents carrying out Trump's immigration crackdown this month have provoked protests in Minneapolis, public outcry across the US and calls from lawmakers in both parties for some administration officials to be removed. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey have called for a withdrawal of federal agents entirely from the state's capital region. The state has also asked a federal judge to stop "Operation Metro Surge", which involves approximately 3,000 immigration, border patrol and other Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officers. The administration, meanwhile, has blasted local officials, saying they should work with federal officers and agents and also criticised Minneapolis for having a "sanctuary city policy" that bars city employees from enforcing immigration laws. Homan on Thursday said changes in the operation would depend on how much state and local officials cooperate with federal authorities, and added the administration disagreed with some of Frey and Walz's demands, but did not specify which ones. In the hours after Pretti was killed on Saturday, Walz spoke with the White House twice, and since then he and Frey, both Democrats, have had phone calls with Trump. In general, Homan provided few clues on what changes the administration would be willing to make. He said the federal operation in Minneapolis would be more "targeted", but did not offer more details. While he pledged to "fix" the crackdown in Minneapolis, Homan also defended the administration's immigration enforcement measures, saying that tightening border security and targeting undocumented immigrants for deportation had made the country safer. In Trump's first year back in office, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which is part of DHS, carried out over 480,000 deportations, according to an agency document obtained by the BBC's US partner CBS News. The figure exceeds the previous high of 410,000 recorded in 2012, when former President Barack Obama was in office. The DHS is currently holding more than 75,000 people in detention, according to the document. Trump has sent federal agents, as well as the National Guard, to major US cities over the last year to make good on his campaign promise to crack down on illegal immigration. They have been met by protests and legal challenges in Democrat-led cities like Portland, Los Angeles and Chicago. After frustration with the administration's handling of Good and Pretti's deaths appeared to reach a boiling point, both on the streets of Minneapolis and in the halls of Capitol Hill, Trump sent Homan to the city this week to take over the operation, sidelining Border Patrol chief Gregory Bovino, who had also led crackdowns in Chicago and other cities. It's unclear whether Homan's remarks on Thursday will appease lawmakers in Washington, though. Several House and Senate Republicans have called for investigations into the Good and Pretti shootings. Senate Democrats have threatened a partial government shutdown if a spending package includes new funding for DHS, as well. On Thursday, seven Senate Republicans joined Democrats in blocking a procedural vote on the spending bill, raising the likelihood of a partial shutdown at the end of the week. The vote came as Senate leaders and the White House worked on a deal that would remove DHS funding from the package, allowing the government to send money to other agencies and give both sides more time to negotiate a separate spending plan for DHS. Senate Democrats want any bill to fund DHS to restrict the tactics that ICE uses in the field, specifically calling for them to stop wearing masks and carrying out searches and arrests without a judge's warrant. In a memo made public earlier this month, ICE authorised its agents to make warrantless searches. "This is a moment of truth," Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a floor speech Thursday. "What ICE is doing, outside the law, is state-sanctioned thuggery and it must stop." Trump said during a cabinet meeting on Thursday that the White House was working with Democrats to avoid a shutdown. Speaking at a conference for mayors in Washington on Thursday, Frey continued calling for an end to the federal operation in his city. He also visited Capitol Hill. There were 3,000 to 4,000 federal forces in Minneapolis, Frey said, vastly outnumbering the city's 600 local police officers. Homan did not confirm how many federal forces were present when asked to provide an updated figure on Thursday. "People have been indiscriminately pulled off the street," Frey said. "American citizens have been yanked away from their homes after that, solely because they look like they are from Mexico or Ecuador or Somalia." He added: "That's not how we operate in America."

**Excerpt**

EU adds Iran's Revolutionary Guards to terrorist list The European Union has added Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) to its terrorist list in response to Tehran's deadly crackdown on protesters in recent weeks. "Repression cannot go unanswered," the bloc's top diplomat Kaja Kallas said, adding the move will put the IRGC - a major military, economic and political force in Iran - on the same level as jihadist groups like al-Qaeda and the Islamic State group. Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said the EU decision was a "stunt" and a "major strategic mistake". Human rights groups estimate thousands of protesters were killed by security forces, including the IRGC, during weeks of unrest in December and January. Speaking in Brussels on Thursday, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot described it as "the most violent repression in Iran's modern history" and said there could be "no impunity for the crimes committed". France had previously been seen as hesitant to add the IRGC to the EU's terror list over fears this could put an end to all diplomatic ties with Iran. But it changed course on Wednesday, coming out strongly behind a push to blacklist the group, which was led by Italy. "Any regime that kills thousands of its own people is working toward its own demise," Kaja Kallas said in a brief statement on social media. Kallas said she expected diplomatic channels to remain open with Iran, even after adding the IRGC to its list of groups involved in acts of terror. The EU has also placed new sanctions on six entities and 15 individuals in Iran, including its Interior Minister Eskandar Momeni, Prosecutor General Mohammad Movahedi Azad, and Iman Afshari, a presiding judge. "They were all involved in the violent repression of peaceful protests and the arbitrary arrest of political activists and human rights defenders," the bloc said in a statement. Organisations on the EU's terrorist list are subject to sanctions including travel bans and asset freezes, with the aim of removing their support networks. Iran's most powerful armed force, the IRGC was set up shortly after the 1979 revolution to defend the country's Islamic system. It is estimated to have about 190,000 active personnel, with capabilities across land, air and sea, as well as overseeing Iran's strategic weapons. It exerts influence overseas by providing money, weapons, technology and advice to allied governments and armed groups, and also controls the paramilitary Basij Resistance Force inside Iran, which has hundreds of thousands of members and has been used to suppress dissent. Australia, Canada and the US have already classified the IRGC as a terror group but it has not been proscribed in the UK. On Wednesday, UK Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy condemned Iran's "brutal oppression of peaceful protesters" but said it was long-standing government policy "not to comment on whether a specific organisation is being considered for proscription". The EU's announcement comes after US President Donald Trump said a "massive Armada", was moving quickly towards Iran "with great power, enthusiasm, and purpose". Trump warned that "time was running out" for Iran to negotiate a deal on its nuclear programme and urged Tehran to "come to the table". He threatened an attack that was "far worse" than the US strikes on Iran last year if a deal was not reached. The Iranian foreign minister said the country's armed forces were ready "with their fingers on the trigger" to "immediately and powerfully respond" to any aggression. Araghchi said that rather than working to avert "all-out war in our region" Europe is "busy fanning the flames". Trump's latest warning follows his promise that Washington would intervene to help those involved in the deadly crackdown on protesters earlier this month. An internet blackout imposed by Iran's authorities has made assessing the scale of the government's violence against protesters difficult. The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (Hrana) said it had confirmed the killing of more than 6,301 people, including 5,925 protesters, while another group, the Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR), said the final toll could exceed 25,000. Iranian authorities have said more than 3,100 people had been killed, but that the majority were security personnel or bystanders attacked by "rioters". Most international news organisations, including the BBC, are barred from reporting inside Iran. But videos showing security forces firing live ammunition at crowds have been verified by the BBC.

### 4. [France moves to abolish concept of marital duty to have sex](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgjwxdz45ywo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

France moves to abolish concept of marital duty to have sex France is to enshrine in law the end of so-called "conjugal rights" – the notion that marriage means a duty to have sex. A bill approved on Wednesday in the National Assembly adds a clause to the country's civil code to make clear that "community of living" does not create an "obligation for sexual relations". The proposed law also makes it impossible to use lack of sexual relations as an argument in fault-based divorce. Though unlikely to have a major impact in the courts, supporters hope the law will help deter marital rape. "By allowing such a right or duty to persist, we are collectively giving our approval to a system of domination and predation by husband on wife," said the bill's sponsor, Green MP Marie-Charlotte Garin. "Marriage cannot be a bubble in which consent to sex is regarded as definitive and for life." The law will erase an ambiguity that has persisted despite there being no explicit mention of "conjugal duty" in any legal text. Currently, the French civil code defines the duties of marriage as "respect, fidelity, support and assistance," and it says that couples commit themselves to a "community of living". Nowhere in the texts is there any mention of "conjugal" - ie sexual - rights. The origins of that notion lie in medieval church law. However judges in modern divorce suits have, from time to time, given a broad interpretation to the concept of "community of living" to include sexual relations. In a famous case in 2019 a woman was found to have withheld sex from her husband for several years, and he was then granted a "fault-based" divorce implying guilt on her part. But the woman then took her case to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), which last year condemned France for allowing refusal of sex to be grounds for a fault-based divorce. This was hailed as an important advance by feminist campaigners. The ECHR's decision has made it, in practice, impossible for any French divorce judge to make a similar ruling - which is why the new law is mainly intended as a clarification, with the change unlikely to have a major impact on the courts. For campaigners, the notion that wives have a "duty" to agree to sex with their husbands is one that persists in parts of society and needs to be confronted. The Mazan trial of 2024 – where a drugged and unconscious Gisèle Pelicot was repeatedly raped by men invited by her husband - is seen as emblematic. Several defendants said they assumed her consent because of what her husband had told them. In France, as in most other countries, marital rape is now enshrined in law, where prior to 1990 men could argue that marriage implied consent. Since November last year the legal definition of rape in France has also been expanded to include the notion of non-consent. Previously, rape was defined as a sexual act carried out with "violence, constraint, threat or surprise". Now it is any act where there is no "informed, specific, anterior and revocable" consent. Silence or an absence of reaction do not imply consent, the law says.

Chips, anyone? German farm gives away millions of potatoes after bumper harvest A vast stockpile of potatoes is being given away for free by a farm in the German state of Saxony, after a bumper harvest . Thousands of tasty tubers have been rolling into the country's capital, Berlin, since mid-January, with residents risking icy streets to bag their share. Dubbed "the great potato rescue" it is part of a plan to stop about 4 million kg (8.8 million lb) of surplus spuds from going to ruin. Food banks, schools and churches are among the beneficiaries, according to organisers. However, the enterprise was labelled a "disgusting PR stunt" by the Brandenburg Farmers' Association, which lamented the impact on local markets. Germany is the European Union's potato-producing capital, and last year's harvest has left the market saturated. Ultimately it is about "putting the potato in the spotlight as a valuable food," said Berliner Morgenpost editor, Peter Schink who helped spearhead the plan. The newspaper teamed up with eco-friendly search engine firm, Ecosia, to co-ordinate and fund the distribution of the spuds. Not wishing to discard its "magnificent tubers" back into the fields, Osterland Agrar says it's set to have bussed around 500,000kg to Berlin, and other parts of Germany and Ukraine. "We can store them until the middle of this year," said Hans-Joachim von Massow, Managing Director of Osterland Agrar, the agricultural firm that ended up with all the potatoes. But not everyone is celebrating. "Food is and will remain valuable, even if thoughtless do-gooders throw around free potatoes at schools and churches," said Timo Scheib from the Brandenburg Farmers' Association. The BBC skidded optimistically along to a pickup spot at the city's de-commissioned airfield, Tempelhofer Feld, but there were no veggie sacks to be seen. And when we sheepishly asked a local resident about whether she'd noticed any "frei Kartoffeln" in the area she seemed slightly mystified, if not a little concerned for me. Nevertheless, as potatoes took off out of Saxony, so has the story, receiving media coverage in Germany and beyond. However we are told by Schink that the influx is, as things stand, set to wind down in Berlin as the funding is drying up. One more truckload can be expected once the weather is warm enough.

**Excerpt**

Israeli media cite official accepting Hamas figure of 70,000 war dead Israeli media report that a senior security source has said the military accepts that more than 70,000 Palestinians have been killed during the war in Gaza. Israel has previously cast doubt on figures from the Hamas-run health ministry. But their figures have been deemed reliable by the UN and other human rights groups and widely cited by international media. The war began after the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, when about 1,200 other people were killed and 251 were taken hostage. Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 71,660 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. It says at least 492 Palestinians have been killed since a ceasefire began on 10 October 2025. Four Israeli soldiers have also been killed. Israel has always disputed the Hamas figures and said before last year's ceasefire it had killed 1,600 fighters since 7 October 2023 and another 22,000 combatants in the war. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) previously said it believed two or three civilians had been killed for every dead militant. Now a senior military source has indicated to Israeli journalists, including those from Haaretz and the Times of Israel, that the total number given by the Hamas health ministry is largely accurate, even though they have not been able to break down how many were combatants and how many died as a direct result of the fighting. Following the latest Israeli media reports, a military official said the details published did not reflect official IDF data. "Any publication or report on this matter will be released through official and orderly channels," the IDF official said.

**Excerpt**

Melania Trump documentary not showing in South African cinemas Cinemas in South Africa will not be showing the documentary about US First Lady Melania Trump that is due to be released around the world on Friday. The South African distributor Filmfinity has decided not to release it, its head of sales and marketing told the New York Times and South Africa-based website News24. The company was not explicit about the reasons behind the move. The film, Melania, is not promoted on the websites of the country's main cinema chains. One Cape Town independent cinema contacted by the BBC said that it was called by Filmfinity and told not to list it. Relations between the US and South Africa have seriously deteriorated over the past year. Amazon has reportedly paid $35m (£25m) to market the film which follows Melania Trump in the 20 days leading up to her husband's second inauguration on 20 January last year. It is also believed that Amazon paid around $40m for the rights to the film. "Based on recent developments, we've taken the decision to not go ahead with a theatrical release in territory," Filmfinity's Thobashan Govindarajulu is quoted as saying by the New York Times. He told News24 that the decision had been taken "given the current climate". The executive did not elaborate on what was he meant by "recent developments" or "current climate". Attempts by the BBC to get comment from Filmfinity, which describes itself as the leading film distributor in southern Africa, have so far been unsuccessful. But contacting the independent Labia cinema in Cape Town, the BBC was told that it was called by Filmfinity who said that the film would not be playing. Show times for Melania are not listed on the websites of South Africa's two main cinema chains, Ster Kinekor and Nu Metro. Nu Metro trailed the film on its Instagram account a fortnight ago. Its website's Melania page still exists, but does not list any show times - unlike the page for the drama Hamnet, which is also released in South Africa on Friday. Since Donald Trump came to power a year ago, US relations with South Africa have slumped. He has been promoting the widely discredited idea that there is a "white genocide" against South Africa's Afrikaner community. Last May, Trump confronted South African counterpart Cyril Ramaphosa over the issue in a tense White House meeting. The president has also imposed high tariffs on South African goods and cut aid programmes. His anger was also partly fuelled by Pretoria's role in bringing a case against Israel to the International Court of Justice (ICJ). The US ally has strongly rejected the allegation of genocide against Palestinians in Gaza as "baseless".

**Excerpt**

Imran Khan not the only one silenced as Pakistan military stifles dissent Pakistan's jailed former prime minister Imran Khan hasn't seen any visitors in more than five weeks, according to his party. His family say this is partly to stop his words reaching the outside world. They blame the country's military chief, Field Marshall Asim Munir, a charge the government rejects. It says the meetings stopped because Khan broke jail rules prohibiting discussion of politics. While Khan may be silenced, he's far from the only one under pressure. Journalists, analysts and human rights advocates say the space to disagree with the state is increasingly limited – and the risks greater. Last weekend, human rights lawyer Imaan Mazari and her husband were convicted of sharing anti-state social media posts. The couple will spend 10 years in jail. Ahead of sentencing, Amnesty International had called on Pakistan to end "coercive tactics used to silence dissent and intimidate those who defend human rights". Khan's family are very clear about the effort to wipe him from the public's mind. "There are two names you can't have on television. You can't say anything nice about Imran Khan, and you can't say anything bad about Asim Munir," his sister Aleema Khanum told the BBC. She was speaking at a recent protest by supporters a few kilometres from his cell in Rawalpindi's Adiala jail. It's been more than eight weeks since Khan saw a family member, more than five since he met a lawyer and then it was only for eight minutes, his party says. "This is the only way we have right now to create enough pressure that we are allowed to meet him," Khanum said at the protest. "It's his right to meet his lawyers, it's his right to meet his family, it's his communication with the outside world." That communication from Khan has often been highly critical of Pakistan's government and military chief. After meetings inside the jail, Khan's words have often been posted on his X account, attributed to him and giving directions to his party and supporters. "They are unable to block his voice because people want to hear him, they read his messages, they are not giving up on him," Khanum says. But for now, with meetings stopped, so have those messages. Khan, imprisoned since August 2023, is convicted in several corruption cases which he says are politically motivated. The government and military reject claims he is being held in isolation. Talal Chaudhry, an interior minister, has called him "the most privileged prisoner in Pakistan", with gym equipment and a cook. After a post appeared quoting Khan on his X account, calling Munir a "mentally unstable person", the military spokesperson held a two-hour news conference broadcast across Pakistan's media, saying Khan had gone beyond politics and labelled him a national security threat. "One could argue that the military is really leading the country on so many levels now that Pakistan's coming quite close to authoritarian rule," says Michael Kugelman, senior fellow on South Asia at the Atlantic Council. "This is the worst the repression has been during any period of civilian rule." Pakistan's military, often referred to as "the establishment", have been an ever-present factor in the country politics, including periods of military dictatorship. Initially, Khan and the military appeared close; many believe their backing helped bring Khan to power and the opposition at the time initially accused him of being in thrall to the military while he governed. Khan's party denied this. By the time he was ousted in a vote of no confidence in 2022, Khan had not only fallen out with the military leadership, but blamed them for his removal from power. In November 2025, a constitutional amendment granted Munir lifetime immunity from prosecution and oversight of all Pakistan's defence forces. Many saw it as a further sign that the military's influence over Pakistan was at a high-water mark under a civilian government. The current government deny the military are calling the shots. "The civilian government is [taking] decisions. We are all working hand in glove," Chaudhry says, adding the chief of defence forces "is doing a marvellous job". Security sources said: "The military has always maintained it operates within legal bounds." But Michael Kugelman and others see a connection between the military's involvement in politics and the amount of space to speak out. "It's intrinsically linked to how strong or weak a democratic government is and what their relationship is with the military," says Munizae Jahangir, a journalist and co-chair for the Human Rights Council of Pakistan (HRCP). "If the military is more dominant, there will be less space for protest, there will be less space for dissent, there will be less space for free expression." Of those already jailed, Mazari is among the most prominent. A lawyer who has worked on some of the most sensitive cases in Pakistan, she and her husband Hadi Ali Chattha were convicted of "disseminating and propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups". The government have defended their sentencing; in response Pakistan's information minister posted on X: "As you sow, so you shall reap!" "Attempts to frame law-breaking as democracy or human rights are entirely misplaced," Chaudhry said. Other human rights advocates told the BBC they have faced limits on how they can operate. HRCP say that their staff have been harassed on phone calls and stopped from holding round-table discussions at hotels unless they obtain permission in advance. The government says this is "to ensure security". Journalists, too, say they have felt pressure. In 2023, the BBC reported that TV channels had been told that they must not show Khan's face, his voice or say his name. The topics that should not be covered, according to journalists the BBC spoke to, have expanded. "They [Pakistan's authorities] have controlled the mainstream media to a large extent," said Azaz Syed, a reporter for Geo TV. He says that even stories tangentially linked to the military – including one he recently did on a defence housing authority – have led to phone calls from unknown numbers with warnings to go no further. Jahangir says she has even been told by editors not to cover certain stories. "The editors are not doing this for fun. They do fundamentally believe in freedom of expression. They are doing this in order to survive," she says. Journalists from other outlets who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity said that a culture of self-censorship was now common in newsrooms. "There were times in the past when there was complete censorship," one said. "Now there is self-censorship, which in many ways is worse because we are deceiving the audience." The BBC approached the military for comment. Security sources told us that ISPR, the military's communications arm, "does not regulate media content, freedom of speech, or interfere in civilian journalism, nor does it exercise any authority over public discourse beyond its lawful communication role". Dawn newspaper - the oldest in Pakistan, founded in 1941 by the country's founding father, Muhammad Ali Jinnah - has taken a financial hit for its reporting. In December, Dawn Media Group said it had been subject to an unannounced ban on government adverts, firstly on its newspaper, then on its TV and radio outlets, a move the Council of Newspaper Editors said was "financially crippling the organisation". "While some within the state may think that punishing outlets that refuse to toe the line may snuff out critical voices, in the modern age this is next to impossible," the editorial board said. Information minister Atta Tarar denied that Dawn was denied government advertisement. Several journalists said that the changes to Pakistan's Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act in early 2025 have made the environment more difficult. Pakistan's authorities introduced the changes, saying they were needed to fight what the military has often termed "digital terrorism"; spreading what they see to be "anarchy and false information" to undermine the state. The country's constitution protects the right to freedom of speech and expression subject to reasonable restrictions, security sources told the BBC. "It's false to claim Pakistan suppresses free speech," says Chaudhry. He cites the dangers of social media being used for financial fraud and recruiting terrorists. "We want to regulate social media, the whole world is regulating [it]." But others say they can be used to limit journalists' ability to report. "Changes made to the law have now made it an explicit crime to criticise the security establishment, the judiciary and definitions around national interest have been made even more vague. There are astonishingly steep fines and the penalties have been enhanced disproportionately," says Adnan Rehmat, a media analyst based in Islamabad. He says there are the official rules, then there are further unspoken rules: "It's really difficult to know what the boundaries are, they are forever shifting." Limitations on journalists are not new in Pakistan. Under Khan's government, journalists protested about restrictions placed on what they could publish and broadcast. Syed sees the current situation as a continuation of the operation against the media. Jahangir also sees some level of historical continuity. "I can't say this has been the worst time, but let's say that times haven't improved for us." While attempts to limit and intimidate critics have happened before, some think there is a new approach this time. "It feels like something has shifted," says Azeema Cheema, an Islamabad-based research director specialising in conflict, fragility and violence. "Because now you are using the courts. You are using institutions, not extra institutional measures." Those operating online outside Pakistan are in the authorities' sights too. In early January, seven Pakistani journalists and Youtubers, including two former army officers, were tried in absentia and given life sentences for digital terrorism. The prosecution accused them of "waging war against state" and "incitement" in relation to protests that took place on 9 May 2023 after Khan's first arrest. In a post on X, one of the sentenced, Adil Raja, said "speaking truth to power is now called Digital Terrorism in Pakistan". Syed and Cheema cite this case as a particularly stark example of harsh sentencing. "There's been a growing realisation that the state is excessively willing and unapologetically willing to wield a blunt hammer," says Cheema. Where that hammer may fall next is what many we spoke to are trying to calculate. Additional reporting by Usman Zahid

Heavy gunfire and blasts heard near airport in Niger's capital Sustained heavy gunfire and loud explosions have been heard in Niger near the international airport outside the capital, Niamey. Multiple eyewitness accounts and videos showed air defence systems apparently engaging unidentified projectiles in the early hours of Thursday. The situation later calmed down, reports say, with an official reportedly saying the situation was now under control, without elaborating. It is not clear what caused the blasts, or if there were any casualties. There has been no official statement from the military government. The gunfire and blasts began shortly after midnight, according to residents of a neighbourhood near the Diori Hamani International Airport, the AFP news agency reports. They said calm returned after two hours. The airport houses an air force base and is located about 10km (six miles) from the presidential palace. One local resident told the BBC that shots had been fired from outside the airport, targeting planes. Others described their fear as they heard the gunshots and explosions. “We didn't sleep last night," said one resident. "Our room and the whole house was shaking from the gunshots and explosions,” she said. "Yesterday was the first time I have ever heard gunfire," another woman said. "We were so scared." Several unconfirmed reports said unknown assailants had thrown explosive devices towards the airport area before exchanging fire with security forces. According to the FlightRadar24 website, several flights bound for Niamey have been diverted. AFP reports there was a heavy security deployment around the airport on Thursday morning. Niger is led by Abdourahamane Tiani who seized power in a 2023 coup that ousted the country's elected civilian president. Like its neighbours Burkina Faso and Mali, the country has been fighting jihadists who have carried out deadly attacks across the region. Early on Thursday morning, supporters of the military government took to the streets of Niamey to show their support for the authorities. The country is a major producer of uranium. A huge uranium shipment destined for export has been stuck at the airport amid unresolved legal and diplomatic complications with France after the military government nationalised the country's uranium mines. "The situation is under control. There is no need to worry," the Anadolu news agency quoted a foreign affairs ministry official as saying, without elaborating. The official told the agency they were trying to determine whether the gunfire was linked to the uranium shipment. Additional reporting by Chris Ewokor

Nicki Minaj calls herself Trump's 'number one fan' and shows off gold card visa Trinidad and Tobago-born rapper Nicki Minaj declared herself to be Donald Trump's "number one fan" on Wednesday, while also showing off her Trump "gold card" visa, which offers applicants residency and a path to US citizenship. The US President called the star up on stage in Washington DC after she announced her support for the so-called "Trump Accounts", which provide trust funds for children. Previously a critic of Trump's hardline immigation policies, Minaj, who came to the US with her parents as a child, has praised his leadership in recent years. "I will say that I am probably the president's number one fan, and that's not going to change," said Minaj, who was seen holding hands with Trump on the podium. "And the hate or what people have to say, it does not affect me at all. It actually motivates me to support him more." She also displayed her new card, emblazoned with Trump's face, in a thread on X with the caption: "Welp." "Finalising that citizenship paperwork as we speak as per my wonderful, gracious, charming president", she later added, noting that the card had come "free of charge". What is a Trump gold card? Allow X content? Trump's gold card was launched in December, as a fast-track for wealthy immigrants like Minaj to get US citizenship. They pay $1 million (£723,650) and a $15,000 (£10,854) processing fee in return for US residency. The scheme has received criticism for arriving at a time when the president is clamping down on illegal immigrants. Super Bass star, Minaj, who has welcomed the move, reportedly explained how she "came to this country as an illegal immigrant at five years old" in a 2018 Facebook post, while criticising the government's family-separation policies. "I can't imagine the horror of being in a strange place and having my parents stripped away from me at the age of five," the post said. "This is so scary to me. Please stop this. Can you try to imagine the terror and panic these kids feel right now? Not knowing if their parents are dead or alive, if they'll ever see them again." In 2024, during a TikTok streaming session, she added: "I'm not a citizen of America. Isn't that crazy? "I was born on a beautiful island called Trinidad and Tobago. But I've been in the States for many years. You would think that with the millions of dollars that I've paid in taxes to this country that I would have been given an honorary citizenship many, many, many thousands of years ago." Minaj's gold card gives her unlimited right of residence in the US, but she is still not a US citizen under the agreement. In the US capital on Wednesday, Trump joked that he would grow out his nails to emulate the rapper, then held her hand while another speaker took the podium. She said she would not let the billionaire president's opponents "get away with bullying him". She added: "He has a lot of force behind him, and God is protecting him. Amen." Sprinsteen's protest song Minaj has faced a bit of a backlash online from her fans over her backing of Trump. Other US musicians have been less complimentary about the president and his immigration policy. In a message shared on social media, the singer-songwriter said his song is in response to "the state terror being visited on the city". "I wrote this song on Saturday, recorded it yesterday and released it to you today..." he said. "It's dedicated to the people of Minneapolis, our innocent immigrant neighbours and in memory of Alex Pretti and Renee Good. Stay free." The folk-rock style protest song, which namechecks both the late Pretti and Good, contains the lyrics: "We'll remember the names of those who died / On the streets of Minneapolis". His fellow New Jerseyan, rapper Ice-T, has been swapping the lyrics to his 1992 track Cop Killer to "ICE killer" during live performances of late. "I think we're headed to some really ugly terrain," he said. "And black people really ain't got nothing to do with it. It's bad. I think the moment somebody shoots an ICE agent, it's gonna get bad." Elsewhere, US singers Billie Eilish, Olivia Rodrigo and Ariana Grande have been among the other stars speaking out. Eilish has made her feelings about ICE and the Trump administration known, criticising ICE raids in her hometown of Los Angeles. After the killing of Renee Nicole Good earlier this month, she shared a post referring to the enforcement agency that has been "tearing apart families, terrorising citizens, and now murdering innocent people". After the subsequent death of Alex Pretti, she posted a selfie with the caption: "Hey my fellow celebrities, u gonna speak up?" Grande got political on social media too, sharing a screenshot of a post from New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani calling for the agency's abolition. "ICE terrorises our cities. ICE puts us all in danger. Abolish ICE," the message read. Additional reporting by Kate Moore.

Ukraine receives 1,000 bodies in latest soldier swap with Russia The bodies of 1,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been returned by Russia, Kyiv has said, in the latest exchange between the warring countries. Russia received 38 bodies in return, Moscow's chief negotiator Vladimir Medinsky said. Medinsky posted a photo on Telegram apparently showing the exchange, with individuals dressed in biohazard suits standing next to a line of white refrigerated trucks used to transport bodies. Kyiv and Moscow have exchanged thousands of soldiers' bodies over the course of the almost four-year conflict. The latest exchange took place under an agreement reached by the two sides during negotiations in Istanbul in 2025. Under that deal, Moscow and Kyiv agreed to return the bodies of 12,000 soldiers, as well as all sick and heavily wounded prisoners of war and those aged under 25. The last swap took place in November last year when Russia returned 1,000 bodies to Ukraine and received 30 in return. There has not been an exchange of prisoners of war since October 2025, with both sides accusing the other of stalling. As the fourth anniversary of the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022 inches closer, efforts at brokering a peace deal between the two countries continue. Last week, Russian, Ukrainian and US negotiators met in the United Arab Emirates for the first trilateral talks since the war began. The negotiations were described by all sides as constructive, but key territorial issues remain unresolved, including Russia's demand that Ukraine give up the 25% of the Donetsk region still under its control. Despite the ongoing negotiations, both sides continue to exchange drone attacks. At least five people were killed in Ukraine's Kharkiv region on Tuesday after a Russian drone struck a passenger train. Russia has intensified its strikes on key infrastructure targets in recent months, leaving many people in Ukraine to face freezing temperatures without heating or power.

**Excerpt**

US Senator Amy Klobuchar announces bid for Minnesota governor Democratic US Senator Amy Klobuchar has said she is running for governor in her home state of Minnesota amid the tumult of an ongoing immigration crackdown. In a video released on Thursday, she called for unity across all parties, billing herself as someone who could heal political divisions and was "willing to find common ground". Her candidacy comes after the incumbent governor, Tim Walz, announced he would end his re-election campaign early amid criticism of his handling of a fraud scandal in the state. Klobuchar, a four-term senator, reportedly delayed her announcement after federal agents fatally shot Alex Pretti on Saturday, two weeks after they also killed another US citizen, Renee Good. These killings and other altercations have put the tactics and use of force by federal agents under intense scrutiny. The operation has become controversial due to these and other violent episodes which have been filmed and shared widely on social media. US President Donald Trump recently pledged to "de-escalate" the operation. Klobuchar will be seen by many pundits as the frontrunner in November's governor contest, as the best-known Democratic figure to declare their candidacy ahead of the primary elections. Republicans, meanwhile, have not won a statewide race since 2006. One Republican contender, Chris Madel, ended his own bid for state governor on Monday, citing the immigration enforcement in his state as an "unmitigated disaster". Referring to recent turmoil in her state, Klobuchar said in her video: "We cannot sugarcoat how hard this is. But in these moments of enormous difficulty, we find strength in our Minnesota values of hard work, freedom, and simple decency and goodwill." Klobuchar also addressed other incidents of violence that have rocked her state in recent months, including the murder of a state lawmaker and her husband, and the deadly shooting of two children inside a church. Political observers suggested that the theme of her message was more centrist, compared with other Democratic candidates who have taken a more combative stance against the Trump administration. Klobuchar did not mention President Donald Trump by name, but referred to the deployment of about 3,000 federal immigration agents "on our streets and in our towns, sent by an administration that relishes division". She also referenced the fraud scandal that led to Walz ending his campaign, saying: "I will make sure the people who steal taxpayer money go to jail and root out the fraud." When announcing he would end his re-election bid, Walz said he would "focus on the work" of governor rather than a campaign. He has also said his government is taking measures to prevent future fraud. In her bio, Klobuchar describes herself as a veteran bipartisan lawmaker willing to work across the aisle. After being sworn into the Senate in her first term in 2007, Klobuchar has risen through the ranks and joined multiple committees, and had a stint as the chairwoman of the Senate Rules Committee.

### 13. [Why China moved so quickly to execute 11 members of a notorious mafia family](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd6wegndnjlo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

Why China moved so quickly to execute 11 members of a notorious mafia family No-one should be surprised that China has swiftly executed the 11 members of a organised crime family from north-eastern Myanmar who were sentenced to death in September. China executes more people than anywhere else in the world, according to human rights groups – the exact figure is a state secret. Officials are often executed for corruption. The accusations made against the Ming family were far more serious. The Ming, Bau, Wei and Liu clans have dominated the remote border town of Laukkaing in Myanmar's impoverished Shan state, since 2009. They rose to power after General Min Aung Hlaing, the current coup leader in Myanmar, led a military operation to drive out the MNDAA, the ethnic insurgent army which had dominated Laukkaing and the area around it since the 1980s. The four families, as they became known, took over and began shifting from the old dependence on opium and methamphetamine production to a new economy based on casinos and, eventually, online fraud. They remained close to the Myanmar military; in December 2021, after seizing power in his coup, Min Aung Hlaing feted Liu Zhengxiang, patriarch of the Liu clan, in the capital Nay Pyi Taw and awarded him an honorary title for "extraordinary contributions to state development". His Fully Light conglomerate had lucrative businesses all over Myanmar. Other members of the four families were candidates for the military-backed party the USDP. The scam compounds they ran in Laukkaing, though, were brutal, much more so than scam complexes in other parts of Asia. Torture was routine. Tens of thousands of mainly Chinese workers were lured there with promises of well-paid jobs, only to find themselves imprisoned in the compounds. They were forced to run elaborate "pig-butchering" scams, where most of the victims were also Chinese. Complaints from the victims, and by the families of those trapped in the compounds multiplied on social media. The most notorious compound in Laukkaing was called Crouching Tiger Villa, run by the Ming family. In October 2023, during what is believed to have been an escape attempt, the guards killed several Chinese nationals. The Chinese authorities felt compelled to take action. With China's apparent blessing the MNDAA and its allies attacked and recaptured Laukkaing, as part of their offensive against the Myanmar army in the ongoing civil war. The MNDAA vowed to stamp out the scam business completely. They detained the heads of the four families and handed more than 60 of their relatives and associates to the Chinese police. Ming Xuechang, the family patriarch, or warlord, killed himself after being captured, authorities said. During interrogations by the Chinese police one of the family members is reported to have admitted killing someone chosen at random just to demonstrate his strength. These details have been publicised by China to justify its tough treatment of the families. Five of the Bau family are also awaiting execution, while the trials of the Wei and Liu families have not yet concluded. The four families are ethnic Chinese, and had close ties to the authorities on the Chinese side of the border in Yunnan. Their abuses were too close to home for China, and the action against the scam business in Laukkaing has been the most decisive yet. China has also prevailed on Thailand and Cambodia to extradite two Chinese business figures accused of running scam empires, She Zhijiang, who built an entire city in Myanmar's war-torn Karen State, and Chen Zhi, who amassed wealth and power with his Prince Group conglomerate in Cambodia. The Chinese government has also brought tens of thousands of its citizens who were working in scam compounds back to China to face trial. The scam business, though, has simply adapted and evolved. It is still thought to be by far the biggest business in Cambodia, despite pressure from China and the US on the government there to shut it down. And it has kept moving to new areas in Myanmar, even as the more prominent scam complexes like KK Park and Shwe Kokko, on the Thai-Myanmar border, have been forced to close down.

### 14. [What could happen if the US strikes Iran? Here are seven scenarios](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce3kenge1k9o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

What could happen if the US strikes Iran? Here are seven scenarios The US appears poised to strike Iran within days. While the potential targets are largely predictable, the outcome is not. So, if no last-minute deal can be reached with Tehran and President Donald Trump decides to order US forces to attack, then what are the possible outcomes? 1. Targeted, surgical strikes, minimal civilian casualties, a transition to democracy US air and naval forces conduct limited, precision strikes targeting military bases of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) and the Basij unit - a paramilitary force under the control of the IRGC - ballistic missile launch and storage sites as well as Iran's nuclear programme. An already weakened regime is toppled, transitioning eventually to a genuine democracy where Iran can rejoin the rest of the world. This is a highly optimistic scenario. Western military intervention in both Iraq and Libya did not bring a smooth transition to democracy. Although it ended brutal dictatorships in both cases, it ushered in years of chaos and bloodshed. Syria, which conducted its own revolution, overthrowing President Bashar Al-Assad without Western military support in 2024, has so far fared better. 2. Regime survives but moderates its policies This could broadly be called the "Venezuelan model" whereby swift, powerful US action leaves the regime intact but with its policies moderated. In Iran's case, this would mean the Islamic Republic survived, which won't satisfy large numbers of Iranians, but is forced to curtail its support for violent militias across the Middle East, cease or curtail its domestic nuclear and ballistic missile programmes as well as easing up on its suppression of protests. Again, this is at the more unlikely end of the scale. The Islamic Republic leadership has remained defiant and resistant to change for 47 years. It appears incapable of changing course now. 3. Regime collapses, replaced by military rule Many think this is the most likely possible outcome. While the regime is clearly unpopular with many, and each successive wave of protests over the years weakens it further, there remains a huge and pervasive security deep state with a vested interest in the status quo. The principal reasons why the protests have so far failed to overthrow the regime is because there have been no significant defections to their side, while those in control are prepared to use unlimited force and brutality to remain in power. In the confusion of the aftermath of any US strikes it is conceivable that Iran ends up being ruled by a strong, military government composed largely of IRGC figures. 4. Iran retaliates by attacking US forces and neighbours It is clearly no match for the might of the US Navy and Air Force but it could still lash out with its arsenal of ballistic missiles and drones, many concealed in caves, underground or in remote mountainsides. There are US bases and facilities dotted along the Arabian side of the Gulf, notably in Bahrain and Qatar, but Iran could also, if it chose, target some of the critical infrastructure of any nation it considered was complicit in a US attack, such as Jordan or Israel. The devastating missile and drone attack on Saudi Aramco's petrochemical facilities in 2019, attributed to an Iranian-backed militia in Iraq, showed the Saudis just how vulnerable they were to Iranian missiles. Iran's Gulf Arab neighbours, all US allies, are understandably extremely jittery right now that any US military action is going to end up rebounding on them. 5. Iran retaliates by laying mines in the Gulf This has long loomed as a potential threat to global shipping and oil supplies ever since the Iran-Iraq war of 1980-88 when Iran did indeed mine the shipping lanes and Royal Navy minesweepers helped clear them. The narrow Strait of Hormuz between Iran and Oman is a critical chokepoint. Around 20% of the world's Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) exports and between 20-25% of oil and oil byproducts pass through this strait each year. Iran has conducted exercises in rapidly deploying sea mines. If it did so then it would inevitably impact world trade and oil prices. 6. Iran retaliates, sinking a US warship A US Navy Captain onboard a warship in the Gulf once told me that one of the threats from Iran he worries about most is a "swarm attack". This is where Iran launches so many high explosive drones and fast torpedo boats at a single or multiple targets that even the US Navy's formidable close-in defences are unable to eliminate all of them in time. The IRGC Navy has long replaced the conventional Iranian Navy in the Gulf, some of whose commanders were even trained at Dartmouth during the time of the Shah. Iran's naval crews have focussed much of their training on unconventional or "asymmetric" warfare, looking at ways to overcome or bypass the technical advantages enjoyed by their primary adversary, the US Navy's Fifth Fleet. The sinking of a US warship, accompanied by the possible capture of survivors among its crew, would be a massive humiliation for the US. While this scenario is thought unlikely, the billion-dollar destroyer the USS Cole was crippled by an Al-Qaeda suicide attack in Aden harbour in 2000, killing 17 US sailors. Before that, in 1987 an Iraqi jet pilot mistakenly fired two Exocet missiles at a US warship, the USS Stark, killing 37 sailors. 7. Regime collapses, replaced by chaos This is a very real danger and is one of the major concerns of neighbours like Qatar and Saudi Arabia. As well as the possibility of a civil war, such as experienced by Syria, Yemen and Libya, there is also the risk that in the chaos and confusion, ethnic tensions could spill over into armed conflict as Kurds, Baluchis and other minorities look to safeguard their own people amid a nationwide power vacuum. Much of the Middle East would certainly be glad to see the back of the Islamic Republic, none more so than Israel which has already dealt heavy blows to Iran's proxies across the region and which fears an existential threat from Iran's suspected nuclear programme. But nobody wants to see the largest Middle East nation by population - around 93 million - descend into chaos, sparking a humanitarian and refugee crisis. The greatest danger now is that President Trump, having amassed this powerful force close to Iran's borders, decides he must act or lose face, and a war begins with no clear end-state and with unpredictable and potentially damaging repercussions.

'I can breathe again' says Israeli hostage held for nearly 500 days in Gaza A former Israeli hostage who was held for nearly 500 days in Gaza says the return of the body of the final hostage this week means all the released captives can "now breathe and start our lives again". Thirty-year-old Sasha Troufanov, an Amazon electronics engineer, was taken hostage on 7 October 2023 by Palestinian Islamic Jihad gunmen. His fiancée Sapir Cohen, mother and grandmother were also kidnapped and taken to Gaza. The women were released after more than 50 days as hostages. He was freed a year ago, after 498 days in captivity. In his first international interview, Troufanov, on a visit to London, told BBC News that with the return on Monday of Ran Gvili's body meaning all the hostages were back "it felt wonderful. We waited so long for this to happen. "I was carrying this burden ever since I came back. It was like a weight on my shoulders that kept me from coming back to my life. Although we were released, we didn't really come out of Gaza because our friends and brothers were still there." But the moment was bittersweet for him as Monday was also the birthday of his father Vitaly. Troufanov only discovered his father had been murdered on 7 October on the day he was released in February 2025 and realised his dad wasn't there to meet him. Troufanov and Cohen had been visiting his family on Kibbutz Nir Oz near the border with Gaza when Palestinian gunmen stormed their homes. Cohen rolled herself up in blanket and hid under the bed but they were both captured. Troufanov was punched and also stabbed in the shoulder. "I saw the terrorist with so much anger and hate in his face, holding his knife trying to stab me even more." As the attackers tried to take Troufanov off the kibbutz he managed to momentarily escape but when he gave up running they still shot him twice in each leg. "I just felt the rush of pain going through my brain and I fell to the ground then one of the terrorists hit me with the rifle from the back of my head and split it open." When he arrived to Gaza, he says he was then beaten by civilians and thought "this is the moment you're going to die". While in Gaza, Troufanov received almost no medical treatment. He was taken once to a family home and once to a hospital where his broken leg was wrapped first with a wooden broom and then with part of a metal grill. Unlike many other hostages, he was held almost entirely in isolation. For only two of the 498 days in captivity did Troufanov see another hostage. At the start he was held above ground, for more than six weeks locked in a cage and given barely enough food to survive. Here, he says he experienced sexual harassment where one guard repeatedly tried to encourage him to do a sexual act on himself. He also says a hidden camera filmed him when he was allowed a shower once a week. "I noticed it and I took the shower trying to avoid my private parts towards this angle, but I had to do it because I needed to shower." Taken underground to the tunnels, Troufanov says he was left for months alone, his captors only bringing food then leaving him in a silent, cramped, humid space so dark he couldn't see his hand in front of his face. "I remember feeling that I am buried underneath the ground while I am still alive. I was losing it. I was having a hard time to find hope in this place. Many times I lost hope completely. I said to myself: 'This is the last place you will see alive.'" It is the first time since 2014 that there are no Israeli hostages held in Gaza. Two hundred and fifty-one people were taken captive during the Hamas-led attack on 7 October 2023, when about 1,200 other people were killed. Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 71,660 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Since the ceasefire began on 10 October 2025, at least 492 Palestinians have been killed, the health ministry says, as well as four Israeli soldiers. Now all the hostages, those alive and those who were killed, have returned to Israel the second phase of US President Donald Trump's plan to end the war in Gaza can commence. The key Rafah border crossing between Egypt and Gaza is set to open on an ongoing basis for the first time since May 2024, as required under the plan. It also envisages the full demilitarisation of Gaza, including the disarmament of Hamas and other Palestinian groups; a technocratic Palestinian government; and the reconstruction of Gaza. Sasha Troufanov believes that these measures aren't enough to ensure an attack like the one on 7 October won't happen again. "Rebuilding Gaza, after what happened in the war, is understandable. But first of all we need to make sure that the people of Gaza will stop trying to hurt Israel. The terrorists were telling me: 'We will do this again and again.' "Rebuilding Gaza and opening the Rafah crossing is in vain as it will never solve the real problem. We need to find a way to make this hatred and encouragement of terrorist activity stop." The former hostage now has to rehabilitate mentally and physically. He is currently on crutches after surgery on his leg but hopes to dance at his wedding to Sapir Cohen in a few weeks. "It's a victory: overcoming hate and fear and saying to ourselves: 'We will build life together and we will continue.'"

Syria's defiant Kurds vow to 'fight until last breath' despite government push As a veteran Syrian Kurdish fighter, Commander Azad – whose nom-de-guerre means freedom - walks with a limp and wears his battle scars with pride. "My leg was injured when we were bombed by a Turkish warplane in 2018," he says. "And this was shrapnel from a suicide bomber," he adds, rolling up his sleeve to reveal a deep gouge in his arm. "My back, abdomen and lower body were all injured in four separate attacks by Daesh," he says, using the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State group (IS). His latest wound is below the surface, and cuts deep – what he sees as betrayal by a former friend, the United States. After IS seized around a third of Syria and Iraq in 2014, the US and the Kurds worked hand in glove to drive them out. Not anymore. "History will hold them accountable," says the commander, who has a handle-bar moustache and wears a green fringed scarf around his neck. "Morally it's not right. But we will keep fighting until our last breath. We are not cry-babies." Their current fight is with the central government in Damascus which wants to extend its control across all of Syria, including the Kurdish autonomous region in the north-east. In the past two weeks government troops have pushed the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) out of resource-rich areas they have controlled for a decade – since defeating IS. As conflict has flared, the White House has strongly backed Syria's interim president, Ahmed al-Sharaa - a former Jihadi. That's a slap in the face for the Kurds. The SDF lost 11,000 fighters battling the jihadis of IS. Commander Azad compares the president to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the late founder of IS. "They are the same thing. After Jolani took over, Syria will always be a war zone," he says, referring to the president by his fighting name, Abu Mohammed Al Jolani. Having fought US troops in Iraq, Al Sharaa set up an al-Qaeda offshoot in Syria, which was in fact fiercely opposed to IS though the groups had similar roots. He later broke with al-Qaeda, then in December 2024 swept to power in Damascus, ousting Bashar al Assad. In the eyes of the Kurds, Al Sharaa is still a Jihadi, but now in a suit. Commander Azad stiffly climbs the stairs to an open rooftop with a commanding view of flat countryside. Below us sheep graze in the fields and clothes flaps on a washing line in a back garden. But a pick-up truck with an anti-aircraft machine gun is parked outside the door, and there is a cluster of troops in camouflage uniforms. This is the SDF's last checkpoint in their stronghold of Hassakeh province. "They [Syrian government forces] are in an Arab village seven kilometres from here," he says, gesturing to the horizon. "So far, there is no danger. I hope there will be no war, but if it comes, 'Let it be welcome,'" he says, quoting Che Guevara, Cuba's revolutionary hero. A fragile ceasefire between the two sides is due to expire on 7 February, but talks are continuing. "We are focusing all our efforts on reaching a permanent ceasefire or a lengthy one," says Siyamend Ali, of the People's Protection Units (YPG), a Kurdish militia that is the backbone of the SDF. "We don't want war, but if we are forced down that path we will fight back. Every neighbourhood will turn into a hell for them." Ali has already seen too many losses in the fight against IS. His fallen friends number in the hundreds. "There were friends I studied with in school and university, and friends I played with. They were from my family and from neighbouring families," says Ali, in a low and weary voice. "They rose to martyrdom. Now I walk in their footsteps." We met at another frontline position - where mounds of dark soil formed fresh defences. If all-out war comes, it will be a losing battle for the Kurds. But there are implications far beyond this corner of Syria. Since the defeat of IS in Syria in 2019, this area has been a holding ground for the remnants of the group's so-called "caliphate". Kurdish-run prisons hold about 8,000 suspected IS fighters, and around 34,000 of their wives and families are detained in camps. Will the gates remain locked if this region becomes a battleground? The Syrian government has taken control of one camp, al-Hol, in eastern Hassakeh. When we visited last October - with an armed escort - we got a hostile reception from veiled women, clad head to toe in black. One ran a finger across her neck, as if slitting a throat. The other main camp, called Roj remains in Kurdish hands. It's home to more than 2,000 foreign women and children, who have been convicted of nothing. Rows of blue and white tents offer little protection from biting winter cold. Children play on a carpet of mud, ringed by fences, walls and watch towers. Roj is a prison in all but name. We returned there this week to find the camp manager Hekmiya Ibrahim increasingly worried. She is slight but determined, a powerhouse in a headscarf. The detainees have been emboldened by the changes beyond the wire, she says. "When news reached them [of the government take-over of al-Hol] everyone immediately came out of their tents, chanting 'Allahu Akbar' [God is greatest]. The sound of their chanting echoed throughout the camp." Taking her phone from her pocket she shows me pictures of the black and white IS flag, newly daubed on one of the walls of the camp. And she recounts threats made to staff. "Statements were directed at us such as 'We will return', 'You are infidels', and 'ISIS will end you,'" she tells us. She warns that some in the camp – even the young – pose a threat to the world. "There was an incident last October involving twin brothers from Turkmenistan," she says. "One killed the other and later said he would do it again if his brother came back to life." The reason – the slain brother was not radical enough. But in the camp's cheerless food market we met women who pointed out that their children are guilty of nothing and pleaded for them to have a normal life. We spoke to two women from North Africa, who did not want to be identified. "I want to leave this place," one woman said, "so my daughter can study and live her life. She has the right to an education, to visit a park, to get medical care. If she's ill, God forbid, she should be able to go to hospital like any other child, without soldiers going with us." When challenged about the fact that they themselves came to join IS, her friend jumped in. "Firstly, I didn't join the organisation," she said. "My husband forced me to come here. He died, and my children and I are paying the price. Our children think the entire world is a camp behind a fence." Forty Britons remain trapped behind that fence – 25 children among them. We came across one of them – a polite boy speaking good English who we cannot identify. He shook hands with one of my BBC's colleagues, and asked, "How are you?" One woman from the UK told us she wanted to go home but was afraid to be interviewed as camp guards were hovering. Two other British women refused to speak, including Shamima Begum, who left London as a schoolgirl to join IS. Camp staff told us Begum was "hiding in her tent". Recalling her decision to come to IS territory, a Bosnian woman broke down and wept. "I feel so bad because I came here with my husband, and I destroyed my life," she said. "I can't explain myself how I was stupid enough to come here. It was a mistake." She says her husband was not radical when they met in college but changed over time. By then they already had a child. Her second child was born in Syria. "We are really worried because we hear stories that there might be a war," she told us. "We really hope they will fix this issue peacefully and that finally we can go back to our countries." As the sands shift in Syria countries that have been willing to leave their citizens in Kurdish camps indefinitely may have to think again – the UK included.

Polar bears on Norwegian islands fatter and healthier despite ice loss, scientists say Scientists expected the opposite, but polar bears in the Norwegian Arctic archipelago of Svalbard have become fatter and healthier since the early 1990s, all while sea ice has steadily declined due to climate change. Polar bears rely on sea ice as a platform from which to hunt the seals that they rely on for blubber-rich meals. The bears' fat reserves provide energy and insulation and allow mothers to produce rich milk for cubs. Researchers weighed and measured 770 adults in Svalbard between 1992 and 2019 and found that bears had become significantly fatter. They think that Svalbard bears have adapted to recent ice loss by eating more land-based prey, including reindeer and walruses. The discovery, published in Scientific Reports, was particularly puzzling because of the impact of climate change in Svalbard. During the same period that this research was carried out, global temperature rise has increased the number of ice-free days per year in the region by almost 100 - at a rate of about four days each year. "The fatter a bear is the better it is," explained lead researcher Dr Jon Aars from the Norwegian Polar Institute. "And I would have expected to see a decline in body condition when the loss of sea ice has been so profound." Walruses have been officially protected in Norway since the 1950s, after they were hunted to near extinction. That protection has boosted their numbers, and apparently provided a new source of fatty food for polar bears. "There are a lot more walruses around [for them to hunt] these days," said Aars. "It is also possible that they are able to hunt seals more efficiently." He explained that, if seals have smaller areas of sea ice available to them, they will congregate in those smaller areas, presenting easier collective pickings for bears. While this is unexpected good news for these Arctic predators, the researchers think it is unlikely to last. As the sea ice continues to decline, bears will have to travel further to access hunting grounds, using more energy and depleting precious fat reserves. The charity Polar Bears International points out that Svalbard's polar bears were some of the most heavily-hunted in the world, until international protections were introduced in the 1970s. Experts think the new findings could be linked to the population recovering from that hunting pressure. That, combined with an increase in the number of walruses - and of reindeer - in recent decades, appears to have provided the bears with a temporary boost. Dr John Whiteman, chief research scientist at PBI said the results were "positive in the short term". "But body condition is only one piece of the puzzle. Other recent research on these bears found that more ice-free days reduced survival in cubs and in subadult and old females." Elsewhere in the Arctic, climate change is having a very different effect on polar bears. There are 20 known sub-populations of polar bears across the Arctic. In Canada's Western Hudson Bay, where the most southerly and best studied bears live, a decline in the population has been directly linked to warming temperatures. Whiteman added that that the long-term picture for polar bears was clear - they need sea ice to survive. "Ice loss ultimately means bear declines, but [this study shows] that the short-term picture can be very region-specific." "In the long term," he told BBC News, "if ice loss continues unchecked, we know the bears will eventually disappear."

Watch: How Alex Pretti shooting led Trump to shift course in Minneapolis The death of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, the second fatal shooting by federal agents there in less than a month, reignited a public outcry at the tactics used in the city's sweeping immigration operation. A growing backlash after the 37-year-old nurse was shot and killed on Saturday prompted a shift in tone from President Donald Trump - who said his administration was going to "de-escalate a little bit". But tensions have been high in Minneapolis for weeks, with frequent protests and confrontations between residents and federal agents. New footage published by the News Movement and shared with BBC News shows an altercation between Pretti and federal officers 11 days before his death. A spokesperson for the family has confirmed the man in the video is Pretti. In a separate statement released to media, the family's lawyer said "nothing that happened a full week before could possibly have justified Alex's killing". BBC analysis editor Ros Atkins examines this new footage - and explains how Trump changed course on Minneapolis. Produced by Katerina Karelli. Verification by Benedict Garman.

**Excerpt**

New Iran videos show bodies piled in hospital and snipers on roofs Verified videos emerging from Iran show bodies piled up in a hospital, snipers stationed on buildings and CCTV cameras being destroyed, following the unprecedented crackdown on protests earlier this month. BBC Verify has been tracking the spread of protests across Iran since they first erupted in late December, but the near total internet blackout imposed by the authorities has made it extremely difficult to document the scale of the state's deadly crackdown on protesters. The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) says it has confirmed the killing of nearly 6,000 people, including 5,633 protesters, since the unrest began at the end of December. It says it is also currently investigating another 17,000 reported deaths received despite an internet shutdown after nearly three weeks. Another group, the Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR), has warned that the final toll could exceed 25,000. Iranian authorities said last week that more than 3,100 people were killed, but that the majority were security personnel or bystanders attacked by "rioters". The latest videos to emerge from the country are understood to have been filmed on 8 and 9 January, when thousands of people took to the streets following a call for nationwide protests from Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the late Shah. They are thought to be the deadliest nights for protesters so far and these newly verified videos show how Iran's security forces have been violently cracking down on protesters. Multiple clips analysed by BBC Verify and BBC Persian show bodies piled up inside a mortuary at Tehranpars hospital in east Tehran. We verified the location of the hospital by matching its interior to other publicly available images and videos of the building, and counted at least 31 bodies in just one video. Another clip shows seven body bags laid on the ground outside the hospital's entrance. Hundreds of people are seen protesting on a highway in west Tehran in another video before multiple rounds of gunfire can be heard and people begin to scream. Protesters have also been seen trying to evade Iran's heavy surveillance infrastructure by disabling CCTV cameras. Footage we verified shows one person in the capital climbing up a post and hitting a surveillance camera several times in an attempt to disable it. A huge crowd of protesters can be seen on the ground and heard cheering as the camera is damaged. We have tracked the spread of the anti-government protests across 71 towns and cities in Iran, though the true number of areas where demonstrations have taken place is likely far higher. In the south-eastern city of Kerman a video taken from high up in a building shows several armed men in military uniform walking down a road firing their weapons continuously, though it is not clear who they are shooting at. A small fire burns in the middle of the road while the sound of protesters chanting can be heard in the background. Snipers have also been recorded on the roofs of buildings. In the north-eastern city of Mashhad verified video shows two men dressed in black on a rooftop of a building in daylight. One man is standing next to a large rifle that is leant against a wall and speaking on the phone. The other man crouches on the floor while smoking. For most people there has been an almost-total internet blackout since 8 January, but some have managed to briefly access the internet using methods such as SpaceX's Starlink satellite internet and virtual private networks (VPNs). More videos are likely to emerge in the coming days as the country's economy has struggled during the blackout. Additional reporting BBC Persian.

'It's 2C in our flat': Inside Kyiv apartment as Russia targets power and heating Russia has been exploiting Ukraine's harshest winter in years to pummel energy infrastructure across the country. Repeated strikes have crippled the power supply to major Ukrainian cities, leaving millions without heating or light as temperatures hover around -15C (5F) for the third week in a row. Electrical companies carry out round-the-clock repairs - only for their work to be undone at night, when Russian drone and missiles again damage power stations. In Kyiv, people were initially able to keep the cold at bay by using electric heaters or wrapping up warm. But the freezing temperatures have lasted weeks now, with no end in sight. Even when power is restored, the supply only lasts a few hours - enough to charge appliances but not to substantially warm up homes, which are gradually becoming inhabitable. The BBC's Abdujalil Abdurasulov visits the apartment of one Kyiv resident to find out what life looks like with no heating and no power. Camera: Matthew Goddard, producer: Paul Pradier
