Nicki Minaj calls herself Trump's 'number one fan' and shows off gold card visa Trinidad and Tobago-born rapper Nicki Minaj declared herself to be Donald Trump's "number one fan" on Wednesday, while also showing off her Trump "gold card" visa, which offers applicants residency and a path to US citizenship. The US President called the star up on stage in Washington DC after she announced her support for the so-called "Trump Accounts", which provide trust funds for children. Previously a critic of Trump's hardline immigation policies, Minaj, who came to the US with her parents as a child, has praised his leadership in recent years. "I will say that I am probably the president's number one fan, and that's not going to change," said Minaj, who was seen holding hands with Trump on the podium. "And the hate or what people have to say, it does not affect me at all. It actually motivates me to support him more." She also displayed her new card, emblazoned with Trump's face, in a thread on X with the caption: "Welp." "Finalising that citizenship paperwork as we speak as per my wonderful, gracious, charming president", she later added, noting that the card had come "free of charge". What is a Trump gold card? Allow X content? Trump's gold card was launched in December, as a fast-track for wealthy immigrants like Minaj to get US citizenship. They pay $1 million (£723,650) and a $15,000 (£10,854) processing fee in return for US residency. The scheme has received criticism for arriving at a time when the president is clamping down on illegal immigrants. Super Bass star, Minaj, who has welcomed the move, reportedly explained how she "came to this country as an illegal immigrant at five years old" in a 2018 Facebook post, while criticising the government's family-separation policies. "I can't imagine the horror of being in a strange place and having my parents stripped away from me at the age of five," the post said. "This is so scary to me. Please stop this. Can you try to imagine the terror and panic these kids feel right now? Not knowing if their parents are dead or alive, if they'll ever see them again." In 2024, during a TikTok streaming session, she added: "I'm not a citizen of America. Isn't that crazy? "I was born on a beautiful island called Trinidad and Tobago. But I've been in the States for many years. You would think that with the millions of dollars that I've paid in taxes to this country that I would have been given an honorary citizenship many, many, many thousands of years ago." Minaj's gold card gives her unlimited right of residence in the US, but she is still not a US citizen under the agreement. In the US capital on Wednesday, Trump joked that he would grow out his nails to emulate the rapper, then held her hand while another speaker took the podium. She said she would not let the billionaire president's opponents "get away with bullying him". She added: "He has a lot of force behind him, and God is protecting him. Amen." Sprinsteen's protest song Minaj has faced a bit of a backlash online from her fans over her backing of Trump. Other US musicians have been less complimentary about the president and his immigration policy. In a message shared on social media, the singer-songwriter said his song is in response to "the state terror being visited on the city". "I wrote this song on Saturday, recorded it yesterday and released it to you today..." he said. "It's dedicated to the people of Minneapolis, our innocent immigrant neighbors and in memory of Alex Pretti and Renee Good. Stay free." The folk-rock style protest song, which namechecks both the late Pretti and Good, contains the lyrics: "We'll remember the names of those who died / On the streets of Minneapolis". His fellow New Jerseyan, rapper Ice-T, has been swapping the lyrics to his 1992 track Cop Killer to "ICE killer" during live performances of late. "I think we're headed to some really ugly terrain," he said. "And black people really ain't got nothing to do with it. It's bad. I think the moment somebody shoots an ICE agent, it's gonna get bad." Elsewhere, US singers Billie Eilish, Olivia Rodrigo and Ariana Grande have been among the other stars speaking out. Eilish has made her feelings about ICE and the Trump administration known, criticising ICE raids in her hometown of Los Angeles. After the killing of Renee Nicole Good earlier this month, she shared a post referring to the enforcement agency that has been "tearing apart families, terrorising citizens, and now murdering innocent people". After the subsequent death of Alex Pretti, she posted a selfie with the caption: "Hey my fellow celebrities, u gonna speak up?" Ariana Grande got political on social media too, sharing a screenshot of a post from New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani calling for the agency's abolition. "ICE terrorises our cities. ICE puts us all in danger. Abolish ICE," the message read. Additional reporting by Kate Moore.

**Excerpt**

Talks ramp up to avert US government shutdown after Minneapolis shooting Talks to avert a US government shutdown have intensified in Washington DC, with officials reportedly moving towards an agreement in negotiations over the Trump administration's immigration enforcement operation. Democrats have been pushing to remove funding for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) from a $1.2tn (£870bn) government spending package following the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Alex Pretti in Minneapolis on Saturday. US media report that the White House and Senate Democratic leadership are nearing an agreement which would meet Democratic demands to introduce new restrictions on federal immigration agents. It would mean five of the six spending bills could be passed before the Friday deadline, while the DHS one would get a short-term extension to allow time for more discussion on the proposed new restrictions, like around the use of masks by agents. If no deal is struck, the second shutdown within months will begin at one minute after midnight on Friday 30 January. How likely is a government shutdown? The spending bill has already passed in the House of Representatives, but needs 60 Senate votes to advance. Among the changes Democrats are seeking are requirements that federal agents obtain warrants before making arrests and clearer rules governing how they identify themselves, according to US media reports. There are only 53 Republican senators in the 100-member body, meaning that passing the bill will require at least some support from Democratic members. Earlier this week, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said: "I will vote no on any legislation that funds ICE until it is reined in and overhauled, and Senate Democrats are overwhelmingly united on this issue." Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune has said that "productive" negotiations are ongoing. If changes are made, the bill will need to be re-approved by the House, which is currently on recess. On Wednesday, some Senate Democrats escalated their demands, expressly calling for DHS Secretary Kristi Noem's removal, and structural changes to both Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and US Border Patrol. "This madness," Schumer said, "this terror must stop." Some Republicans pushed back, with Texas's John Cornyn saying that "any changes must not come at the expense of shutting down the government". What is a 'partial shutdown' and who could be impacted? The entirety of the US federal government will not be impacted by a shutdown if it does occur this weekend. Already, legislation has been passed to fund dozens of agencies through the end of the 2026 fiscal year, which ends on 30 September. Those agencies - including the justice department, FBI and Department of Veterans Affairs - will not be impacted. But other branches are included in the same spending bill as DHS, including the defence department, health and human services, the treasury and the federal court system. In practice, that could mean that a prolonged shutdown could see court operations, medical research disrupted or labour statistics delayed. The Internal Revenue Service is also among the agencies that would be impacted, meaning that tax processing - including refunds - could be affected. DHS is also a sprawling department encompassing multiple agencies, including ICE, the Coast Guard, Secret Service and Customs and Border Protection. Employees that are "essential" to the functioning of impacted agencies would continue to work, but will not be paid until funding is restored - unless the government finds other sources - as Trump did with military personnel last year. How long was the last shutdown? The most recent shutdown in the latter half of 2025 lasted 43 days between 1 October and 12 November, making it the longest in US history. Democrats had initially refused to support the funding bill, demanding that Republicans agree to extend health insurance subsidies for low-income Americans that are set to expire at the end of the year. Eventually, eight Democrats broke with their party colleagues and helped pass the bill. That shutdown left around 1.4 million federal employees on unpaid leave or working without pay. Food aid was also left in limbo, and air travel was severely disrupted across the US. There have been a total of 16 government shutdowns since 1981, although some only lasted days.

Flights to northern Ethiopia cancelled as fears mount of renewed conflict Passenger flights between Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa, and cities in the northern Tigray region have been cancelled amid fears of a return to conflict, with reports of clashes in one area. Ethiopia Airlines, which operates all routes in the country, sent passengers a text message about the cancellations citing "unplanned circumstances". Neither the airline nor the government has commented further. Airport staff in Tigray's main city of Mekelle have reportedly been told not to go to work. A 2022 peace deal to end a brutal civil war in Tigray has been unravelling as tensions grow over disputed territory and ahead of June's elections. There are reports of clashes between the federal army and Tigray fighters in Mai Degusha, a contested area of Tselemti district in western Tigray. During the conflict, forces from the neighbouring Amhara region occupied the fertile area of western Tigray, which remains a source of dispute. The government has said it will be settled through a referendum but around a million people fled that area during the war and remain in poor conditions in makeshift camps throughout Tigray - and it is not clear whether they will get a vote. Sources also report new military movements in southern Tigray, raising concerns of renewed conflict. Ethiopian Airlines has not yet issued an official statement or explanation regarding the suspension of its flights. The African Union (AU) brokered the truce between the government and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) - known as the Pretoria Agreement - which set up an interim administration to run Tigray. Tigray's transport chief Tadele Mengistu confirmed to the BBC that flights had been cancelled but said he did not have detailed information about the reasons behind the decision. Buses are still operating between Addis Ababa and Tigray, though they may be subject to disruptions following the suspension of flights. Relations between the TPLF and the government have been deteriorating for a while. Following the Pretoria deal, the TPLF, which was designated a terrorist group during the war, wanted its legal status as a political party to be reinstated. But the process has been dogged by disagreements and the electoral board recently revoked the TPLF's licence - meaning it cannot contest the national elections in June. The TPLF itself has split into factions, complicating an already tense situation. The party had dominated Ethiopia's political landscape for two decades until Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed came to power in 2018 and set up a new party, which TPLF leaders refused to join. An AU envoy estimated that 600,000 people were killed during the Tigray war with all sides accused of gross abuses, such as the mass killing of civilians and widespread sexual violence.

Panic on crowded Ukraine train - passenger describes moment of Russian drone strike A Ukrainian soldier has described the moment a passenger train was targeted by Russian drones, killing five people. When a carriage on the train was hit in northeastern Ukraine, passengers threw themselves on the floor in panic and the military officer told them to get out immediately. Without his instruction, issued moments before the carriage burst into flames, many more passengers could have died. The officer, whose army call-sign is Omar, is part of Ukraine's 93rd brigade. He was among the passengers travelling on a route from Chop, on the border with Slovakia, to Barvinkove, the last stop before the front line in eastern Ukraine. The first of three Russian drones landed near the train, forcing it to come to a halt. "Then we heard the rumble of another drone, and then an explosion," Omar tells the BBC. "The blast was so strong that parts of the carriage shattered into splinters." As the commander of a drone unit, he quickly realised he and the other passengers had to get out as the train could get hit again. In all, 291 people were on the train at the time, officials say. "After the second hit, I understood that the drone operator was observing what kind of target it was hitting," Omar says, and a stationary train was an easy target. The carriage that suffered a direct hit quickly became engulfed in flames. "I am in the military and I am prepared for such attacks," says Omar. "But for others it was a shock to be so close to death." Many passengers evacuated the train in a state of deep distress, and videos from the scene show people screaming and crying as they move away from the smouldering wreck. It was too dangerous for such a large number of people to stay near the burning carriages, so he urged them to start moving towards a nearby motorway. He then went back to the train with some of the other passengers to check if anyone had been left behind. Inspecting the carriages, he saw a body and continued to look for survivors. Five people lost their lives in the attack. In the final carriage, Omar found a young woman with a baby. "She was very scared and had no idea what to do but thank God she was alive," he says. She barely had time to put on warm clothes, and screamed she needed to go back to the carriage to retrieve her suitcase and documents, the officer says. "I came here to bring my son," she told Omar as she was getting off the train. Later, Omar understood she had been travelling to the front line so that her soldier husband could see their child. The attack on the passenger train in Kharkiv region was condemned by President Volodymyr Zelensky as terrorism. It hit the heart of the railway system - a symbol of resilience in a country where the airspace has been closed since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022. Millions of Ukrainians rely on the 21,000km-long (13,000-mile) railway network to travel around the country and to cross the border into neighbouring countries, from which they can then catch flights. Although the railways have been targeted in the past, by and large Ukraine's Ukrzaliznytsia rail company has been able to keep people moving on its vast network - although escalating attacks on infrastructure and severe weather have led to increasingly long delays. Trains to the frontline city of Kramatorsk in the Donetsk region were eventually suspended last autumn, once the area became too dangerous due to sustained aerial Russian attacks. On Wednesday, flags flew at half-mast in railway stations across Ukraine. The daily minute of silence observed across the country was dedicated to the victims of the drone strike on the train. Hours after the attack had taken place, services were running again on the Barvinkove-Chop line.

### 5. [Why an India court ruling on a 2018 deal is rattling foreign investors](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz9v42ep8n0o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

Why an India court ruling on a 2018 deal is rattling foreign investors Foreign investors and private equity firms operating in India are making anxious calls to advisers and lawyers after a Supreme Court ruling earlier this month strengthened the government's hand in tax disputes. On 15 January, India's top court ruled that US investment firm Tiger Global must pay tax in India on the sale of its stake in e-commerce giant Flipkart to Walmart in 2018. The 152-page judgment overturned a 2024 Delhi high court decision that had allowed Tiger Global to claim tax relief under a decades-old India–Mauritius tax treaty. The ruling, which could reshape how foreign investors exit their Indian investments, sets out a tougher interpretation of tax treaties. It allows authorities to deny treaty benefits if offshore investment structures are deemed to be sham entities with little commercial substance - even when investors hold valid documentation. The judgement gives India wide powers to scrutinise any offshore corporate deal. But experts warn it could unsettle international investors and hurt business sentiment. Some lawyers who wanted to remain unnamed told the BBC that their clients were worried that the ruling could lead to scrutiny of old transactions and share sales long thought to be settled. "The judgment opens up unjustifiable windows for tax authorities to scrutinise any offshore corporate deal," says Ketan Dalal, managing director of Katalyst Advisors. "This can undermine policy stability and certainty, which are critical for doing business in India." The Tiger Global case dates to 2018, when US retail giant Walmart bought Flipkart in one of the largest e-commerce deals of the time. Tiger Global, which invested through three Mauritius-based entities, sold its entire 17% stake for about $1.6bn (£1.19bn). The transaction initially drew attention as a landmark foreign exit from India's e-commerce sector - before becoming one of the country's most closely watched tax disputes. Tiger Global argued that its gains were shielded from Indian tax because the investment was held through entities in Mauritius, invoking a long-standing tax treaty between the two countries. It relied on tax residency certificates issued by Mauritius, which had traditionally been accepted as sufficient proof to claim treaty benefits. Delhi had changed tax rules in 2016, making gains from the sale of Indian shares taxable even under treaties. Investments made before 1 April 2017, however, were exempted. Tiger Global said its Flipkart investments predated the change and, therefore, qualified for the exemption. Indian tax authorities rejected the claim and argued that the Mauritian firms served as conduits and were used only to avoid taxes, with no real business purpose. The Supreme Court has now sided with Indian officials, ruling that tax certificates alone do not guarantee treaty benefits and that the investment structure lacked real commercial substance. It held that foreign investors cannot rely on complex offshore set-ups when those entities don't carry out genuine business activities of their own. JB Pardiwala, one of the two judges, wrote: "Taxing an income arising out of its own country is an inherent sovereign right. Any dilution of this is a threat to a nation's long-term interest." The exact tax and penalty bill for Tiger Global depends on its profit from the deal and is not yet known. Tiger Global did not respond to the BBC's questions. The ruling has raised concerns around future sales of investments for private equity funds or foreign direct investment routed through the island nation. It also has wider ramifications since India and Mauritius signed a protocol in 2024 amending their tax treaty to benefit only companies with legetimate businesses and not shell companies set up to avoid tax, says Fereshte Sethna, a tax lawyer and senior partner at DMD Advocates. The protocol has yet to come into force and will apply to future deals. India had long tried to attract foreign capital by encouraging investments from companies with structures in countries such as Mauritius, Singapore and the Netherlands, signing treaties to help investors avoid paying taxes twice. It worked. Between 2000 and March 2025, Mauritius alone accounted for about $180bn (£133.9bn), nearly a quarter of all foreign direct investment into India, according to official figures. It prompted India to tighten tax laws from 2016. The recent Supreme Court ruling further strengthens the tax authority's hand if it can prove that companies have set up offshore entities only to avoid tax. While tax experts say the court has applied the law as it is written, they warn it creates new uncertainty. It challenges the government's earlier promises to safeguard pre-2017 deals routed through places like Mauritius. The core issue is the credibility of a sovereign's commitments and trust in its tax regime, Dalal says. If the government promised protection for investments made before 2017, then this ruling could be seen as undoing that promise, says Sethna, who appeared on behalf of Vodafone in India's longest-running tax litigations in the past decade. India's battle with the British telecom giant over a $2bn tax claim lasted years and ultimately reshaped how the country taxes cross-border transactions, even prompting a controversial retrospective tax change. Vodafone eventually won the dispute. A lawyer currently advising some private equity sales told the BBC that after the Tiger Global ruling, all deal valuations and calculations will have to be redone in case they are scrutinised by tax authorities. Due diligence and paperwork will increase. "All pre-2017 investments they thought would not attract tax are now at high risk of scrutiny," he says, declining to be named owing to the sensitivity of his clients. Tax advisers say the ruling has shaken confidence. Amit Maheshwari, a tax partner at AKM Global, a consulting firm with a focus on cross-border transactions, says firms advised clients based on the law of the land at the time, but now see settled positions being reopened years later. He warns this reversal creates deep uncertainty. India has long been a top destination for investors, looking to gain from its fast-growing consumer base, but it has also faced criticism for policy shifts and drawn-out tax battles. Analysts worry the new ruling could further slow money coming into the country as investors reassess how they invest and which routes are still safe - at a time when global trade tensions and geopolitical risks are already weakening on fund flows.
