Venezuela swears in interim president after defiant Maduro pleads not guilty in US court Delcy Rodriguez has been sworn in as Venezuela's interim president in a parliamentary session that began with demands for the release from US custody of ousted leader Nicolas Maduro. Rodriguez, 56, vice president since 2018, said she was pained by what she called the "kidnapping" of Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores who were seized by US forces in an overnight raid on Saturday. In dramatic scenes inside a New York court room two hours earlier, Maduro insisted he was still the president of Venezuela as he pleaded not guilty to four charges of drug trafficking and terrorism. Meanwhile the US faced sharp criticism at the UN, but the US ambassador said the largest energy reserves in the world could not be left in the hands of an illegitimate leader, a "fugitive from justice". Before the court appearance, the UN Security Council held an emergency session to discuss the situation in Venezuela. The ambassador for Venezuela, Samuel Moncada, said his country had been the target of an "illegitimate armed attack lacking any legal justification". The US ambassador to the UN, Mike Waltz, justified the attack by describing Maduro as "an illegitimate so-called president". Waltz added that the US had carried out a "surgical law enforcement operation" to apprehend Maduro, whom he is also referred to as a "fugitive from justice". Maduro has been accused of narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine importation conspiracy, possession of machine guns and destructive devices and conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices. During Monday afternoon's court appearance, a member of the public began to yell in Spanish at Maduro that he would "pay" for what he had done. Maduro turned to him and replied that he was a "kidnapped president" and a "prisoner of war" before being escorted out in shackles behind his wife through the back court door. "I'm a decent man. I am still president of my country," Maduro said earlier during the 30-minute hearing. Judge Alvin Hellerstein, 92, interjected to tell Maduro that there would be a "time and a place to get into all of this". Speaking just hours after Saturday's attack - which saw over 150 aircraft and 200 US personnel enter Venezuela - Trump had vowed the US would "run" Venezuela until "a safe and proper and judicious transition" was possible. He also promised US oil companies would move into the country to fix infrastructure "and start making money for the country". But despite the US president's claims, Maduro's allies remain in charge. In comments made to the US magazine The Atlantic on Sunday once it became clear Rodriguez would be sworn in, Trump warned she could "pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro" if she "doesn't do what's right". During a cabinet meeting, Rodriguez indicated her government would engage in some cooperation with the US, saying: "We invite the US government to collaborate with us on an agenda of co-operation orientated towards shared development within the framework of international law." Thousands of Venezuelans gathered outside the Federal Legislative Palace to show support for Maduro, his wife and the interim president Rodriguez as she was sworn in. Speaking after taking her oath, Rodriguez told the National Assembly she did so "with pain" because of the suffering caused by "illegitimate military aggression". She vowed to guarantee the peace of the country, "the spiritual tranquillity of our people, the economic and social tranquillity of our people". The assembly also heard from Maduro's son who expressed his support for his parents - saying that they "will return" to Venezuela. He also offered his "unconditional support" to Rodriguez. The next court hearing in Maduro's case has been scheduled for 17 March.

'I'm a prisoner of war' - In the room for Maduro's dramatic court hearing The sound of clanking leg shackles could be heard moments before Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro walked into the door of a New York City courtroom for the first time. He then told packed rows of reporters and the public that he had just been "kidnapped". Minutes after his entrance, the Judge Alvin Hellerstein asked Maduro to confirm his identity so the proceedings could start. "I am, sir, Nicolás Maduro. I am president of the Republic of Venezuela and I am here kidnapped since January 3rd," he told the court in a calm Spanish before an interpreter translated for the court. "I was captured at my home in Caracas, Venezuela." The 92-year-old judge quickly interjected to tell Maduro that there would be a "time and a place to get into all of this". During the dramatic 40-minute arraignment on Monday afternoon, Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, pleaded not guilty to drugs and weapon charges. "I'm innocent. I'm a decent man," Maduro said, with Flores adding that she was "completely innocent". The 63-year-old and his wife were transferred to a New York jail after they were arrested by US forces at their compound in Venezuela on Saturday, as part of a surprise overnight operation that also saw strikes on military bases. Dressed in blue and orange jail shirts and khaki pants, the two wore headphones to listen to a Spanish translation during the hearing, an attorney sitting between them. Maduro took meticulous notes on a yellow legal pad that he asked a judge to confirm that he could keep with him after the hearing. When Maduro walked into the room - the same federal courtroom where Sean "Diddy" Combs was tried and convicted just months earlier - he turned around to nod at several members of the audience and greet them. He maintained this calm and expressionless demeanour during the proceedings, even at the end, when a man watching from the public area suddenly shouted that Maduro would "pay" for his crimes. "I'm a president and prisoner of war," he shouted towards the man in the audience in Spanish. The man was then escorted out of the room in tears. The proceedings were emotional for others in the court as well. Maibort Petit, a reporter from Venezuela who has covered Maduro's administration, said the US missile strikes during Maduro's arrest damaged her family home near Fuerte Tiuna in Caracas. She said it was surreal to watch her former leader escorted into court in prison garb by US marshals. Maduro's wife, Flores, was much quieter, with bandages near her eyes and forehead for injuries her lawyers said she sustained during their weekend arrest. She spoke softly with her blonde hair tied back in a bun while her lawyers asked that she be given proper medical treatment, including an xray of potentially bruised ribs and a fracture. Maduro and his wife did not seek bail during the proceedings, but can do so at a later date, meaning they will remain in federal custody. The US has accused Maduro of narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine importation conspiracy, possession of machine guns and destructive devices and conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices. Maduro was charged alongside his wife, son and several others. The next court hearing in the case has been scheduled for 17 March.

All 116 injured in Swiss ski resort fire identified All 116 people injured in a bar fire at a Swiss ski resort have now been identified, officials have said. Forty people were killed when a fire tore through a busy venue in Crans-Montana on New Year's Eve, with victims' age ranging from 14 to 39 years old. While the dead had all previously been identified, work had been ongoing to establish who the injured are, some of whom remain in a critical condition. Swiss police confirmed on Monday that 83 people remained in hospital, with the injured including at least 12 nationalities. Most of the injured suffered severe burns, which in some cases meant they could not be identified, police have said. Investigators said 119 people had been injured but that number has been revised down in the latest update. A criminal investigation has been launched into the French couple who managed the Le Constellation bar - a venue known to be popular with a younger crowd in the ski resort town, where the drinking age is 16. Sparklers on bottles being carried too close to the ceiling were the likely cause of the fire, a preliminary investigation has found. Beatrice Pilloud, Valais canton lead prosecutor, said in a statement that investigators were looking into whether the acoustic foam on the venue's ceiling was "the cause of the problem", as well as "whether it complies with regulations". Details have begun to emerge about some of those who lost their lives in the tragedy. Among them was Charlotte Niddam, believed to be 15, who was a pupil at two UK schools. Her family wrote on social media: "It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of our beautiful daughter and sister Charlotte." The mother of Arthur Brodard, 16, confirmed he had died in the fire. She said in a video message: "We can start our mourning, knowing that he is in peace and in the light." Italian media named junior golfer Emanuele Galeppini, 16, as also being among the victims. Italian Golf Federation paying tribute to the "young athlete who carried with him passion and authentic values".

**Excerpt**

South Korea's Lee Jae Myung meets China's Xi as he seeks to reset ties South Korea's President Lee Jae Myung is meeting Chinese leader Xi Jinping as he seeks to reset frayed ties with his country's biggest trading partner. Regional security and Beijing's unofficial ban on Korean pop culture are also on the agenda for Monday's meeting, which is their second summit since November, when Xi visited South Korea. Given what a vital economic partner China is, experts say Lee is looking for assurances that it would not weaponise that relationship in the face of political tensions in the region. For weeks, China and Japan have been engaged in a diplomatic row over the former's claim on self-governed Taiwan, which puts Seoul, a key regional power, in an awkward spot. Beijing ramped up the rhetoric against Japan after its prime minister Sanae Takaichi suggested in parliament that Tokyo could respond with its own self defence force in case of a Chinese attack on Taiwan. So visiting Beijing at this time is a significant move for Lee. Like Japan, South Korea too is an ally of the US, which supports Taiwan and supplies arms for its defence. Xi is expected to hold a welcoming ceremony for Lee in Beijing's Great Hall of the People, state-run CCTV reports. Lee, who arrived in Beijing on Sunday, will then meet China's Premier Li Qiang and the chairman of parliament, Zhao Leji, before flying to Shanghai. Speaking before Korean residents in Beijing on Sunday, Lee said his visit would "serve as a new starting point to fill in the gaps in Korea-China relations, restore them to normal and upgrade them to a new level". This is the first visit by a South Korean leader since 2019. The relationship soured under Lee's predecessor, impeached ex-president Yoon Suk Yeol, who was very critical of China. On the other side, Xi's eagerness to meet Lee signals the pressure he faces in finding a regional ally, Park Seung-chan, professor of China studies at Yongin University told the BBC. "China may beat around the bush but its demand is clear: side with China and denounce Japan." Beijing has been leveraging the two countries' shared history of fighting against Japan during the 20th Century, Mr Park said. Lee is expected to hold a memorial service in Shanghai for activists who fought for Korea's independence from Japan. While Korea is "still showing all its deference towards China", it wants to "strengthen its relationships with both Japan and China", Mr Park added. Seoul has long walked a diplomatic tightrope between Beijing and Tokyo. Lee is reportedly planning to visit Japan later this month to meet Takaichi. And on Friday, South Korea's national security director Wi Sung-lac told reporters the country "respects the One China policy" - the diplomatic acknowledgment that Beijing is the only Chinese government. Security on the Korean Peninsula will also be part of the discussions with China, Wi told reporters. Lee has sought to engage North Korea diplomatically, but there has been little progress so far. He needs Chinese cooperation in pressuring the North's Kim Jong Un to give up his nuclear weapons. Beijing is the dictator's biggest supporter, economically and diplomatically, Russia aside. "China is a very important cooperative partner in moving toward peace and unification on the Korean Peninsula," Lee said on Sunday. Earlier in the day Seoul's military said Pyongyang fired ballistic missiles off its east coast. And on Monday the North's state news agency said the country test-fired hypersonic missiles to assess deterrence capabilities following recent developments, a reference to the US's capture of Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro over the weekend. It remains unclear how much Lee will be able to push China on North Korea. In September, Xi had pledged to strengthen Beijing's "traditional friendship" with Pyongyang. And Seoul and Beijing are not natural allies. US troops have been stationed in South Korea for decades in case of an attack from the North, and last year the two sides agreed to cooperate on building nuclear-powered submarines. The announcement drew warnings from China. There are other sore spots, such as China's unofficial restrictions on South Korean music and dramas that have been in place for a decade. K-pop and K-dramas are either unavailable or difficult to access on Chinese media platforms. While China has never acknowledged a ban on Korean artists, it's believed to be a protest against South Korea's decision to deploy a US anti-missile system in 2016, which China sees as a threat to its military operations in the region. Persuading Beijing to lift these restrictions is said to be high on Lee's agenda. China is a massive market for Korean entertainment, which is already a huge global success. Lee will also be seeking to put a stop to China's build-up of maritime structures in waters between the two countries. Beijing says the structures are fish-farming equipment, but they have sparked security concerns in Seoul.

'We need Greenland': Trump repeats threat to annex Danish territory Donald Trump has again proposed annexing Greenland, after Denmark's leader urged him to "stop the threats" over the island. Speaking to reporters, the US president said "we need Greenland from the standpoint of national security". Trump has repeatedly raised the prospect of the semi-autonomous Danish territory becoming an annexed part of the US, citing its strategic location for defence purposes and mineral wealth. Greenland's Prime Minister Jens Frederik Nielsen responded by saying "that's enough now" and described the notion of US control over the island as a "fantasy". He said: "No more pressure. No more insinuations. No more fantasies of annexation. We are open to dialogue. We are open to discussions. But this must happen through the proper channels and with respect for international law." Earlier, Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen had said "the US has no right to annex any of the three nations in the Danish kingdom". Frederiksen added that Denmark "and thus Greenland" was a Nato member and covered by the alliance's security guarantee, and said a defence agreement granting the US access to the island was already in place. The Danish prime minister released her statement after Katie Miller - the wife of one of Trump's senior aides, Stephen Miller - posted on social media a map of Greenland in the colours of the American flag alongside the word "SOON". The Danish ambassador to the US responded to the post by Miller - a right-wing podcaster and former aide to Trump during his first term - with a "friendly reminder" that the two countries were allies and saying Denmark expected respect for its territorial integrity. The back and forth over the future Greenland comes in the wake of a major military operation against Venezuela on Saturday, seizing its president Nicolás Maduro and his wife and removing them to New York. Trump later said the US would "run" Venezuela and US oil companies would "start making money for the country". The situation has reignited fears that the US may consider using force to secure control of Greenland, a vast island in the Arctic - something the US president has previously refused to rule out. Trump has claimed that making it part of the United States would serve American security interests due to its strategic location and its abundance of minerals critical to high-tech sectors. The Trump administration's recent move to appoint a special envoy to Greenland prompted anger in Denmark. Greenland, which has a population of 57,000 people, has had extensive self-government since 1979, though defence and foreign policy remain in Danish hands. While most Greenlanders favour eventual independence from Denmark, opinion polls show overwhelming opposition to becoming part of the US. In comments to the BBC, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said that only Denmark and Greenland could decide the territory's fate. "Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark must decide the future of Greenland, and only Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark," he said. Separately, a representative for the European Union has rejected a claim by Trump that the EU "needs" the US to control the territory. Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One at the weekend that "the EU needs us to have [Greenland] and they know that." European Commission chief spokesperson Paula Pinho told the BBC that it was "certainly not" the EU's position, adding that she was unaware of any discussions with the US about the issue.

**Excerpt**

Cuba defiant as it braces for post-Maduro era After Venezuela, there is no nation in the Americas more affected by the events in Caracas than Cuba. The two nations have shared a political vision of state-led socialism since a fresh-faced Venezuelan presidential candidate, Hugo Chávez, met the aged leader of the Cuban Revolution, Fidel Castro, on the tarmac at Havana airport in 1999. For years, their mutual ties only deepened, as Venezuelan crude oil flowed to the communist-run island in exchange for Cuban doctors and medics travelling in the other direction. After the deaths of the two men, it was Nicolás Maduro - trained and instructed in Cuba - who became Chávez's handpicked successor, chosen partly because he was acceptable to the Castro brothers. He represented continuity for the Cuban revolution as much as the Venezuelan one. Now he, too, is gone from the seat of power in Caracas, forcibly removed by the US's elite Delta Force team. The prospects for Cuba in his absence are bleak. For now, the Cuban government has robustly denounced the attack as illegal and declared two days of national mourning for 32 Cuban nationals killed in the US military operation. Their deaths revealed a key fact long-known about Cuban influence over the Venezuelan presidency and military: Maduro's security detail was almost entirely made up of Cuban bodyguards. Cuban nationals are in place in numerous positions in Venezuela's intelligence services and military too. Cuba had long denied having active soldiers or security agents inside Venezuela, but freed political prisoners have often claimed they were interrogated by men with Cuban accents while in custody. Furthermore, despite endless public proclamations of solidarity between the two nations, in truth the Cuban influence behind the scenes of the Venezuelan state is believed to have driven a wedge between ministers most-closely aligned with Havana and those who feel that the relationship first established by Chávez and Castro has become fundamentally unbalanced. In essence, that faction considers that these days Venezuela gets little in return for its oil. Venezuela is believed to send around 35,000 barrels of oil a day to Cuba - none of the island's other main energy partners, Russia and Mexico, even come close. The Trump administration's tactic of confiscating sanctioned Venezuelan oil tankers has already begun to worsen the fuel and electricity crisis in Cuba and has the potential to become very acute, very quickly. At best, the future looks increasingly complex for the beleaguered Caribbean island without Maduro at the helm in Caracas. Cuba was already in the grip of its worst economic crisis since the Cold War. There have been rolling blackouts from end to end of the island for months. And the impact on ordinary Cubans has been taxing in the extreme: weeks without reliable electricity, food rotting in fridges, fans and air-conditioning not running, mosquitoes swarming in the heat and the fester of uncollected rubbish. The island has experienced a widespread outbreak of mosquito-borne diseases in recent weeks with huge numbers of people affected by dengue fever and chikungunya. Cuba's healthcare system, once the jewel in the revolution's crown, has struggled to cope. It is not a pretty picture. Yet it is the daily reality for most Cubans. The idea that the flow of Venezuelan oil to Cuba could be turned off by Delcy Rodríguez fills Cubans with dread, especially if she looks to placate the Trump administration following the US raid against her predecessor and stave off the spectre of more violence. President Trump insists Washington is calling the shots in Venezuela now. While those comments were walked back - to an extent - by his Secretary of State Marco Rubio, there is no doubt that the Trump administration now expects nothing less than total compliance from Rodríguez as acting president. There would be further, potentially worse consequences, Trump threatened, if she "doesn't behave", as he put it. Such language - not to mention the US operation in Venezuela itself - has shocked and angered Washington's critics, who say the White House is guilty of the worst form of US imperialism and interventionism seen in Latin America since the Cold War. The removal of Maduro from power amounted to kidnapping, those critics argue, and the case against him must be thrown out at his eventual trial in New York. Unsurprisingly, Trump appears unfazed by such arguments, warning he might even carry it out again in against the president of Colombia if need be. He has dubbed the worrying new circumstances in Latin America the "Donroe Doctrine", in a nod to the Monroe Doctrine - a 19th Century colonialist foreign policy principle which warned European powers against meddling in the US sphere of influence in the Western hemisphere. In order words, Latin America is the US's "backyard", and Washington has the unalienable right to determine what happens there. Rubio used that very term - backyard - about the region as he justified the actions against Venezuela on US Sunday talk shows. He also remains key to what comes next for Cuba. The US economic embargo has been in place for more than six decades and failed to remove the Castro brothers or their political project from power. Rubio - a Cuban American former Florida senator and son of Cuban exiles - would like nothing more than to be the man, or the man behind the man, who brought an end to 60 years of communist rule in his parents' homeland. He sees the strategy of removing Maduro and laying down stark conditions to a more-compliant Rodríguez government in Caracas as the key to achieving that self-professed goal in Havana. Cuba has faced tough times in the past, and the government remains defiant in the face of this latest act of US military intervention in the region. The 32 "brave Cuban combatants" who died in Venezuela would be honoured, said Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel, for "taking on the terrorists in imperial uniforms". "Cuba is ready to fall," retorted Trump on Air Force One.

**Excerpt**

US sharply criticised by foes and friends over Maduro seizure The US seizing of Venezuela's leader has faced strong criticism from both America's friends and foes at an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council. Many member states agreed with the US that Nicolás Maduro had been an illegitimate and repressive leader. But many also condemned the US military action as a breach of international law and the UN Charter, and they demanded a democratic transition that reflected the will of the Venezuelan people. Among US allies, France was by far the most outspoken. The deputy ambassador, Jay Dharmadhikari, said Maduro's taking by the US runs "counter to the principle of peaceful dispute resolution and runs counter to the principle of the non-use of force". He told the Council: "The proliferation of violations of the Charter of the UN and the violations of international law by states vested with responsibility as permanent members of Security Council chips away at the very foundation of the international order, contravening the principles of the charter, including the principle of respect for independence and territorial integrity of states, undermines the foundation of the UN and weakens international peace and security." The deputy UN ambassador for Denmark, Sandra Jensen Landi, voiced her country's "deep concern" at the evolving situation and said: "These developments constitute a dangerous precedent. International law and the UN Charter… must be respected." Both these statements – by France and Denmark - represent a significant stiffening of European criticism of the seizing of Maduro after some initial equivocation by many EU members. In contrast, both UK and Greek diplomats at the UN did not condemn the US military operation. The ambassador for Panama, Eloy Alfaro de Alba, expressed concern about US plans to work with the existing regime, without involving the opposition or holding fresh elections. He told the Council: "Any attempt to establish a permanent government headed by a figure from the repressive apparatus such as Delcy Rodriguez would constitute continuity of the system and not a genuine transition." Colombia's ambassador Leonor Zalabata Torres said there is no justification for the unilateral use of force to commit an act of aggression: "Such actions constitute a serious violation of international law and the UN Charter." Russia's ambassador, Vassili Nebenzia, accused the US of "international banditry" and "neo-colonialism and imperialism". He said there was no justification for "US domination by force" and accused US allies of hypocrisy and double standards for failing to criticise Trump. China's Chargé d'Affaires, Sun Lei, said Beijing was "deeply shocked and strongly condemned" what he called the "unilateral, illegal and bullying acts of the US". In a statement read out on his behalf, Antonio Guterres, the UN Secretary General, said he remained "deeply concerned that rules of international law have not been respected" during the US action: "The power of the law must prevail." By contrast, the acting UK ambassador, James Kariuki, gave a very brief statement, saying merely the UK wanted to see a "safe and peaceful transition to a legitimate government that reflects the will of the Venezuelan people". He added, without being specific, that the UK "reaffirms its commitment to international law and the principles enshrined in the charter of the UN". Greece's deputy ambassador, Ioannis Stamatekos, also failed to condemn Trump's seizure of Maduro, calling instead for "dialogue and diplomacy" to resolve the crisis. For the US, UN ambassador Mike Waltz said the capture of Maduro was a law-enforcement operation against an illegitimate leader responsible for both drug trafficking and terrorism. "You can't turn Venezuela into the operating hub for Iran, for Hezbollah, for gangs, for the Cuban intelligence agents and other malign actors that control that country," Waltz told the Council. "You cannot continue to have the largest energy reserves in the world under the control of adversaries of the US." For many European countries, the seizing of Maduro has posed a difficult diplomatic dilemma. Some have been torn between defending fundamental principles of the UN charter that countries should not breach each other's sovereignty, or making a pragmatic, real politik decision not to anger the US on whose support and security they rely, especially for Ukraine Hence UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's refusal to say if the US attack on Venezuela was a breach of international law. He said merely that "international law is the framework, is the anchor or the benchmark against which we judge the actions of all other governments. And it is, of course, for the US to justify the action that it has taken". Likewise, the EU issued its own statement, saying that "under all circumstances, the principles of international law and the UN Charter must be upheld" without saying whether that applied in this case. The EU considered Maduro illegitimate and his drug trafficking a "significant security threat worldwide" but the bloc said nothing about Trump's declaration that the US will now "run" the country. The French and Danish criticism now places them alongside Spain, which had been the only European country to voice concerns, with Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez saying his government would "not recognise an intervention that violates international law and pushes the region toward a horizon of uncertainty and belligerence". The difficulty for other European leaders, fearful of upsetting Trump, is that they risk accusations of hypocrisy from other countries. For years, European powers have argued Russia's invasion of Ukraine should be opposed in part because it broke international rules about territorial integrity. Many developing countries rejected that argument, citing western military adventurism from Vietnam to Iraq. They will now add Venezuela to that list. The question is how Europe may respond in the longer term to America's military operation in Venezuela. Will it provide a catalyst for the continent to take greater responsibility for its own security in the face of so much instability from what many see as an unreliable ally? Donald Tusk, the prime minister of Poland, certainly hopes so, saying on social media: "No-one will take seriously a weak and divided Europe: neither enemy nor ally. It is already clear now. "We must finally believe in our own strength, we must continue to arm ourselves, we must stay united like never before. One for all, and all for one. Otherwise, we are finished."

**Excerpt**

Trump's seizure of Maduro raises thorny legal questions, in US and abroad On Monday morning, a handcuffed, jumpsuit-clad Nicholas Maduro stepped off a military helicopter in New York City, flanked by armed federal agents. The Venezuelan president had spent the night in a notorious federal jail in Brooklyn, before authorities transported him to a Manhattan courthouse to face criminal charges. Attorney General Pam Bondi has said Maduro was brought to the US to "face justice". But international law experts question the legality of the Trump administration's actions, and argue the US may have violated international statutes governing the use of force. Domestically, however, the US's actions fall into a legal grey area that may still result in Maduro standing trial, regardless of the circumstances that brought him there. The US maintains its actions were legally justified. The Trump administration has accused Maduro of "narco-terrorism" and enabling the transport of "thousands of tonnes" of cocaine to the US. "All personnel involved acted professionally, decisively, and in strict accordance with US law and established protocols," Bondi said in a statement. Maduro has long denied US allegations that he oversees an illegal drug operation, and in court in New York on Monday he entered a plea of not guilty. Although the charges are focused on drugs, the US prosecution of Maduro comes after years of criticism of his leadership of Venezuela from the wider international community. In 2020, UN investigators said Maduro's government had committed "egregious violations" amounting to crimes against humanity - and that the president and other top officials were implicated. The US and some of its allies have also accused Maduro of rigging elections, and did not recognise him as the legitimate president. Maduro's alleged links to drugs cartels are the focus of this legal case, yet the US methods in putting him before a US judge to answer these charges are also under scrutiny. Conducting a military operation in Venezuela and whisking Maduro out of the country under the cover of darkness was "completely illegal under international law," said Luke Moffett, a professor at the Queen's University Belfast School of Law. Professor Moffett and other experts pointed to a host of issues raised by the US operation. The United Nations Charter prohibits members from threatening or using force against other states. It allows for "self-defence if an armed attack occurs" but that threat must be imminent, Prof Moffett said. The other exception occurs when the UN Security Council approves such an action, which the US did not obtain before it took action in Venezuela. International law would consider the drug-trafficking offences the US alleges against Maduro to be a law enforcement matter, experts say, not a violent attack that might justify one country to take military action against another. In public statements, the Trump administration has characterised the operation as, in the words of Secretary of State Marco Rubio, "basically a law enforcement function", rather than an act of war or a military campaign. Maduro has been under indictment on drug trafficking charges in the US since 2020; the justice department has now issued a superseding - or revised - indictment against the Venezuelan leader. The Trump administration essentially says it is now enforcing it. "The mission was conducted to support an ongoing criminal prosecution tied to large-scale narcotics trafficking and related offenses that have fuelled violence, destabilised the region, and contributed directly to the drug crisis claiming American lives," Bondi said in her statement. But since the operation, several legal experts have said the US broke international law by taking Maduro out of Venezuela on its own. "A country cannot go into another foreign country and arrest people," said Milena Sterio, an expert on international criminal law at Cleveland State University College of Law. "If the US wants to arrest someone in another country, the proper way to do that is extradition." Even if an individual faces indictment in America, "The US has no right to go around the wold enforcing the arrest warrant in the territory of other sovereign states," she said. Maduro's lawyers in court in Manhattan on Monday said they would challenge the legality of the US operation which took him from Caracas to New York. There's also a long-running legal debate about whether presidents must follow the UN Charter. The US Constitution considers treaties the country enters to be the "supreme law of the land". But there's a clear historic example of a presidential administration arguing it did not have to comply with the charter. In 1989, the George HW Bush administration removed Panama's military leader Manuel Noriega and brought him to the US to face drug trafficking charges. An internal Justice Department memo from the time argued that the president had the legal authority to order the FBI to arrest individuals who violated US law, "even if those actions contravene customary international law" - including the UN Charter. The author of that memo, William Barr, became the US attorney general during Trump's first term, and brought the initial 2020 indictment against Maduro. However, the memo's reasoning later came under criticism from legal scholars. US courts have not explicitly weighed in on the matter. In the US, the question of whether this operation broke any domestic laws is complicated. The US Constitution gives Congress the power to declare war, but puts the president in charge of the armed forces. A Nixon-era law called the War Powers Resolution places restrictions on the president's ability to use military force. It requires the president to consult Congress before committing US troops abroad "in every possible instance," and notify Congress within 48 hours of deploying forces. The Trump administration did not give Congress a heads up before the action in Venezuela "because it endangers the mission," Rubio said on Saturday. However, several presidents have tested the limits of their powers to order military actions without congressional approval, and Trump has been carrying out military strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean for months despite bipartisan criticism. US federals courts now have jurisdiction over Maduro, regardless of how he arrived. Maduro could argue that the US violated international laws when it forcibly brought him to New York. But extensive legal precedent suggests a trial against Maduro would go forward, Prof Sterio said. "Our courts have long recognised that for a defendant, even if they are kidnapped or abducted or forcibly brought to the US, that is not grounds for tossing out the case," she said.
