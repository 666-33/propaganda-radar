Thirty-two Cubans killed during US attack on Venezuela The Cuban government has said 32 of its nationals were killed during the US operation to capture Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro. It said the dead were members of its armed forces and intelligence agencies, with two days of national mourning declared. A short statement did not elaborate on the role of the Cubans in Venezuela, but the two governments are long-standing allies, with Cuba providing security support in exchange for oil. Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel said they had been providing protection to Maduro and his wife "at the request" of Venezuela. An official government statement read: "Our compatriots fulfilled their duty with dignity and heroism and fell, after fierce resistance, in direct combat against the attackers or as a result of bombings on the facilities." Venezuela has not confirmed how many people were killed during the US raid on Maduro's compound in Caracas on Saturday. The New York Times, citing an unnamed Venezuelan official, reported on Sunday that the death toll stood at 80 and was expected to rise. BBC News has not independently verified that report. In the days following the capture of Maduro, questions have been raised over whether the Trump administration could consider a similar operation against Cuba, which, like Venezuela, has had decades of adversarial relations with the US. Speaking to reporters on Sunday, US President Donald Trump said military action would not be necessary because "Cuba is ready to fall". He continued: "I don't think we need any action. Looks like it's going down. It's going down for the count." On Saturday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio described Cuba as a "disaster" run by "incompetent, senile men". "If I lived in Havana, and I was in the government, I'd be concerned - at least a little bit," Rubio said. In July last year, Trump signed a memorandum imposing tighter restrictions on Cuba, reversing moves by his predecessor Joe Biden easing pressure on the Caribbean island nation. The White House said it would end "economic practices that disproportionately benefit the Cuban government, military, intelligence, or security agencies at the expense of the Cuban people". It also said existing restrictions on Americans visiting Cuba would be more stringently enforced. During his first term as president, Trump took a similar approach to Cuba, implementing a raft of additional sanctions. His administration has continued an economic embargo on Cuba, despite calls by international organisations including the United Nations to end it. The blockade was initially imposed in 1962 and has been in place ever since.

**Excerpt**

Activist group says it was behind Berlin fire that cut power to thousands A far-left activist group in Germany has claimed responsibility for a suspected arson attack that left tens of thousands of homes, as well as hospitals and businesses, without power in around-freezing temperatures. The Vulkangruppe (Volcano Group) said in a statement that the fossil fuel economy, not cutting power, was the target of the action. It will take until Thursday to reconnect power for all customers, with some schools due to be closed at the start of this week. Early on Saturday, several cables on a bridge were spotted burning near a power plant in south-west Berlin. The fire was quickly put out, but around 45,000 households and 2,200 businesses were left without electricity. The state economy minister told German media that incendiary devices had caused the damage. Berlin's mayor condemned the attack, accusing "suspected left-wing extremists" of knowingly endangering lives, especially those of patients in hospitals. Hospitals and care facilities had received emergency power generators, officials said. The response had included transferring individuals from care sites and people requiring care in their own homes from the affected area to care facilities with reported available capacity. Some hospitals had their electricity restored by Sunday. As of Sunday afternoon, around 10,000 households and 300 businesses had been reconnected, with most still waiting to receive power back. Some schools, which were due to reopen on Monday after the Christmas holidays, will remain closed. The capital's electricity operator said it would take until Thursday to reconnect all customers. The Vulkangruppe in its statement apologised to less affluent residents impacted by the power cuts, but said it had less sympathy for "the many owners of villas". The statement said the attack on the gas-fired power plant was an "act of self-defence" and solidarity with those who protect the earth. Police told AFP news agency they believed the statement was "plausible" while they continued to investigate, with other media reporting police thought it was credible. The Vulkangruppe previously claimed responsibility for a suspected arson attack that halted production at Tesla's Berlin car factory in 2024.
