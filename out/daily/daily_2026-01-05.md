Trump warns new Venezuelan leader as Maduro set to appear in court Donald Trump has warned Venezuela's new leader Delcy Rodríguez she could "pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro" if she "doesn't do what's right". His comments to US magazine The Atlantic came as the country's deposed president Nicolás Maduro was set to appear in a New York court on Monday. The US accuses Maduro, who is charged with drug trafficking and weapons offences, of running a "narco-terrorist" regime, a claim he denies. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has insisted the US is not at war with Venezuela, after air strikes in Caracas on Saturday led to Maduro and his wife being taken into custody and transported to the US. Some Democratic lawmakers said the operation was an "act of war". In an interview with The Atlantic on Sunday, Trump said of Rodríguez: "If she doesn't do what's right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro." He added that for Venezuela,"Regime change, anything you want to call it, is better than what you have right now. Can't get any worse". On Saturday, Trump had vowed the US would "run" the country until "a safe and proper and judicious transition" was possible. Trump also promised US oil companies would move into the country to fix infrastructure "and start making money for the country". Despite the US president's claims, Maduro's allies remain in charge. The Cuban government has said 32 "brave Cuban combatants" died when US forces attacked and captured Maduro and his wife. Cuba - a longstanding socialist ally of Maduro - has announced two days of national mourning. In several TV interviews on Sunday morning, Rubio defended the US's military operation in Venezuela, stressing the action did not mean the US is at war with the South American country. "We are at war against drug trafficking organisations. That's not a war against Venezuela," Rubio told NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday morning. The secretary of state also told CBS that if Venezuela doesn't "make the right decisions", the US "will retain multiple levers of leverage to ensure that our interests are protected". That includes the "quarantine" the US has placed on Venezuela's oil, he said. "We're going to judge everything by what they do, and we're going to see what they do," he added. Trump also threatened Venezuela's neighbour Colombia, in comments to reporters aboard Air Force One. He did not rule out military action against Colombia, saying "it sounds good to me", and called Colombian President Gustavo Petro "a sick man". "Colombia is very sick, too, run by a sick man, who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States, and he's not going to be doing it very long," Trump said. Maduro, who leads the United Socialist Party of Venezuela and has been in power since 2013, has frequently been accused of repressing opposition groups and silencing dissent in Venezuela, at times with the use of violence. He is widely seen by opponents within his country as well as by foreign governments as having illegitimately won Venezuela's 2024 election. Venezuela's left-wing leader and his wife, Cilia Flores, were captured at their compound and flown to the US, as part of a dramatic special forces operation in the early hours of Saturday that also saw strikes on military bases. The couple have since been charged with weapon and drug offences and are set to appear at a court in New York on Monday. Maduro has denied being a cartel leader and has accused the US of using its "war on drugs" as an excuse to try to depose him and get its hands on Venezuela's oil. While US officials have said that no American troops were harmed in the attacks, Venezuela's Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino said a "large part" of Maduro's security team and "soldiers and innocent civilians" were killed in the US operation. When asked why congressional authorisation wasn't sought before the US operation in Venezuela, Rubio told ABC it "wasn't necessary because this wasn't an invasion". He described it as a "law enforcement operation", and said Maduro was arrested on the ground by FBI agents. You can't notify Congress of an operation like this because "it will leak", he added. Maduro's vice president Delcy Rodríguez is now the interim president after being sworn in by the nation's Supreme Court. The country's military has also given its backing to her. She will be sworn in as president on Monday in Caracas, at 08:00 local time (12:00 GMT). Speaking to US media outlets, Rubio was asked if the US recognises Rodríguez as the legitimate president of Venezuela. He answered that "this is not about the legitimate president" as the US does not recognise the regime as legitimate. Some Democratic lawmakers have condemned the administration's actions. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said the secretive military operation, which was conducted without approval from Congress, "was not simply a narcotics operation". "It was an act of war," Jeffries told NBC's Meet the Press. "This was a military action involving Delta Force, involving the army, apparently involving thousands of troops, involving at least 150 military aircraft, perhaps involving dozens of ships off the coast of Venezuela and South America." Jim Himes, the most senior Democrat on the House intelligence committee, told CBS Face the Nation he had had "zero outreach" from the Trump administration, adding "no Democrat that I'm aware of has had any outreach". In an interview with ABC This Week, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer questioned the legality of the US operation. Schumer said that while he believes Maduro is a horrible person, "You don't treat lawlessness with other lawlessness". "We have learned through the years when America tries to do regime change and nation building in this way, the American people pay the price in both blood and in dollars," Schumer said. He added that Trump had abandoned his campaign promise of "no more endless wars". Both Schumer and Jeffries vowed to support a resolution that, if passed in both houses, would prohibit Trump from taking any further action in Venezuela without Congressional approval. In a joint statement, the governments of Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Uruguay and Spain said the US's military actions "constitute an extremely dangerous precedent for peace and regional security and endanger the civilian population". They said they wanted a solution to the Venezuela situation to come from peaceful means such as dialogue and negotiation. They also expressed concern about external control that is "incompatible with international law" and "threatens the political, economic, and social stability of the region".

**Excerpt**

South Korea's Lee Jae Myung to meet China's Xi in reset of relations South Korea's President Lee Jae Myung is set to meet Chinese leader Xi Jinping as he seeks to reset frayed ties with his country's biggest trading partner. Regional security and Beijing's unofficial ban on Korean pop culture are also on the agenda for Monday's meeting, which is their second summit since November, when Xi visited South Korea. Given what a vital economic partner China is, experts say Lee is looking for assurances that it would not weaponise that relationship in the face of political tensions in the region. For weeks, China and Japan have been engaged in a diplomatic row over the former's claim on self-governed Taiwan, which puts Seoul, a key regional power, in an awkward spot. Beijing ramped up the rhetoric against Japan after its prime minister Sanae Takaichi suggested in parliament that Tokyo could respond with its own self defence force in case of a Chinese attack on Taiwan. So visiting Beijing at this time is a significant move for Lee. Like Japan, South Korea too is an ally of the US, which supports Taiwan and supplies arms for its defence. Lee, who arrived in Beijing on Sunday, will attend a banquet hosted by Xi on Monday. He will then meet China's Premier Li Qiang and the chairman of parliament, Zhao Leji, before flying to Shanghai. Speaking before Korean residents in Beijing, Lee said his visit would "serve as a new starting point to fill in the gaps in Korea-China relations, restore them to normal and upgrade them to a new level". This is the first visit by a South Korean leader since 2019. The relationship soured under Lee's predecessor, impeached ex-president Yoon Suk Yeol, who was very critical of China. On the other side, Xi's eagerness to meet Lee signals the pressure he faces in finding a regional ally, Park Seung-chan, professor of China studies at Yongin University told the BBC. "China may beat around the bush but its demand is clear: side with China and denounce Japan." Beijing has been leveraging the two countries' shared history of fighting against Japan during the 20th Century, Mr Park said. Lee is expected to hold a memorial service in Shanghai for activists who fought for Korea's independence from Japan. While Korea is "still showing all its deference towards China", it wants to "strengthen its relationships with both Japan and China", Mr Park added. Seoul has long walked a diplomatic tightrope between Beijing and Tokyo. Lee is reportedly planning to visit Japan later this month to meet Takaichi. And on Friday, South Korea's national security director Wi Sung-lac told reporters the country "respects the One China policy" - the diplomatic acknowledgment that Beijing is the only Chinese government. Security on the Korean Peninsula will also be part of the discussions with China, Wi told reporters. Lee has sought to engage North Korea diplomatically, but there has been little progress so far. He needs Chinese cooperation in pressuring the North's Kim Jong Un to give up his nuclear weapons. Beijing is the dictator's biggest supporter, economically and diplomatically, Russia aside. "China is a very important cooperative partner in moving toward peace and unification on the Korean Peninsula," Lee said on Sunday. Earlier in the day Seoul's military said Pyongyang fired ballistic missiles off its east coast. And on Monday the North's state news agency said the country test-fired hypersonic missiles to assess deterrence capabilities following recent developments, a reference to the US's capture of Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro over the weekend. It remains unclear how much Lee will be able to push China on North Korea. In September, Xi had pledged to strengthen Beijing's "traditional friendship" with Pyongyang. And Seoul and Beijing are not natural allies. US troops have been stationed in South Korea for decades in case of an attack from the North, and last year the two sides agreed to cooperate on building nuclear-powered submarines. The announcement drew warnings from China. There are other sore spots, such as China's unofficial restrictions on South Korean music and dramas that have been in place for a decade. K-pop and K-dramas are either unavailable or difficult to access on Chinese media platforms. While China has never acknowledged a ban on Korean artists, it's believed to be a protest against South Korea's decision to deploy a US anti-missile system in 2016, which China sees as a threat to its military operations in the region. Persuading Beijing to lift these restrictions is said to be high on Lee's agenda. China is a massive market for Korean entertainment, which is already a huge global success. Lee would also be seeking to put a stop to China's build-up of maritime structures in waters between the two countries. Beijing says the structures are fish-farming equipment, but they have sparked security concerns in Seoul.

**Excerpt**

Activist group says it was behind Berlin fire that cut power to thousands A far-left activist group in Germany has claimed responsibility for a suspected arson attack that left tens of thousands of homes, as well as hospitals and businesses, without power in around-freezing temperatures. The Vulkangruppe (Volcano Group) said in a statement that the fossil fuel economy, not cutting power, was the target of the action. It will take until Thursday to reconnect power for all customers, with some schools due to be closed at the start of this week. Early on Saturday, several cables on a bridge were spotted burning near a power plant in south-west Berlin. The fire was quickly put out, but around 45,000 households and 2,200 businesses were left without electricity. The state economy minister told German media that incendiary devices had caused the damage. Berlin's mayor condemned the attack, accusing "suspected left-wing extremists" of knowingly endangering lives, especially those of patients in hospitals. Hospitals and care facilities had received emergency power generators, officials said. The response had included transferring individuals from care sites and people requiring care in their own homes from the affected area to care facilities with reported available capacity. Some hospitals had their electricity restored by Sunday. As of Sunday afternoon, around 10,000 households and 300 businesses had been reconnected, with most still waiting to receive power back. Some schools, which were due to reopen on Monday after the Christmas holidays, will remain closed. The capital's electricity operator said it would take until Thursday to reconnect all customers. The Vulkangruppe in its statement apologised to less affluent residents impacted by the power cuts, but said it had less sympathy for "the many owners of villas". The statement said the attack on the gas-fired power plant was an "act of self-defence" and solidarity with those who protect the earth. Police told AFP news agency they believed the statement was "plausible" while they continued to investigate, with other media reporting police thought it was credible. The Vulkangruppe previously claimed responsibility for a suspected arson attack that halted production at Tesla's Berlin car factory in 2024.

At least 30 killed in attack on Nigeria village Armed men have violently stormed a village in Nigeria's Niger state, killing at least 30 people and looting shops, state authorities have said. The attackers emerged from a forest near the village of Kasuwan-Daji on Saturday and set fire to the local market, looted shops and kidnapped an unspecified number of people, police said. "The gunmen entered the town on motorcycles carrying weapons, rounded up people and then proceeded to slaughter them, while others were shot dead," a local journalist told the BBC's Hausa service. Attacks and kidnappings by armed criminal gangs, known as bandits, have been a problem in Nigeria for years, but reports in western and central regions have spiked recently. Abdullahi Rofia, an official with the Niger State Emergency Management Agency, confirmed the journalist's report that villagers were rounded up and killed. He told the BBC that people in the community were terrified: "They are hiding, they are too afraid to talk to anybody. "They are scared that if you talk, they will turn and do the same to you." Niger state police spokesperson, Wasiu Abiodun, said an emergency team has been deployed to help the injured and security forces are working to rescue those kidnapped. It is illegal to pay ransom money to the criminal groups, which the government has classified as terrorists, but there are claims this is often ignored. A witness to the attack told BBC Hausa that there were no security forces in the village. "We want the government to help us. In the past, we used to hear about this problem in other places, but now it is happening in our villages," he said. The fear is driving people from their homes where they were born and raised. "We are dying like chickens, and does the government care about us? "The government hears and sees what is happening, but it is not doing anything about it. What can we do as ordinary people?" The attack happened just a day after authorities in Niger state announced the phased reopening of schools, after a mass kidnapping forced them to close as part of emergency security measures. In November, more than 250 students and staff from St Mary's Catholic school in Papiri, Niger state, were abducted. It was one of the country's worst kidnappings to date, however just before Christmas, officials confirmed that all of the missing students and teachers had been rescued.

Thousands stranded across Europe as Greece airspace disrupted Thousands of passengers are stranded across Europe after a communications failure forced Greece to close its airspace, causing widespread cancellations and delays. Officials are working to understand why radio communications were disrupted on Sunday morning, prompting the temporary suspension of arrivals and departures. Some departures have since been allowed to resume - though inbound flights are still being told to divert or return to their point of origin. Athens' main airport is among the worst affected, while Thessaloniki airport has closed entirely. The timing of the disruption has raised fears that travellers will not be able to get home before the start of the working week. "I was supposed to fly to London, via Stockholm, with SAS," one passenger at Athens International Airport told Greek broadcaster Mega TV. "I'm working on Newport Hospital tomorrow morning. I'm not going to be there on time, I don't know what else to say. "Who is going to pay for the additional cost this travel will cost me? We still don't know if and when we're going to leave, no one is telling us anything." More than 90 flights have been affected in and out of Athens airport alone - though some flights have since been able to resume. A member of staff in the airport told the BBC that 35 aircraft an hour were now being allowed to take off, but it was still unable to take inbound flights. Flights departing from Dublin, Barcelona and Paris were earlier ordered to return to their airports of origin, while services from Copenhagen and Malta were cancelled altogether. Other arrivals into Athens were placed on standby, while flights in and out of other Greek airports have also been affected. Three flights out of Heraklion airport on the island of Crete, including one to Munich, have been delayed, according to public broadcaster ERT. Most inbound flights are being diverted to Turkey if not cancelled outright, it reports. The disruption comes at a busy time for air travel in and out of Athens, which typically sees more than 600 scheduled flights per day, as people return from winter holidays. In the chaos, some passengers have complained of a lack of information. One told news site Flash: "We have no updates. They told us that we will be able to leave but I don't think this is true. On the departures board I can't see my flight, and I'm supposed to leave shortly." Another, who had been on a flight to Rhodes when it turned around and headed back to Athens, told news agency Reuters: "From that moment until now we have no information whatsoever." Domestic travellers may have the option of getting home on Greece's rail network, but this would take significantly longer. The issue that caused the disruption is thought to concern the radio system used by air traffic controllers to communicate with planes in their airspace. Panagiotis Psarros, chair of the Association of Greek Air Traffic Controllers, told ERT that all frequencies were "suddenly lost", adding: "We could not communicate with aircraft in the sky." The broadcaster later reported than an initial investigation by the Greek security services suggested the problem may be due to the failure of an antenna in the Gerania Mountains near Athens. Italy, Turkey and Cyprus are assisting Greece in managing the situation.

**Excerpt**

The French university where spies go for training University professor Xavier Crettiez admits that he doesn't know the real names of many of the students on his course. This is a highly unusual state of affairs in the world of academia, but Prof Crettiez's work is far from standard. Instead, he helps train France's spies. "I rarely know the intelligence agents' backgrounds when they are sent on the course, and I doubt the names I'm given are genuine anyway," he says. If you wanted to create a setting for a spy school, then the campus of Sciences Po Saint-Germain on the outskirts of Paris seems a good fit. With dour, even gloomy-looking, early 20th Century buildings surrounded by busy, drab roads and large, intimidating metal gates, it has a very discreet feel. Where it does stand out is its unique diploma that brings together more typical students in their early 20s, and active members of the French secret services, usually between the ages of 35 and 50. The course is called Diplôme sur le Renseignement et les Menaces Globales, which translates as Diploma of Intelligence and Global Threats. It was developed by the university in association with the Academie du Renseignement, the training arm of the French secret services. This came following a request from French authorities a decade ago. After the 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris, the government went on a large recruitment drive within the French intelligence agencies. It asked Sciences Po, one of France's leading universities, to come up with a new course to both train potential new spies, and provide continuous training for current agents. Large French companies were also quick to show an interest, both in getting their security staff onto the course, and snapping up many of the younger graduates. The diploma is made up of 120 hours of classwork with modules spread over four months. For external students – the spies and those on placement from businesses – it costs around €5,000 ($5,900; £4,400). The core aim of the course is to identify threats wherever they are, and how to track and overcome them. The key topics include the economics of organized crime, Islamic jihadism, business intelligence gathering and political violence. To attend one of the classes and speak to the students I had to be vetted first by the French security services. The theme of the lesson I joined was "intelligence and over-reliance on technology". One of the students I speak to is a man in his 40s who goes by the name Roger. He tells me in very precise, clipped English that he is investment banker. He adds: "I provide consultancy across west Africa, and I joined the course to provide risk assessments to my clients there." Prof Crettiez, who teaches political radicalisation, says there has been a huge expansion in the French secret services in recent years. And that there are now around 20,000 agents in what he called the "inner circle". This is made up of the DGSE, which looks at matters overseas, and is the French equivalent of the UK's MI6 or the US's CIA. And the DGSI, which focuses on threats within France, like the UK's MI5 or the US's FBI. But he says it's not just about terrorism. "There are the two main security agencies, but also Tracfin an intelligence agency which specializes in money laundering. "It is preoccupied with the surge in mafia activity, especially in southern France, including corruption in the public and private sectors mainly due to massive profits in illegal drug trafficking." Other lecturers on the course include a DGSE official once located in Moscow, a former French ambassador to Libya, and a senior official from Tracfin. The head of security at the French energy giant EDF also runs one module. The private sector's interest in the diploma is said to be continuing to grow. Big businesses, especially in the defence and aerospace sector, but also French luxury goods firms, are increasingly keen to hire the students as they face relentless cybersecurity and spying threats as well as sabotage. Recently graduates have been snapped up by the French mobile phone operator Orange, aerospace and defence giant Thales, and LVHM, which owns everything from Louis Vuitton and Dior to champagne brands Dom Perignon and Krug. Twenty eight students are enrolled in this year's class. Six are spies. You can tell who they are, as they are the ones huddled together during class breaks, away from the young students, and not too overwhelmed with joy when I approach them. Without saying their exact roles, and with arms crossed, one says the course is considered a fast-track stepping stone for a promotion from the office to field work. Another says he gets fresh ideas being in this academic environment. They signed the day's attendance form with just their first names. One of the younger students, Alexandre Hubert, 21, says he wanted a deeper understanding of the looming economic war between Europe and China. "Looking at intelligence gathering from a James Bond viewpoint is not relevant, the job is analysing risk and working out how to counteract it," he tells me. Another class member, Valentine Guillot, also 21, says she was inspired by the popular, fictional French TV spy drama Le Bureau. "Coming here to discover this world which I didn't know anything about except for the TV series has been a remarkable opportunity, and now I am very keen to join the security services." Nearly half of the students in the class are in fact women. And this is a relatively recent development according to one of the lecturers, Sebastien-Yves Laurent, a specialist on technology in spying. "Women's interest in intelligence gathering is new," he says. "They are interested because they think it will provide for a better world. "And if there is one common thread amongst all these young students it's that they are very patriotic and that is new compared to 20 years ago. If you are keen to apply to get on the course, French citizenship is an essential requirement, although some dual citizens are accepted. Yet Prof Crettiez says he has to be wary. "I regularly get applications from very attractive Israeli and Russian women with amazing CVs. Unsurprisingly they are binned immediately." In a recent group photo of the class you can immediately tell who the spies are - they had their backs to the camera. While all the students and professional spies I met are trim and athletic, Prof Crettiez is also keen to dispel the myth of James Bond-like adventure. "Few new recruits will end up in the field," he says. "Most French intelligence agencies jobs are desk bound."

**Excerpt**

South Korea's 'movie of the year' is an indie story about a teen's trauma Yoon Ga-eun was not a name many would have recognised in South Korea. That is until her movie about a teenager who is a survivor of sexual violence became a dark-horse hit. "It hasn't really sunk in yet," indie filmmaker Ms Yoon told BBC Korean at a studio in Seoul in late November. "Now I just feel almost blank - just grateful, and also a bit scared." The World of Love has been dubbed the "movie of the year" by Korean media for its touching, empathetic portrayal of life after trauma. Instead of recreating the crime, the movie tells the story of what comes after: the everyday life of high-schooler Joo-in, from school to romance to family and friendships, and all the moments of conflict and joy that go along with it. It has earned the praise of critics and audiences, and more than $1.1m in box office revenue since its debut in October. Viewers have given it a 9 out of 10 on South Korea's largest search portal, Naver. "Simply a masterpiece," is how Bong Jun-ho, director of the globally acclaimed film Parasite and the first Korean to win an Oscar, described it. He called himself the "head of the Seoul branch of Yoon Ga-eun's fan club". The film has resonated in a deeply patriarchal country, where women say they fight hard just to be heard. And its surprising success is a sign of the growing willingness to engage in conversations about sexual violence and how survivors are treated. 'That's not all I am' The World of Love may not seem like an obvious choice for movie-goers. The Korean title, "Joo-in of the World", says little about the plot. While it stars Parasite actor Jang Hye-jin and K-drama star Go Min-si, the lead is played by Seo Su-bin, a new face on the big screen. At its heart, this is a story about the the life of 17-year-old Joo-in. Everything is going well for her. She is popular at school, has a devoted boyfriend, and lives with a caring mum and adorable younger brother. Tension begins over her refusal to sign a petition at school. A man who assaulted a 10-year-old child is about to be released from jail into her neighbourhood. So a fellow student starts a petition calling for the suspension of his release. Joo-in is the only one who refuses to sign. She objects to a single line in the petition: "Sexual violence leaves deep wounds that never heal and completely destroys a person's life and soul." "I can't agree with this statement," Joo-in tells the student who drafted it. The standoff ends up revealing her secret: she was raped by a relative when she was younger. Despite the harrowing theme, Ms Yoon is determined to explore the fullness of Joo-in's life, whose name means "owner" or "master" in Korean, alluding to the autonomy Ms Yoon envisioned for her character. Journalists who attended the media screening received a hand-written letter from Ms Yoon asking them to avoid mentioning sexual violence while covering the film. "The story is more about how we look at her," Ms Yoon explained to the BBC, adding that she didn't want to pin a label - childhood sexual abuse survivor - on her protagonist. "Because Joo-in herself refuses that. It's one part of her identity and it shakes her, but she insists, 'That's not all I am'." When she decided to make a film about sexual violence, Ms Yoon was clear about one thing. She did not want it to be predictable. During her research, she said she "watched pretty much everything that was out there" on this subject. She spoke with survivors and consulted activists. Those conversations shattered the "prejudice" she carried, an ignorance that "reduces a person entirely to their wound". "We spent so much time talking about completely ordinary concerns," she said. "Worries about work, family, friendships and romances, about needing to lose weight or gain weight or exercise more. I think those moments dissolved even that last tiny bit of prejudice I still had." This touched audiences. Those who liked the film say it challenges the stereotypes we project onto survivors of sexual crimes, encouraging audiences to see them differently - people who are part of society and trying to live their lives like everyone else. When Seo Jinwon, a children's book editor watched the film in Seoul, she said, the cinema "fell completely silent" as the film ended. "No-one rushed to leave. I stayed and watched the end credits. I walked out of the cinema thinking, 'I want to be a good adult who can stand beside all the children and teenagers who are trying so hard to grow up'." A sexual violence survivor who wished to remain anonoymous said she had an urge to "stretch my arms and cheer" when she walked out of the cinema. "Joo-in gave me so much. At the end, it felt like she was smiling at me and saying, 'I am living well, so let's keep living well together'." The right moment The World of Love is doing what activists have long worked towards, according to Cho Eunhee, director of Korea Sexual Violence Relief Center who worked as a consultant on the film. The timing, she added, "is incredibly right". After the 2017–2018 MeToo movement, it became easier for survivors to share their stories, and the country grew more protective and understanding towards them. By 2025, when Ms Yoon's film was released, "people were more prepared to empathise with a story like this," Ms Cho said. She wonders if, even a few years earlier, the film would have "found this level of public understanding". While the MeToo movement sparked conversations about harassment and assaults in workplaces and outside the home, exposing abuse within families, she said, is still widely seen as "spitting in one's own face" - but this movie has made more room to talk about it. The World of Love is not without its critics. Some viewers, including survivors, said it felt unrepresentative of their reality because it downplayed the fear and lasting damage of abuse, portraying families as more supportive than they often were. But criticism does not overshadow the film's value, critic Min Youngjun said, adding that The World of Love has created a healthy space for talking about sexual violence and its victims. "The mark of a good film is not how many people liked it versus didn't like it. What matters is whether it creates a space in which we can talk to each other about what it has put on the table."
