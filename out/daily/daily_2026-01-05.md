Ten found guilty of cyber-bullying Brigitte Macron Ten people have been found guilty of cyber-bullying Brigitte Macron, the wife of French President Emmanuel Macron, by a Paris court. The defendants were accused of spreading false claims about her gender and sexuality, as well as making "malicious remarks" about the 24-year age gap between the couple. Most of the defendants were handed suspended prison sentences of up to eight months, but one was jailed immediately for failing to attend court. Some had their social media accounts suspended. The judge said the eight men and two women had acted with a clear desire to do harm to Brigitte Macron, making remarks online that were degrading and insulting. Two of the defendants - self-styled independent journalist Natacha Rey and internet fortune-teller Amandine Roy – were found guilty of slander in 2024 for claiming that France's first lady had never existed. They said her brother Jean-Michel Trogneux had changed gender and started using her name. They were later cleared on appeal. The argument used by the appeals court in clearing them was that saying someone had changed gender was not necessarily an "attack on their honour". The Macrons are now taking that case to the high court of appeal. "The most important things are the prevention courses and the suspension of some of the accounts" of the perpetrators, Jean Ennochi, Brigitte Macron's lawyer, said after the verdict was handed down, the AFP news agency reported. Tiphaine Auzière, Brigitte Macron's daughter from a previous marriage, previously told the trial that the cyber-bullying had negatively affected her mother's health and living conditions. She said her mother "has had to be careful about her choices of outfits, of posture... she knows perfectly well that her image will be used to back these theories". While her mother had "learned to live with it", Auzière said, she suffered from the repercussions on her grandchildren who were taunted at school. Monday's ruling in France is a forerunner of a much bigger trial due in the US, where the Macrons have filed a defamation lawsuit against right-wing influencer Candace Owens, who has also voiced conspiracy theories about the first lady's gender. They alleged that she "disregarded all credible evidence disproving her claim in favour of platforming known conspiracy theorists and proven defamers". Owens has regularly repeated the claims on her podcast and social media channels, and in March 2024 stated that she would stake her "entire professional reputation" on her belief that the first lady "is in fact a man". The presidential couple were initially advised that the best course was to ignore the online gossip, because to go to law would simply amplify it. But last year there was a radical change of course. The Macrons decided that the scale of the online attacks was now too large to ignore. So, at risk of exposing their private selves in a US court, they determined to push back against the conspiracy theorists. A conspiracy theory claiming that Brigitte Macron is a transgender woman has circulated since her husband was first elected in 2017. Brigitte Macron first met her now-husband when she was a teacher at his secondary school. The couple married in 2007, when the future French president was 29 and she was in her mid-50s.

Bluefin tuna fetches record $3.2m at Tokyo auction A bulky bluefin tuna made a splash at Tokyo's Toyosu fish market on Monday morning, fetching a record 510.3 million yen ($3.2m; £2.4m) at the market's first auction of the year. The winning bid for the 243kg fish came from Kiyomura Corp, the operator of popular sushi chain Sushi Zanmai, which has outlets across the country and abroad. "The year's first tuna brings good luck," said Kiyoshi Kimura, the company's president and a familiar figure at the annual new year's auction, Kyodo reported. Mr Kimura, who has been dubbed the Tuna King, is known to bid high for bluefin tuna at new year's auctions. The entrepreneur told reporters after the auction that he was "surprised at the price", AFP reported. "I'd thought we would be able to buy a little cheaper, but the price soared before you knew it," he said. In 2019 he bought a bluefin tuna with 333.6 million yen ($2.1m; £1.6m) - another historic price. Despite telling reporters at the time that he thought he "did too much", however, Mr Kimura has now gone on to break his own record again. The first auction at Tokyo's Toyosu fish market typically sees fish selling for exorbitant prices. Last year, the first tuna at the auction was bought for 207 million yen by Onodera Group, another food company that owns a sushi chain. It said that the fish would be served at its restaurants across the country. The frenetic energy at fish markets during such pre-dawn auctions has become a popular tourist attraction in Tokyo. Monday's auction, which started at around 05:00 local time (20:00 GMT), was no exception. The million-dollar tuna was sliced up for customers at Kimura's sushi restaurants shortly after it was auctioned off. "I feel like I've begun the year in a good way after eating something so auspicious as the year starts," one of the customers at Mr Kimura's restaurant told AFP.

Bowen: Trump's action could set precedent for authoritarian powers across globe With the seizure of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, Donald Trump has demonstrated more powerfully than ever his belief in the power of his will, backed by raw US military force. On his orders the US has Maduro behind bars and now will "run" Venezuela. The US president made the announcement in a remarkable news conference with enormous implications for US foreign policy worldwide at his Florida club and residence, Mar-a-Lago. Trump said the US would be in charge in Venezuela "until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition". US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, he said, had spoken to the Venezuelan Vice-President Delcy Rodríguez, who had told him "we'll do whatever you need... She, I think, was quite gracious, but she really doesn't have a choice". Trump was light on detail. He said that "we're not afraid of boots on the ground if we have to have [them]". But does he believe that he can govern Venezuela by remote control? Will this demonstration that he will back words with military action, praised lavishly at Mar-a-Lago by both Marco Rubio and the US Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth, be enough to reshape Venezuela and browbeat Latin American leaders into compliance? It sounded as if he believes something like that. The evidence is that it will not be easy or smooth. The respected think tank, the International Crisis Group, warned in October that the fall of Maduro could lead to violence and instability in Venezuela. The same month The New York Times reported that defence and diplomatic officials in the first Trump administration had war-gamed what might happen if Maduro fell. Their conclusion was the prospect of violent chaos as armed factions competed for power. The removal and incarceration of Nicolás Maduro is a remarkable assertion of American military power. The US assembled a massive armada and achieved its goal without losing a single American life. Maduro had ignored the will of the Venezuelan people by sweeping aside his own electoral defeat and, without question, his departure will be welcomed by many of its citizens. But the implications of the US action will reverberate forward, way beyond Venezuela's borders. The mood at the Mar-a-Lago news conference was triumphalist, as they celebrated what was undoubtedly a textbook operation carried out by highly professional US forces. The military operation is only the first stage. America's record of achieving regime change by force in the last 30 years is disastrous. The political follow-up is what makes or breaks the process. Iraq descended into a bloody catastrophe after the US invasion in 2003. In Afghanistan two decades and billions of dollars' worth of attempted nation-building were swept away in days after the US pulled out in 2021. Neither country was in America's backyard. Yet the ghosts of interventions past in Latin America - and the threat of others yet to come - are scarcely more promising. Trump tried out a new nickname, the Donroe Doctrine, for the declaration made by President James Monroe in 1823 warning other powers not to meddle in America's sphere of influence in the Western hemisphere. "The Monroe Doctrine is a big deal, but we've superseded it by a lot," Trump said at Mar-a-Lago. "Under our new national security strategy, American dominance in the Western hemisphere will never be questioned again." He said that the President of Colombia, Gustavo Petro, had to "watch his ass". Later he told Fox News that "something's going to have to be done with Mexico". Cuba is undoubtedly also on the US agenda, which is being driven by Rubio, whose parents are Cuban-Americans. The US has a long record of armed intervention in Latin America. I was in Haiti in 1994 when President Bill Clinton sent in 25,000 troops and two aircraft carriers to enforce regime change. Then, the Haitian regime crumbled without a shot being fired. Far from ushering in a better future, the 30 years since then have been a period of almost unbroken misery for the Haitian people. Haiti is now a failed state dominated by armed gangs. Donald Trump talked of making Venezuela great again, but not about democracy. He dismissed the idea that the Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado, who won the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize, should lead the country. "I think it'd be very tough for her to be the leader, she doesn't have the support... She doesn't have the respect." He did not mention Edmundo González, who many Venezuelans believe was the rightful winner of the 2024 elections. Instead, the US, for the time being anyway, is backing Maduro's Vice-President Delcy Rodríguez. While there must have been some kind of internal collusion that gave the US military the inside knowledge it needed to remove Maduro, the regime created by his predecessor, Hugo Chávez, appears to be intact. It is unlikely that the Venezuelan armed forces, despite any humiliation its generals might feel about their inability to oppose the US attack, will acquiesce with US plans. The military and the regime's civilian supporters have enriched themselves through networks of corruption that they will not want to lose. Civilian militias have been armed by the regime, and Venezuela has other armed groups. They include criminal networks, as well as Colombian guerrillas who backed the Maduro regime in return for sanctuary. The US intervention in Venezuela brings into stark focus some of the well springs of Trump's worldview. He makes no secret of the way he covets the mineral wealth of other countries. He has already attempted to extract profit from Ukraine's natural resources in return for military assistance. Trump does not hide his desire to control Venezuela's huge mineral reserves, and his belief that US oil companies were robbed when the oil industry was nationalised. "We're going to be taking out a tremendous amount of wealth out of the ground, and that wealth is going to the people of Venezuela, and people from outside of Venezuela that used to be in Venezuela, and it goes also to the United States of America in the form of reimbursement." That will deepen the fears in Greenland and Denmark that he will look north as well as south. The US has not dropped its desire to absorb Greenland, for its strategic position in the Arctic as well as the natural resources that are becoming more accessible as its ice melts due to global warming. The Maduro operation also amounts to another serious blow to the idea that the best way to run the world is to follow an agreed set of rules, as laid out in international law. The idea was tattered before Donald Trump took office, but he has already demonstrated repeatedly both in the US and internationally that he believes he can ignore laws he doesn't like. European allies, who are desperate not to anger him, including Prime Minister Keir Starmer, are wrestling with ways to say that they support the idea of international law without condemning the fact that the Maduro operation is a blatant violation of the Charter of the United Nations. The US justification that its military was simply aiding the execution of an arrest warrant for a drug lord masquerading as Venezuela's president is thin, especially given Trump's declarations that the US will now control the country and its oil industry. A few hours before Maduro and his wife were seized, he met Chinese diplomats at his palace in Caracas. China condemned the US action. It said "hegemonic acts of the US seriously violate international law and Venezuela's sovereignty and threaten peace and security in Latin America and the Caribbean region". The US should "stop violating other countries' sovereignty and security". Even so, China might see a precedent set by the US action. It regards Taiwan as a breakaway province and has declared that returning it to control of Beijing is a national priority. In Washington, that is certainly the fear of the Democratic vice-chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Senator Mark Warner. He issued a statement saying China's leaders, and others, will be watching closely. "If the United States asserts the right to use military force to invade and capture foreign leaders it accuses of criminal conduct, what prevents China from claiming the same authority over Taiwan's leadership? What stops [Russian President] Vladimir Putin from asserting similar justification to abduct Ukraine's president? Once this line is crossed, the rules that restrain global chaos begin to collapse, and authoritarian regimes will be the first to exploit it." Donald Trump seems to believe that he makes the rules, and what applies to the US under his command does not mean others can expect the same privileges. But that is not how the world of power works. His actions at the start of 2026 point to another 12 months of global turbulence.

### 4. [India wants more passenger jets. Can it also build them?](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpq4x0rw4vyo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

India wants more passenger jets. Can it also build them? India is one of the world's fastest-growing aviation markets. IndiGo and Air India, which together hold over 90% of the market, have ordered nearly 1,500 planes over the next decade, highlighting soaring passenger demand. This expansion hinges on Boeing and Airbus, which together supply 86% of the world's aircraft and faced "historically high" delivery backlogs in 2024 - delays expected to affect Indian orders too. This has revived an old question: should India try to build its own passenger planes? The prospect drew attention in October, when India and Russia signed an initial agreement in Moscow to manufacture the SJ-100 passenger plane in India, raising hopes for domestic aircraft production. But is the Russia deal a solution? Its joint manufacturing plan still faces many hurdles before coming to fruition. The SJ-100 is a twin-engine aircraft that can carry up to 103 passengers and is already in service with several Russian airlines, according to its manufacturer, United Aircraft Corporation (UAC). Delhi has described the aircraft as a "game changer" and plans to use it for short-haul routes. But experts have questioned the project's cost and feasibility - much of which is still unclear. One of the biggest concerns is whether the Russian firm would be able to rapidly set up and scale production in India. The aircraft's manufacturer says it delivered around 200 SJ-100 aircraft between 2008 and 2020. But that trajectory shifted in 2022 when Russia launched its war against Ukraine. Western sanctions cut off key spare parts, forcing the company to replace about 40 systems and operate an "import-substituted" version in 2023. Europe's aviation safety regulator withdrew the aircraft's certification, effectively banning the SJ-100 and other Russian planes from its airspace. India has long aimed to build passenger aircraft domestically but has achieved only limited success. In 1959, the government set up the National Aerospace Laboratories (NAL) to develop "small and medium-sized civil aircraft". The facility has developed the two-seater Hansa and five-seater trainer planes, but larger passenger aircraft remain out of reach. In the 1960s, India built passenger planes under foreign licenses. State-run Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) produced dozens of UK-designed Avro 748 jets, used by both commercial airlines and the military before being phased out. In the 1980s, India partnered with German firm Dornier to produce a 19-seat passenger jet, some of which still serve the military and limited civil routes. With the momentum going, India has also tried to ingeniously design its own small passenger planes. In 2000, India also signed an agreement with Russia for help in manufacturing the NAL's 15-seater Saras aircraft. The plane made its maiden flight in May 2004, but the project was stalled in 2009 after three pilots were killed during an accident involving its second prototype. The project was revived by the Indian government years later with the next prototype Saras MK2, a 19-seater plane, but it is still awaiting certification. Another such project, the Regional Transport Aircraft (RTA) has also seen very little progress through the years. Feasibility reports for the 90-seater, comparable to the Russian SJ-100, were submitted in 2011, with little progress since. Aviation experts say aircraft manufacturing in India has faced hurdles for a long time now. Dr Abhay Pashilkar, director of NAL, points that the "lack of large domestic demand" until recently, along with a shortage of highly skilled manpower and a small domestic manufacturing ecosystem, has held back growth in the sector. The way out, he adds, is "to engage with Indian as well as global manufacturers". So, could the SJ-100 project indeed be a game-changer? For now, it appears so. The plan offers a "practical approach" as India's own projects are nowhere near completion, says Gopal Sutar, former spokesperson of the HAL. For Moscow as well, wider acceptance of the SJ-100 would prove that they could make a civil aircraft without western technology. While the deal comes with clear trade-offs and leaves questions about the future of India's aviation manufacturing ambitions, experts like Mr Sutar argue that Russia's role as a "steadfast supporter" of India remains key. "Sanctions could pose challenges, but that would have been factored in by both countries," he said. Aircraft availability is only part of India's aviation challenge; rapid expansion also hinges on trained crews. Earlier this month, IndiGo cancelled thousands of flights due to "poor planning of pilot rosters," leaving tens of thousands of passengers stranded for hours or even days.
