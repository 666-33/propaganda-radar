World central bank chiefs 'stand in solidarity' with US Fed chair Powell Central banks across the world have joined together to declare that they stand in "full solidarity" with the Federal Reserve's chair after the US launched a criminal investigation into Jerome Powell. The heads of the Bank of England, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Canada are among 11 senior bankers who have signed a statement highlighting the importance of independence in setting interest rates. "Chair Powell has served with integrity, focused on his mandate and an unwavering commitment to the public interest," they said. The Department of Justice is conducting the probe. President Donald Trump has said he did not "know anything" about the investigation. The probe is linked to testimony Powell gave to a Senate committee about renovations to Federal Reserve buildings. It follows a year of relentless attacks on the Fed chair by Trump. As well as criticising Powell's decisions on interest rates, Trump has made personal comments, calling the Fed chair a "major loser" and a "numbskull". Commenting on the Fed chair, the global central bankers said in their joint statement: "To us, he is a respected colleague who is held in the highest regard by all who have worked with him." Until the weekend, Powell had stayed largely silent in the face of Trump's attacks but on Sunday, he publicly pushed back and warned that the independence of the US central bank was at stake. "This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions, or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation," Powell said. In their joint statement on Tuesday, the senior financial institutions said: "The independence of central banks is a cornerstone of price, financial and economic stability in the interest of the citizens that we serve. "It is therefore critical to preserve that independence, with full respect for the rule of law and democratic accountability." Powell, who Trump nominated as Fed chair in 2017 during his first term in the White House, is set to step down in May. Trump is expected to name his successor in the coming weeks. Several Republicans have spoken out against the justice department's move against the Fed. North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis, a Republican who is a member of the Senate Banking Committee, said he would oppose the nomination of Powell's replacement by Trump, and any other Fed Board nominee, until the matter was "fully resolved". The committee must approve the next Fed nominee so if Tillis keeps that pledge, it could delay the nomination of any Trump pick to replace Powell. His Republican colleague on the committee, Senator Kevin Cramer, said he thought Powell was a poor Fed chairman but did not believe he was a criminal. To restore confidence in the Fed, he added, the investigation should be swift. Another Republican senator, Lisa Murkowski, described the investigation as "an attempt at coercion". Powell has also been backed by three former chairs of the Fed - Janet Yellen, Ben Bernanke and Alan Greenspan. A number of other eminent former officials have publicly declared their support for him and the bank's independence. Yellen, who was Powell's immediate predecessor, said the criminal investigation was "extremely chilling", adding that investors should be concerned. "You have a president that says the Fed should be cutting rates to lower rate payments on the federal debt… It is the road to banana republic," she told CNBC. The signatories in full are: Andrew Bailey, governor of the Bank of England - Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank - Erik Thedéen, governor of Sveriges Riksbank - Christian Kettel Thomsen, chairman of the Danmarks Nationalbank - Martin Schlegel, chairman of the Swiss National Bank - Michele Bullock, governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia - Tiff Macklem, governor of the Bank of Canada - Chang Yong Rhee, governor of the Bank of Korea - Gabriel Galípolo, governor of the Banco Central do Brasil - François Villeroy de Galhau, chair of the Bank for International Settlements - Pablo Hernández de Cos, general manager of the Bank for International Settlements -

### 2. [Prosecutors seek death penalty for ex-South Korean president Yoon](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq6vyqq5r0do?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

Prosecutors seek death penalty for ex-South Korean president Yoon Prosecutors have asked for South Korea's former president Yoon Suk Yeol to be handed a death sentence if he is found guilty over his botched attempt to impose martial law. A court in Seoul heard closing arguments in Yoon's trial, in which he was accused of being the "ringleader of an insurrection". The charge stems from Yoon's attempt in December 2024 to impose military rule in South Korea - an act that lasted just hours but plunged the country into political turmoil. He was later impeached by parliament and detained to face trial. Yoon has denied the charges against him, arguing that martial law was a symbolic gesture to draw public attention to the wrongdoings of the opposition party. Leading an insurrection - the most serious charge against Yoon - carries the death penalty or life imprisonment and under South Korean law prosecutors must ask the judge for one or the other for the crime of insurrection. South Korea has not executed anyone in nearly 30 years. In 1996, former military dictator Chun Doo-hwan was given the death penalty for seizing power in a military coup in 1979, though his sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment. The prosecutors in Yoon's case argue that although no one was killed in his martial law attempt, Yoon's intent was no less violent. They called to the stand the military commander who testified that Yoon had ordered the arrest of lawmakers. They also presented as evidence the memo made by one of the planners of the martial law, a former military officer, containing the suggestion of "disposing" of hundreds of people including journalists, labour activists and lawmakers. Yoon's insurrection trial has been merged with those of two other senior figures in his administration, former defence minister Kim Yong-hyun and former police chief Cho Ji-ho. A verdict and sentencing for Yoon and the other defendants, if they are convicted, is expected at a later date - widely expected to be in February. Yoon has been detained for months while facing several criminal trials. Last month, prosecutors sought a 10-year prison term for Yoon for obstruction of justice and other charges related to his martial law attempt. On 3 December 2024, Yoon shocked the country - and the world - by declaring martial law over South Korea. He said at the time it was to protect the country from North Korean communist forces, but some saw it as a ploy by Yoon to get a grip on power amid domestic political woes. The short-lived martial law declaration sent South Korea into months of political turmoil, while Yoon became South Korea's first sitting president to be arrested and charged. South Korea's incumbent president, Lee Jae Myung, was elected in June following a snap election after Yoon's impeachment. Despite his downfall, Yoon retains loyal supporters in right-wing circles who see him as a martyr who dared to rail against the liberal Democratic Party led by Lee.

**Excerpt**

Cold weather and data centres drive up US greenhouse gas emissions A very cold start to 2025 and the growing power demands of data centres and cryptocurrencies saw US emissions of planet-warming gases rise for the first time in three years, a new analysis shows. Last year homes burned more gas for heating while the use of coal surged by 13% to meet rising electricity demands, the data finds. Although solar power also shot up last year, overall, greenhouse gas emissions went up by 2.4% after two years of decreases, outpacing the level of economic growth, according to estimates from the Rhodium Group. The authors say the policies of the Trump administration didn't "meaningfully impact" the rise in emissions but they expect this to change in the coming years. In the colder parts of the United States, most homes rely on natural gas and other fossil fuels for their heating. The low temperatures experienced in early 2025 saw consumption of these fuels increase by nearly 7% compared with the previous year. Extra electric power was also needed by the boom in data centres and cryptocurrency mining operations in places like Texas and the Ohio Valley region. The rising demand for power combined with the higher cost of gas was behind the 13% surge in US coal use last year. That was in marked contrast to both India and China, where coal use for electricity dropped 3% and 1.6% respectively as both countries added record amounts of wind and solar energy, according to an analysis for the website, Carbon Brief. "The grid decided to meet that additional load this year, in part with renewables, in part with fossil but because of higher natural gas prices, there was some fuel switching that saw marginally more coal than there was in 2024," said Michael Gaffney, from Rhodium Group, the report's lead author. Other observers see the high price of gas in the US as closely related to continuing large exports of gas to the rest of the world. "Higher natural gas prices means that finally, coal, which had been kind of driven to extinction by low natural gas prices, well [gas is] now so expensive that coal's worthwhile again," said Jesse Lee, from Climate Power, a US-based environmental campaign group. "And that's what is allowing coal to make this comeback." Since 2007 coal power generation in the US has shrunk by 64%, with last year's rise only the second in the last decade. Last year also saw a slowdown in the rate of coal plant retirements, as electricity companies delayed closures to meet demands. So is 2025 the start of the revival of coal? "It's more than just a blip," said Michael Gaffney. "This is a response to the demand growth in the sector, a lot of it is coming from data centres, cryptocurrency operations, other large load customers, and that demand growth is here to stay." Solar power also experienced a major growth spurt in the US last year, rising by 34%, the fastest rate since 2017. Transport in the US, by road, rail and air remains the largest source of warming gases, with road traffic volumes increasing for the fifth year in a row. However, emissions from this sector were virtually flat in 2025 due to increasing numbers of hybrid and electric vehicles on the roads. Hybrids, in particular, showed strong growth, up 25% compared to 2024. While President Trump has been forceful in his determination to rollback the climate-related policies of his predecessor, and to boost US extraction of fossil fuel, Rhodium analysts who carried out this report say those changes made little difference in 2025. Some others disagree. "There is a data centre explosion, that is somewhat independent of Trump," says Lee, of Climate Power. "You could argue maybe his policies haven't all kicked in full blast yet, but I don't think you can really divorce his natural gas exports and his blind support of AI and data centres from this dynamic that's driving up emissions."

### 4. [Niger revokes licences of tanker drivers who refuse to go to Mali amid jihadist blockade](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr578g7v082o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

Niger revokes licences of tanker drivers who refuse to go to Mali amid jihadist blockade Niger has revoked the licences of dozens of transport operators and drivers for refusing to deliver fuel to neighbouring Mali where they face possible attacks by jihadists. An al-Qaeda affiliate imposed a fuel blockade on Mali in September and began attacking petrol tankers on major highways. The landlocked country depends on fuel imports and in July had signed a deal with Niger to supply 85 million litres of fuel over six months to its vast, northern desert region, where various militant groups operate. Niger is an oil-producing country and a major ally of Mali - both run by military juntas which face jihadist violence. The fuel convoys from Niger making the journey crossing a route of 1,400km (870 miles) have faced jihadist attacks even under military escort. Last November, Niger delivered 82 fuel tankers to Mali, which managed to stabilise the energy supply hit by the recent blockade - as convoys travelling from Senegal and Ivory Coast have also been hit. Additional fuel shipments from Niger were expected in the following months, but plans were disrupted after drivers and transport operators refused to make the deliveries. This has prompted Niger's transport ministry to revoke the licences of 14 transport operators and 19 drivers for refusing to transport the fuel. "This refusal constitutes a serious violation of the legal and regulatory obligations in force," Niger Transport Minister Abdourahamane Amadou said in a statement dated 6 January that has just come to light. Another operator was handed a one-year suspension. "Those who are sanctioned must also surrender their transport documents and licences to the ministry," the statement said. It is the militant group Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM) that has imposed the blockade - broadening its years-long insurgency to include economic warfare. JNIM's fighters have kidnapped drivers and torched lorries. Last year, schools and universities across Mali were temporarily closed because of the severe fuel scarcity. The fuel shortage has sparked concern outside of Mali, with the US last November urging Americans not to travel to Mali and France advising its citizens in the West African country to leave. Mali's military government is led by Gen Assimi Goïta, who first seized power in a coup in 2020. He had popular support at the time - promising to deal with the long-running security crisis prompted by a separatist rebellion in the north by ethnic Tuaregs, which was then hijacked by Islamist militants. A UN peacekeeping mission and French forces were deployed in 2013 to deal with the escalating insurgency - both have left since the junta took over. It has hired Russian mercenaries to tackle the insecurity, though large parts of the country remain outside government control.

Hunt for gunman after Corsican exile is shot dead at mother's funeral Organised crime prosecutors on the French island of Corsica are investigating the killing of former separatist leader Alain Orsoni, who was shot dead while attending his mother's funeral. Orsoni, 71, who had been living in exile for years in Nicaragua, was a well-known figure in Corsica. It is thought he was hit in the chest by a single bullet fired by a gunman lying in wait as the funeral ceremony in the village of Vero ended on Monday afternoon. "It would appear he was hit by a long-range shot. He died pretty quickly from his injuries," said Corsican prosecutor Nicolas Septe. "We'd just finished burying Alain's mother - it was a moment of pain and grief," said Father Roger-Dominique Polge who had led the funeral service. "Suddenly we hear a gunshot and Alain falls down dead. In the middle of a cemetery, after a religious ceremony, I ask where are we, what kind of home are we living in? It's as if Corsica is worse than Sicily - it's unimaginable." No motive is yet known but Orsoni was for decades a high-profile figure in Corsican society and his graveyard murder in his native village shines a light on the criminal clans that have blighted the island. The investigation into his murder is being handled by a newly created national anti-organised crime prosecutor alongside the Marseille-based specialised regional crime office. A police source told Le Monde newspaper there were similarities with recent gangland killings targeting people linked to Orsoni's son, Guy. In 2023, two of Guy Orsoni's associates were shot dead, both by a gunman firing from some distance away. Guy Orsoni is himself serving a 13-year jail term for the attempted murder of a member of the so-called Petit Bar gang in 2018. Alain Orsoni led a storied life in Corsica and abroad. Renowned for his good looks and rich singing voice, he became attracted to Corsican nationalism in the 1970s and took part in a gun attack in front of the Iranian embassy in 1980. Three years later his brother was kidnapped and presumed murdered. "Father, brother and son all found themselves thrust over time into the heart of politics and criminal cases," criminologist Alain Bauer told Ouest-France newspaper. Alain Orsoni later founded the separatist Movement for Self-Determination (MPA), which won four seats in elections in 1992. He was unable to take up his seat because of campaign irregularities and later spent time in jail for a series of offences. Amid violent splits among Corsican nationalist leaders, he left the island for Central America in 1996, eventually returning to become president of football club AC Ajaccio in 2008. Weeks after his return, police thwarted a plot to kill him by the Petit Bar gang. His role at AC Ajaccio ended in 2015 but he returned as club president in 2022, before returning to exile in Nicaragua and then resigning from his post in September last year. He was long aware of the risk to his life and, after the killing of four of his associates over a two-year period, he told Le Figaro newspaper in 2012 that he had bought an armoured car under pressure from his family after he was targeted in 2008. "I'm not afraid of dying. I don't wake up every morning thinking I'm going to be killed. I live a normal life, without a squad of bodyguards," he said. "I'm portrayed as a godfather, even though I don't even own a business on Corsica. As former head of a nationalist movement for 15 years I wasn't exactly a saint. But to depict me as a dangerous wheeler-dealer? That's a joke."

**Excerpt**

Senator Mark Kelly sues Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth over attempted demotion US Senator Mark Kelly has sued Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, arguing that the Pentagon illegally tried to demote him in retaliation for criticising the Trump administration. Kelly, a former Navy captain, drew the ire of Hegseth and President Donald Trump after he filmed a video that told military personnel they could refuse unlawful orders. Trump accused Kelly of "sedition", and Hegseth said he would open proceedings to lower Kelly's retirement grade, which could result in a reduction in his pay. The actions violated Kelly's right to free speech and due process, and did not follow military procedure, his case alleges. The defence department was "aware of the litigation," a spokesperson said. "As a matter of policy, the Department does not comment on ongoing litigation," the spokesperson said. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Kelly had a prominent career as an astronaut before being elected to the US Senate for Arizona in 2020. He also founded a gun safety group along with his wife, former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot in the head at an event in 2011 and survived. He staked out a position as a centrist Democrat focused on defence, and has criticised Trump's use of National Guard troops to patrol US cities. Trump's deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles, Portland, Washington DC, and elsewhere has sparked major court battles. The Trump administration argues that the forces are necessary to suppress crime, and to protect federal immigration agents as they conduct sweeps in major US cities. In November, Kelly, along with five other Democrats, filmed a video that told military personnel: "Our laws are clear: you can refuse illegal orders." The video irked Trump, who posted "LOCK THEM UP???" on Truth Social. The president's account also reshared another user's post, that read, "HANG THEM GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD !!" Trump later clarified to Fox News: "I'm not threatening death, but I think they're in serious trouble." Hegseth then announced he would open retirement-grade determination proceedings against Kelly and issue a formal letter of censure. He described Kelly's comments as "seditious in nature" and a violation of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The case filed by Kelly argues that Hegseth "is disciplining Senator Kelly solely for the content and viewpoint of his political speech". Kelly also alleges that Hegseth did not have a legal basis to open a review of Kelly's retirement grade. "Nothing in the statute authorizes the Department of Defense to reopen that determination based on post-retirement political speech - and if it did, it would raise serious constitutional concerns and subject all of the nation's retired veterans to an ever-present threat against their retirement," the case states.

**Excerpt**

Trump to meet Venezuelan opposition leader Machado at the White House Venezuelan opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner María Corina Machado will meet President Donald Trump on Thursday, the White House has confirmed. The visit comes just weeks after Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro was seized in Caracas by US forces. But Trump declined to endorse Machado, whose movement claimed victory in 2024's widely contested elections, as its new leader. The US instead backed Delcy Rodríguez, Maduro's former vice-president. Machado said last week she hoped to thank Trump personally for the action against Maduro and would like to give the Nobel Prize to him. Trump called it "a great honour", but the Nobel Committee later clarified that it was not transferable. Earlier, Trump had expressed displeasure over Machado's decision to accept the Nobel Peace Prize, an honour the president has long coveted. Asked on Friday whether receiving Machado's prize might change his view of her role in Venezuela, the president said: "She might be involved in some aspect of it." "I will have to speak to her. I think it's very nice that she wants to come in. And that's what I understand the reason is," he said. Earlier this month, after Maduro's ouster, Trump had said Machado "doesn't have the support within, or the respect within, the country". "She's a very nice woman, but she doesn't have the respect," he said. The US has so far backed Delcy Rodríguez as Venezuela's interim president. Trump describes Rodríguez as an "ally", and she has not been charged by US officials with any crimes. "Delcy Rodríguez and her team have been very cooperative with the United States," White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Monday. But Machado has maintained that her coalition should "absolutely" be in charge of the country. Machado has said nobody trusted Rodríguez, telling CBS that the interim leader was "one of the main architects... of repression for innocent people" in the South American country. "Everybody in Venezuela and abroad knows perfectly who she is and the role she has played," Machado said. The former legislator, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last year, described US military action in Venezuela as "a major step towards restoring prosperity and rule of law and democracy in Venezuela". Rodríguez has rebuffed claims by Trump that the US was in charge of Venezuela. "The Venezuelan government rules our country, and no-one else does," she said in a televised speech. "There is no external agent governing Venezuela."

**Excerpt**

Lyse Doucet: Iran's rulers face biggest challenge since 1979 revolution Iran's rulers are confronting their most serious challenge since their own 1979 revolution. They're now countering on an unprecedented scale - a ferocious security crackdown and near total internet shutdown has been unleashed on a scale unseen in previous crises. Some of the streets once engulfed by a roar of anger against the regime are now starting to go silent. "On Friday it was extremely crowded - the crowd was unbelievable - and there was a lot of shooting. Then Saturday night it became much, much quieter," a resident of Tehran told BBC Persian. "You would have to have a death wish to go out now," one Iranian journalist reflected. This time, an internal upheaval is also compounded by an external threat, with President Trump's repeated warnings of military action coming seven months after the US carried out strikes on key nuclear facilities during a 12-day war between Iran and Israel, which left the regime weakened. But, to use an analogy often used by the American leader, that has also given Iran "another card" to play. Trump now says Tehran has called to go back to the negotiating table. But Iran doesn't have a good hand: President Trump says he may still have to take some kind of action before any meeting; talks won't take all the searing heat out of this unrest. And Iran won't capitulate to what have been the US's maximalist demands, including zero nuclear enrichment, which would cross red lines which lie at the very heart of this theocracy's strategic doctrine. Whatever the pressure of this moment, there's no sign Iran's leaders are changing course. "Their inclination is to clamp down, to try to survive this moment, and then to figure out where they go from here," says Vali Nasr from the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, author of the book Iran's Grand Strategy. "But given their straits with the US, with Israel, with sanctions, even if they quell these protests, they don't have many options to improve the lives of Iranians." This week may decide the momentum in this moment - whether Iran, and the wider region, is plunged into another bout of military attacks; whether brute force has completely put down these protests – as it has in the past. Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told diplomats in Tehran today that "the situation is now under total control". Outside, in the bright light of day, the streets of Tehran were filled with the crowds the government called on to come out and reclaim the streets from protesters. Five days into a comprehensive communications blackout, a more chilling picture still sneaks out into the world through Starlink satellite terminals, Iranian technical creativity, and courage. Doctors' accounts of hospitals overwhelmed by casualties, grim videos of open-air mortuaries dotted by long lines of black body bags, voice notes sent to journalists at the BBC Persian Service expressing shock and fear. The numbers rise. In the last wave of unrest in 2022 and 2023, which lasted more than six months, around 500 deaths were recorded by human rights groups and more than 20,000 arrests. This time, within a few weeks, reports say the death toll already climbs far higher and more than 20,000 have been taken in so far. The government doesn't deny the bloodshed; state TV is also airing images of makeshift mortuaries, even admitting some protesters have been killed. The streets of Iran have been on fire. Government buildings have been set alight as anger burned. They are symbols of the system, but attacks on public property are condemned by the government as the work of "terrorists and rioters. " Legal language has also hardened in this time - "vandals " will be charged with "waging war against God" and face the death penalty. The government puts the main blame on foreign enemies - code name for Israel and the US - for an internal upsurge. This time, their accusation is also fuelled by the clear extent of infiltration by Israel's Mossad security agency during their 12-day war last year. With every new eruption of unrest in Iran, the same questions are asked: how far and wide do these protests reach; who's taking to the streets and squares; how will the authorities respond? This latest wave has been unique in many ways. It began in a most ordinary way. On 28 December, traders selling imported electronic goods in Tehran were jolted by the sudden currency collapse; they shuttered their shops, went on strike, and urged others in the bazaar to follow suit. The government's initial response was quick and conciliatory. President Masoud Pezeshkian promised dialogue and acknowledged "legitimate demands" in a country where inflation soars near 50%, and currency depreciations play havoc with people's hardscrabble lives. A new monthly allowance, amounting to about $7 (£5), was soon deposited in everyone's bank account to help ease the pain. But prices shot up further; the wave of unrest swelled. Less than three weeks later, Iranians were marching everywhere - from small deprived provincial towns to major cities, chanting for economic and political change. There are no quick and simple fixes now; it's the system. Iran is broken by years of crippling international sanctions, mismanagement and corruption, deep seated rage over restrictions on social freedoms, and agony over the cost of this prolonged standoff with the West. But, so far, the centre appears to be holding. "The most important element still missing from a full collapse is repressive forces deciding that they no longer benefit from, and are no longer willing to kill for, the regime," explains Karim Sadjadpour, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment in Washington. Before this crisis erupted, the most powerful players in Iran's ruling circles were known to be bitterly divided on key issues: if and how to resume the ill-fated negotiations with the US over a new nuclear deal, as well as how to restore strategic deterrence after the blows to its military proxies and political partners during the Gaza war. But survival of the system, their system, matters above all else. Ultimate authority still rests with the ailing 86-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, but he's encircled by his most loyal defenders, among them the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), who now hold sway over the economy, politics and security of the Islamic Republic. President Trump's almost daily threats are known to have concentrated minds at the top. It has also provoked speculation far and wide over the impact of any outside intervention. Military action could bolster the protesters; it could also backfire. "The primary impact would be to shore up elite unity and suppress fractures within the regime at a moment of heightened vulnerability," says Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa programme at the London-based think tank Chatham House. One of the loudest Iranian voices calling on President Trump to intervene has been the exiled former crown prince Reza Pahlavi, whose father was overthrown as Iran's shah in the 1979 Islamic revolution. But his call, and his close ties to Israel, are controversial. Other voices, from Nobel peace laureate Narges Mohammadi - still imprisoned in Iran, to award-winning filmmaker Jafar Panahi, insist that change must be peaceful, and must come from within. In this current unrest, Pahlavi has shown his capacity to help galvanise and give shape to this uprising. His appeals at the start of last week for coordinated chanting appear to have drawn more people out into the bitter winter cold. It's impossible to know the depth of his support, and whether this profound yearning for change leads some to hold fast to a familiar symbol. Iran's pre-revolutionary flag, with its lion and sun, has been unfurled again. Pahlavi emphasises he's not trying to bring back the monarchy but to lead a democratic transition; but in the past he has not been a unifying figure in the divided Iranian diaspora. Fears of collapse and chaos, financial woes, and more, also weigh on the minds of Iranians including those who still back the ruling clerics. Reform not revolution is on some minds. History tells us that when fervour and force meet on the streets, change can come from above, or below. It is always unpredictable - and often perilous.

What countries do business with Iran and what could US tariffs mean? US President Donald Trump has said countries doing business with Iran will face a 25% tariff on trade they do with America. It comes as Iran cracks down on anti-government protests, with thousands of people feared dead. Trump has used the threat of tariffs before to exert pressure on countries. Here's what we know so far. What has Trump said? On Monday Trump posted on Truth Social: "Effective immediately, any country doing business with the Islamic Republic of Iran will pay a tariff of 25% on any and all business being done with the United States of America. "This order is final and conclusive. Thank you for your attention to this matter!" The president has not gone into any detail beyond that. What countries trade with Iran? Of the 100-plus countries that trade with Iran, China is its biggest export partner. In the year to October 2025, it bought more than $14bn (£10.4bn) of products from Iran, according to figures from Trade Data Monitor which are based on statistics from the Islamic Republic of Iran Customs Administration. China is followed by Iraq, which received $10.5bn worth of goods from its neighbour. Iran also counts the United Arab Emirates and Turkey among its largest customers. In fact, exports from Iran to Turkey jumped substantially from $4.7bn in 2024 to $7.3bn last year. Almost all of Iran's top 10 exports are fuel-related - it is one of the world's largest oil producers. It also ships food to other nations, including pistachios and tomatoes. But it is, by far, a much larger buyer of staples from its trade partners. Food makes up about a third of Iran's imports, in particular corn, rice, sunflower seeds and oils as well as soybeans. But Iran's biggest import is gold. In the 12 months to October, it imported $6.7bn worth of gold compared to $4.8bn in the year before. How could the tariff be implemented? Trump's post says the 25% tariff is "effective immediately", and the order is "final and conclusive". However, there has been no detail as yet from the White House as to how it would work in practice, or which countries specifically it would apply to. We don't know if it would cover all countries who deal with Iran or just its biggest trade partners. It is also unclear whether the 25% tax will come on top of existing tariffs the Trump administration has already imposed. The US has also not specified under what law the new tariff would be introduced. Sweeping tariffs announced last April were imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. But this is currently subject to legal challenge - with the US Supreme Court due to rule as soon as Wednesday. On Monday Trump said the US would be "screwed" if these tariffs aren't upheld. Enforcing the proposed tariff could be difficult. Iran is estimated to have made billions from oil exports in 2024 using a fleet of shadow ships that are hard to track and by selling its oil in Chinese yuan rather than the more traditional US dollars. How might this affect US-China relations? On the face of it, Trump's announcement risks reigniting the trade conflict between the US and China. If the president meant what he wrote, it would mean Chinese goods sent to the US should immediately be subject to the new 25% tariff. However, these are already subject to an average tariff rate of 30.8%, according to Bloomberg Economics. So will the new tariff be imposed in addition to the current levy? Or will allowances be made? China has previously shown a willingness to push back against what it perceives as disproportionate action by the US. It has done so partly by introducing its own tariffs, but more importantly by announcing restrictions on exports of rare earths, which the US desperately needs for its tech-heavy industries. China currently dominates the global supply, giving it crucial leverage, which helped Beijing reach a temporary trade truce with the US in November that defused tensions. So introducing a new 25% tariff on China now would be highly provocative, and Beijing has already warned it will "take all necessary measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests". Analysts question whether it will actually happen, given the real-world impact of previous Trump announcements not always matching the initial headline. What is happening with Iran's economy? Iran's huge oil reserves make it one of the world's top 10 oil producers and it should be a source of great wealth. However, its economy has been crippled by years of mismanagement of the public finances, a fall in oil sales and biting international sanctions. Many of the country's 92 million people are struggling to afford basics such as food and utilities, and the cost of living is at the heart of the protests seen in recent weeks. Household spending has fallen compared to its 2008 peak, according to BBC analysis, and government restrictions on women's ability to work has pushed the employment rate down from 42.4% two decades ago to around 37%. At the same time things have become more expensive thanks to high inflation, which hit 48.4% in October amid government policy changes that have led to the value of the rial to fall against the US dollar. That makes imports even more expensive. Those are even more important because significant under-investment in the electricity and water systems mean they are unreliable and have undermined government pledges to increase domestic production of everything from food to consumer goods. A reduction of fuel subsidies in December and potentially even less foreign trade due to these latest tariffs means inflation could yet climb higher and push the economy even closer towards collapse.
