More than 2,000 people reported killed at Iran protests as Trump says 'help is on its way' More than 2,000 people have been killed during the violent crackdown by security forces on protests in Iran, a human rights group has said, as President Trump promised Iranians that help was "on its way". The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) reported that it had so far confirmed the killing of 1,850 protesters, 135 people affiliated with the government and nine uninvolved civilians as well as nine children over the last 17 days despite an internet blackout. An Iranian official also told Reuters that 2,000 people had been killed but that "terrorists" were to blame. Trump said Iranian authorities would "pay a big price" for the killings and urged people to "keep protesting". He has been weighing military and other options in response to the crackdown, having already announced 25% tariffs on any country trading with Iran. The protests, which have reportedly spread to 180 cities and towns in all 31 provinces, were sparked by anger over the collapse of the Iranian currency and soaring cost of living. They quickly widened into demands for political change and became one of the most serious challenges to the clerical establishment since the 1979 Islamic revolution. The protests escalated significantly last Thursday and were met with deadly force by authorities, masked by a near total shutdown of the internet and communication services. HRANA said on Tuesday afternoon that, as well as confirming the killing of at least 2,003 people during the unrest, it was also reviewing reports of another 779 deaths. "We're horrified, but we still think the number is conservative," Deputy Director Skylar Thompson told the Associated Press. Another group, Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR), meanwhile said it had confirmed the killing of at least 734 protesters. Its director, Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam, told AFP news agency that the figures were "based on information received from fewer than half of the country's provinces and fewer than 10% of Iran's hospitals", adding: "The real number of those killed is likely in the thousands." Reuters said the unnamed Iranian official who put the death toll at about 2,000 had not given a breakdown of the figure. However, it added, he said "terrorists" were behind the deaths of both protesters and security personnel. It is difficult to gauge the true scale of bloodshed because, like other international news organisations, the BBC is not able to report from inside the country. However, videos posted online on Sunday showed people searching for the bodies of their loved ones at the Kahrizak Forensic Centre in Tehran. The BBC counted at least 180 shrouded bodies and body bags in the footage. Around 50 bodies were visible in another video from the facility shared on Monday. "My friend went there [Kahrizak] to look for his brother, and he forgot his own sorrow," an activist told BBC Persian on Monday. "They piled up bodies from every neighbourhood, like Saadatabad, Naziabad, Sattarkhan. So you go to your address pile and search there. You don't know a fraction of the level of violence that's been used." Hospitals in the capital have also reportedly been overwhelmed by the number of casualties. Prof Shahram Kordasti, an Iranian oncologist based in London, told the BBC's Newsday programme on Tuesday that the last message he had received from a colleague in Tehran said: "In most hospitals, it's like a warzone. We are short of supplies, short of blood." Other doctors at "two to three hospitals" had also said they had treated hundreds of injured or dead people, he added. An Iranian living in Rasht, near the Caspian Sea coast, described the city as unrecognisable. "Everywhere is burnt with fire," they said. Not long after HRANA released its latest death toll, President Trump wrote on Truth Social: "Iranian Patriots, KEEP PROTESTING - TAKE OVER YOUR INSTITUTIONS!!! Save the names of the killers and abusers. They will pay a big price." "I have cancelled all meetings with Iranian Officials until the senseless killing of protesters STOPS. HELP IS ON ITS WAY. MIGA!!!," he added, using the acronym for a US-based Iranian opposition slogan, "Make Iran Great Again". Trump's national security team was expected to hold a meeting at the White House on Tuesday to discuss options for Iran. On Monday night, US defence officials told the BBC's US partner, CBS news, that Trump had been briefed on a wide range of covert and military tools, including long-range missile strikes, cyber operations and psychological campaign responses. At the same time, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told Al Jazeera that Iran was ready for diplomacy but also for other options, including "if the US wanted to test the military option which it had tested in the past". In June, the US carried out air strikes on key Iranian nuclear facilities during a 12-day war between Iran and Israel. Araghchi also said that Iranian government had been in dialogue with protesters, but that it had been forced to take action after "trained terrorist groups" run from abroad infiltrated the demonstrations and targeted security forces. His comments echoed those of the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who told supporters at state-organised rallies across the country on Monday that they had "neutralised the plans by foreign enemies that were meant to be performed by domestic mercenaries". Also on Tuesday, UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper summoned the Iranian ambassador to protest in response at what she called "the horrendous and brutal killing of Iranian protesters". The UN human rights chief Volker Türk urged Iranian authorities to halt all forms of violence and repression against peaceful protesters immediately, his office said. He added that the labelling of protesters as "terrorists" to justify violence was unacceptable and that it was "extremely worrying" to see statements from Iranian officials indicating the possibility of the death penalty being used against protesters through expedited trials. Judiciary chief Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei said on Monday that those involved in the unrest would be "dealt with seriously and severely". And prosecutors have said some will be charged with "enmity against God", a national security offence that carries the death penalty. More than 16,780 protesters have been arrested during the unrest, according to HRANA. A 26-year-old man detained last Thursday has already been sentenced to death, according to his family and Norway-based Kurdish human rights group Hengaw. A relative of Erfan Soltani's family told BBC Persian that "in an extremely rapid process, within just two days, the court issued a death sentence, and the family was told that he is due to be executed [this] Wednesday". "We have never witnessed a case move so quickly," Awyar Shekhi of Hengaw told the BBC. "The government is using every tactic they know to suppress people and spread fear." Speaking to the BBC's US news partner CBS later on Tuesday, Trump said the US would take "very strong action" if Iran's authorities started hanging protesters. "If they hang them, you're going to see some things... We will take very strong action if they do such a thing," he said. Türk also demanded that Iranian authorities restore full access to the internet and other communication services. Some international calls from Iran went through on Tuesday, but the internet shutdown has now passed 120 hours, according to monitor NetBlocks. One person living near Tehran with access via the Starlink satellite service told BBC Persian that there were "checkpoints in every block", where cars and the phones of their occupants were being inspected by security forces. New videos of protests in recent days have also emerged, with BBC Persian verifying those filmed in the central city of Arak and the western cities of Tabriz, Urmia and Khorramabad. In the footage from Khorramabad, gunfire can be heard during clashes between security forces and protesters, some of whom are throwing stones. The protesters chant slogans "Death to the dictator" - a reference to Ayatollah Khamenei - and "Reza Shah, may your soul rest in peace" - referring to the late monarch Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who was overthrown in the 1979 revolution and whose son Reza lives in exile.

Bowen: Authoritarian regimes die gradually then suddenly, but Iran is not there yet How does an authoritarian regime die? As Ernest Hemingway famously said about going broke – gradually then suddenly. The protesters in Iran and their supporters abroad were hoping that the Islamic regime in Tehran was at the suddenly stage. The signs are, if it is dying, it is still at gradual. The last two weeks of unrest add up to a big crisis for the regime. Iranian anger and frustration have exploded into the streets before, but the latest explosion comes on top of all the military blows inflicted on Iran in the last two years by the US and Israel. But more significant for hard-pressed Iranians struggling to feed their families has been the impact of sanctions. In the latest blow for the Iranian economy, all the UN sanctions lifted under the now dead 2015 nuclear deal were reimposed by the UK, Germany and France in September. In 2025 food price inflation was more than 70%. The currency, the rial, reached a record low in December. While the Iranian regime is under huge pressure, the evidence is that it's not about to die. Crucially, the security forces remain loyal. Since the Islamic revolution in 1979 the Iranian authorities have spent time and money creating an elaborate and ruthless network of coercion and repression. In the last two weeks, the regime's forces obeyed orders to shoot their fellow citizens in the streets. The result is that the demonstrations of the last few weeks have ended - as far as we can tell in a country whose rulers continue to impose a communications black out. At the forefront of the suppression of protest is the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), the most important single organisation in the country. It has the specific task of defending the ideology and system of government of the Islamic revolution of 1979, answering directly to the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The IRGC is estimated to have something like 150,000 men under arms, operating as a parallel force to Iran's conventional armed military. It is also a major player in the Iranian economy. A potent mix of power, money, corruption and ideology means it has every reason to defend the system. The IRGC has an auxiliary force, the Basij militia, a volunteer paramilitary organisation. It claims to have millions of members. Some western estimates put its active duty contingent in the hundreds of thousands, still a very substantial total. The Basij are at the sharp end of the regime's crackdowns against protesters. I saw the IRGC and the Basij in action in Tehran in 2009, as they moved to suppress huge demonstrations that followed a disputed presidential election. Basij volunteers lined the streets armed with rubber truncheons and wooden clubs. Behind them were uniformed men with automatic weapons. Motorcycle squads roared around Tehran's broad avenues, descending on groups trying to protest. In less than two weeks, protests that had choked the streets were reduced to small groups of students chanting slogans and setting fire to rubbish skips. At dusk, people went to their balconies and rooftops to chant God is greatest, as their parents had against the Shah, until that petered out too. The seeming resilience of the internal security forces does not mean that the supreme leader or his lieutenants can or will relax. US President Donald Trump is still threatening to take action. The millions of Iranians who want the fall of the regime must be seething with resentment and anger. In Tehran, the government and the supreme leader appear to be looking for ways to release some of the pressure they are facing. Bellicose official rhetoric is mixed with an offer to resume negotiations with the US. It is hard to see how the two sides can make a deal over Iran's nuclear plans and ballistic missile programme that have defeated earlier rounds of talks. But negotiations could buy time for Iran, especially if Trump can be convinced that a deal, however unlikely, is possible. As part of his pressure campaign, Trump says that he will slap a 25% tariff on the goods of any country that does business with Iran. Again, it is hard to see how that might work. China buys most of Iran's oil. Trump and China's President Xi Jinping agreed a truce in their trade war last autumn, with a summit due to be held in Beijing in April. The summit will deal with the biggest issues facing the world's two superpowers. Would Trump want to jeopardise or disrupt the summit simply to keep up pressure on Iran? In Tehran the biggest priority for the ageing Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei is to preserve the Islamic Republic's system of rule. More eruptions of protest can expect a severe response. An advantage for the regime is lack of coherent leadership among protesters. The eldest son of the Shah deposed by the revolution almost half a century ago has been trying to be the leader they lack. His appeal seems to be limited by his family's history and his close links with Israel. One lesson that might worry the clerics and military men in Tehran comes from their erstwhile ally, former President Bashar al-Assad of Syria. He seemed to have won his war, and was being slowly rehabilitated by Saudi Arabia and the Arab League when he was faced at the end of 2024 with a well organised rebel offensive. Both Russia and Iran, his two most important allies were neither willing or perhaps able to save him. Within days, Assad and his family were flying into exile in Moscow. An authoritarian regime decays gradually, then suddenly. When Assad's Syria collapsed, it went very fast. Another example that might be studied in Tehran is the downfall in 2011 of President Ben Ali of Tunisia, when the army moved to protect protesters from the internal security forces. The fall of Ben Ali precipitated the resignation of Hosni Mubarak of Egypt. He might have survived huge demonstrations had not the armed forces decided that to save their own position he had to go. Could that happen in Iran? Perhaps. Not yet. Opponents of the Islamic regime will hope for more pressure at home and abroad and the emergence of credible leadership, so that the process of decay will speed up, accelerating from gradual, to sudden.

**Excerpt**

We choose Denmark over US, Greenland's PM says Greenland's prime minister has said his people would choose Denmark over the US if they were asked to make such a choice "here and now". Jens-Frederik Nielsen's remark at a joint news conference with Denmark's prime minister is the strongest by a representative of the semi-autonomous Danish territory since US President Donald Trump renewed his plan to annex it. Trump says the US needs to "own" Greenland to defend against Russia and China. The White House has suggested buying the island, but not ruled out the use of force to annex it. Denmark is a fellow Nato member and Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has warned that military force would spell the end of the trans-Atlantic defence alliance. Asked later on Tuesday what he made of Nielsen's comments, Trump said: "That's their problem, I disagree with him... That's going to be a big problem for him." Despite being the most sparsely populated territory, Greenland's location between North America and the Arctic makes it well placed for early warning systems in the event of missile attacks, and for monitoring vessels in the region. Trump has repeatedly said that Greenland is vital to US national security, claiming without evidence that it was "covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place". The US already has more than 100 military personnel permanently stationed at its Pituffik base in Greenland's north-western tip - a facility that has been operated by the US since World War Two. Under existing agreements with Denmark, the US has the power to bring as many troops as it wants to Greenland. But Trump told reporters in Washington last week that a lease agreement was not good enough - the US "had to have ownership" and "Nato's got to understand that". At the news conference in the Danish capital Copenhagen, Frederiksen did not mince her words as she condemned the "completely unacceptable pressure from our closest ally". She warned that "there are many indications that the most challenging part is ahead of us". The Greenlandic prime minister said they were "facing a geopolitical crisis", but the island's position was clear: "If we have to choose between the United States and Denmark here and now, we choose Denmark," he said. "One thing must be clear to everyone. Greenland does not want to be owned by the United States. Greenland does not want to be governed by the United States. Greenland does not want to be part of the United States." The Copenhagen news conference comes a day before the Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen and his Greenlandic counterpart Vivian Motzfeldt are due to travel to the US to meet Vice-President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Denmark's Nato allies - major European countries as well as Canada - have rallied to its support this week with statements reaffirming that "only Denmark and Greenland can decide on matters concerning their relations". Stressing they were as keen as the US on Arctic security, they have said this must be achieved by allies, including the US, "collectively". They also called for "upholding the principles of the UN Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders". Concerns over the future of the territory resurfaced after Trump's use of military force against Venezuela on Saturday to seize its president, Nicolás Maduro. Trump previously made an offer to buy the island in 2019, during his first presidential term, only to be told it was not for sale. In recent years, there has been increased interest in Greenland's natural resources - including rare earth minerals, uranium and iron - which are becoming easier to access as its ice melts due to climate change. Scientists think it could also have significant oil and gas reserves.

Republicans vow to hold Bill Clinton in contempt as he skips Epstein testimony A Republican lawmaker is vowing to begin contempt-of-Congress proceedings against former President Bill Clinton after he failed to show up on Tuesday to testify before a committee investigating Jeffrey Epstein. House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer told reporters he would start proceedings against Clinton next week, and could do the same against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if she fails to answer questions on Wednesday. The committee had issued subpoenas for both Clintons to testify about the late convicted sex offender. Lawyers for the Clintons called the subpoenas "unenforceable", and said they had already provided the "limited information" they had about Epstein. Bill Clinton has never been accused of wrongdoing by survivors of Epstein's abuse, and has denied knowledge of his sex offending. In a statement on Tuesday, Comer said the subpoenas to the Clintons were voted on in a "bipartisan manner". "We communicated with President Clinton's legal team for months now, giving them opportunity after opportunity to come in, to give us a day, and they continue to delay, delay, delay, to the point where we had no idea whether they're going to show up today or not," he said. The Clintons contended the subpoenas - legal orders to provide testimony - "are nothing more than a ploy to attempt to embarrass political rivals, as President Trump has directed". In a letter to Comer, lawyers for the Clintons said they had communicated "proactively and voluntarily" with the committee and that the subpoenas were "untethered to a valid legislative purpose, unwarranted because they do not seek pertinent information, and an unprecedented infringement on the separation of powers". Bill Clinton appears with Epstein and at the late financier's estate in photographs that were recently released by the US Department of Justice after Congress passed a law requiring the agency to release material related to investigations of Epstein. One picture shows the former president swimming in a pool, and another shows him lying on his back with his hands behind his head in what appears to be a hot tub. Clinton was photographed with Epstein several times over the 1990s and early 2000s, before Epstein was arrested for sex-trafficking. Clinton spokesman Angel Ureña said when the photos were released last month that they were decades old and Clinton stopped associating with Epstein before his crimes came to light. A spokesperson has previously acknowledged that Bill Clinton took four trips with staff on Epstein's private plane in 2002 and 2003, and met with Epstein in New York in 2002. Clinton also visited Epstein's New York apartment around that time. Citing flight logs, US media have previously reported Clinton flew on Epstein's jet more than two dozen times, occasionally without his Secret Service detail. Congress has the authority to detain someone until they comply with a subpoena, send a contempt certification to the justice department for prosecution or ask a court to force compliance. "If the court finds that the party is legally obligated to comply, continued non-compliance may result in the party being held in contempt of court," according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. "Where the target of the subpoena is an executive branch official, civil enforcement may be the only practical means by which Congress can effectively ensure compliance with its own subpoena." Criminal contempt of Congress is a misdemeanour offence punishable by a fine up to $100,000 (£74,500) and imprisonment up to a year. Over the last year, lawmakers from both parties have pushed to learn about Epstein's associations with powerful people and passed a law demanding that the justice department release all files from federal investigations into the sex offender by the middle of December. After the department only released a portion of the files, the legislation's authors - Republican Thomas Massie and Democrat Ro Khanna - went to court last week and asked a federal judge to appoint a special master to make sure the government complies with its requirements.

**Excerpt**

Controversial Dilbert cartoonist Scott Adams dies aged 68 Scott Adams, the US cartoonist who wrote and illustrated the comic strip Dilbert, has died of cancer at the age of 68. His ex-wife Shelly Miles announced his death on Tuesday during a live stream of his podcast, Real Coffee with Scott Adams. The satirical cartoon strip - about a competent but frustrated engineer and his dysfunctional workplace environment - was first published in 1989, and went on to feature in more than 2,000 newspapers in 65 countries. The character also later appeared in books, an animated TV series and video game. But in 2023, his comic strip was cancelled by newspapers including the Washington Post after Adams was accused of making racist comments about black people. Adams called black Americans a "hate group" and suggested white Americans "get the hell away from black people," in response to a conservative organisation's poll purporting to show that many African-Americans do not think it is OK to be white. He later defended his comments and said that he had been using hyperbole to make a point, adding that he disavowed racists and that media reports had ignored the context of his comments. US President Donald Trump paid tribute to Adams on Truth Social, following news of his death: "Sadly, the Great Influencer, Scott Adams, has passed away. He was a fantastic guy, who liked and respected me when it wasn't fashionable to do so. "He bravely fought a long battle against a terrible disease," Trump wrote. A tearful Shelly told listeners at the start of Adams's latest podcast on Tuesday: "He's not with us anymore." She then read out a posthumous message from Adams: "I had an amazing life, I gave it everything I had. "If I got any benefits from my work, I'm asking that you pay it forward as best as you can. That's the legacy I want. "Be useful, and please know I loved you all to the very end." In his later career, Adams - also a trained hypnotist - wrote self-help books including How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big, Win Bigly, Loserthink and Reframe Your Brain. He had been receiving end-of-life care at his home after the prostate cancer, which he first revealed he had in May 2025, spread to his bones. On 1 January this year, he told listeners that the chances of him making a recovery were unlikely. "I'll give you any updates if that changes, but it won't," he said. "So there's no chance that I'll get my feeling back in my legs, and I've got some ongoing heart failure, which is making it difficult to breathe sometimes during the day. "However, you should prepare yourself that January will probably be a month of transition, one way or another."

**Excerpt**

Trump administration moves to end deportation protection for Somalis The Trump administration is ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Somali immigrants, making it easier to deport thousands of people from the US. "Country conditions in Somalia have improved to the point that it no longer meets the law's requirement," Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said. TPS prevents US officials from deporting immigrants to countries deemed unsafe. Starting March 17, around 2,500 Somalis will lose their work authorisations and legal status, making them eligible for deportation. President Donald Trump has made it known he does not want Somali immigrants in the US, and has launched a major effort in Minneapolis to detain and deport people in the country illegally. "Temporary means temporary," Noem said in a statement to the BBC. "Further, allowing Somali nationals to remain temporarily in the United States is contrary to our national interests. We are putting Americans first." Congress established TPS in 1990 to give refuge to people from countries that experienced war or environmental disasters. Immigrants with TPS authorisation are typically allowed to live and work legally in the US. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) told the BBC that there are 2,471 Somali nationals with TPS, and 1,383 people with pending applications. DHS responded to an online post about the announcement that the protective status was ending for those people with a Trump portrait carrying the caption: "I am the captain now." Noem last month announced a surge of immigration officers in Minnesota, home to a large Somali diaspora community and where a sprawling federal fraud investigation found problems in the state's childcare industry, which the administration has linked to Somali immigrants. Jonathan Ross, an immigration enforcement agent, fatally shot US citizen Renee Good in her car last week during the Minneapolis operation sparking large protests locally and nationally. The Trump administration says the agent acted in self-defence but local officials insist the woman posed no danger. Trump has for months said he wants Somali immigrants to leave, saying they should "go back to where they came from" and "their country is no good for a reason". Trump also said the US would "go the wrong way if we keep taking in garbage into our country". Ahead of Tuesday's announcement, Trump also posted online saying "FEAR NOT, GREAT PEOPLE OF MINNESOTA, THE DAY OF RECKONING & RETRIBUTION IS COMING!" TPS for Somalia was first designated in 1991 by Republican President George H W Bush, following the outbreak of civil war in the country, and has been renewed since then by both Democratic and Republican presidents. The Biden administration had renewed TPS for Somalia for the maximum 18 months allowed under the law, which are set to end in March. Over the last year, the Trump administration has moved to end TPS for immigrants from other countries previously deemed unsafe, including Venezuela, Haiti, Afghanistan, and Nepal. Those attempts have been challenged int he courts and in September a federal judge ruled that a move to end TPS for Haitians and Venezuelans was unlawful.

**Excerpt**

BTS stand to make $1bn as they announce mammoth comeback tour K-pop idols BTS have announced a globe-spanning, 79-date world tour, marking their return to the stage after a four-year hiatus. With dates in London, Tokyo, Munich, Sydney and Los Angeles, it's likely to be one of the biggest tours of the year, especially as the band haven't played outside the US and South Korea since 2019. Their previous tour set records for a K-pop act - earning about $246m (£182m) at the global box office. Along the way, BTS became the first Korean act to headline Wembley Stadium. The band's latest trek around the planet will kick off with three nights in South Korea's Goyang Stadium on 9 April 2026, before setting off across Asia, Europe and America. The show will see the band performing on a 360-degree, in-the-round stage, allowing for more seats to be made available at every venue. It will hit London for two nights at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on 6 and 7 July. The European leg also includes dates in Paris, Madrid, Brussels and Munich. A message on the band's website said further dates would be announced in Japan, the Middle East "and more" for 2027. (See the bottom of this page for a full list of the dates so far.) Tickets will be available to fans from 22 January, and the general public two days later. According to Billboard, the group and their record label BigHit / Hybe stand to make more than $1bn (£740m) from their reunion - derived from concerts, merchandise, licensing, album sales and streaming revenue. During the band's hiatus in 2024, Hybe's operating profit dropped by almost 37.5%, which the company attributed partially to "BTS' temporary break". Formed in the early 2010s, BTS were at the forefront of popularising K-pop with mainstream audiences in the west, thanks to their energetic blend of slick dance pop and hip-hop, and surprisingly introspective lyrics. Excitement has been mounting for their comeback ever since rapper and songwriter Suga completed his 18-month mandatory military service last June. He was the last of the septet to return to civilian life, following his bandmates Jin, J-Hope, V, RM, Jung Kook and Jimin. When the band announced plans for a comeback in a live broadcast on the fan platform Weverse last July, more than seven million people tuned in to watch. Figures like that indicate there will be a scramble for concert tickets similar to the sale for Taylor Swift's Eras Tour in 2022, and Oasis's reunion tour in 2024. For many BTS fans, it will be their first chance to see the band perform live in seven years. In that time, the group scored their first US number one single with Dynamite, a fleet-footed pop song that also became their first top 10 hit in the UK. They followed it up with the throwback disco-funk of Butter, inspired by Michael Jackson; and a smash collaboration with Coldplay, My Universe. However, a world tour planned for 2020 had to be cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic. After restrictions on live music lifted, they only managed a handful of dates before starting military service. Their streaming numbers have declined during the hiatus - but various solo projects have kept hardcore fans invested. When the band cleared their social media profiles and revealed the release date for their new album on New Year's Day, Weverse was so overwhelmed by fans logging on for information that the platform crashed. The album, which has yet to receive a title, was recorded in Los Angeles over six months last year and will hit streaming services on 20 March. Band leader RM updated fans on the progress last August, saying the band were "working diligently", but admitting it had been "weird" to adjust to life outside the military. "I live, work, and play with the members. It's a really strange experience," he said. "Making something 'together' with these friends, I'm going to commit myself to this moment... I'm looking for what I'll become." J-Hope had previously said the band's various solo projects would inform the new music. "I think that over time, we each refined our unique identities as each of us work on their own music," he told Apple Music's Zane Lowe. "I'm curious to see how it'll look like... I think it's going to be a massive energy." Updating fans in December, RM said "the album is almost here. It really is on its way." "We practiced together yesterday, too," he added. "We are filming and practicing every day." BTS sent handwritten letters to their fandom - known collectively as ARMY - ahead of announcing the new album. Delivered directly to fans' homes, the notes expressed gratitude and excitement about their reunion. "The year we've been waiting for has finally arrived," wrote Jimin. "We've waited more earnestly than anyone else," added RM. Youngest member Jung Kook (who arguably had the most successful solo career during BTS's hiatus) struck a tone of humility. "My heart has always been the same," he wrote. "I'll keep doing my best, just as I always have." And V concluded with a message to fans: "In 2026, we'll make even more good memories, so look forward to it!"

**Excerpt**

Le Pen blames European Parliament in appeal that could decide political fate French far-right leader Marine Le Pen has told a Paris court she hopes will overturn her conviction for embezzling EU funds that she had "no sense of having committed an offence". Le Pen, 57, was found guilty last year for hiring assistants who worked on her National Rally party's affairs rather than for the European Parliament (EP) that paid them. "The EP did not play its role of raising the alarm as it should have," she told judges at the start of an appeal trial against a conviction banning her from running for public office for five years. If the ban is upheld, she will not be able to stand in the 2027 presidential election. The case at the Paris Court of Appeal will last until 12 February but a ruling is not expected before the summer. Last year's case centred on charges that Le Pen, along with more than 20 other senior party figures, used European Parliament funding to pay for National Rally staff in France. Le Pen was given a four-year prison sentence – with two years suspended and the remaining two to be served with an electronic tag rather than in custody. She was handed a €100,000 (£82,635) fine and banned from seeking public office "with immediate effect". More than 20 RN figures were also found guilty in last year's trial and the party was ordered to pay a €2m fine, with half the amount suspended. Eleven of Le Pen's colleagues are taking part in the Paris appeal, but 12 have decided not to challenge the original verdicts, including her sister Yann Le Pen who was given a one-year suspended prison term. With Le Pen standing, presiding judge Michèle Agi started the hearing by reading the charges and last-year's verdict. The RN leader then returned to her seat, in the company of some of the other co-defendants and her lawyers. Judge Agi then read a report summarising facts of the case, after which Le Pen and her co-defendants took the floor. "We have never concealed anything, neither in the publication of our organisational charts, nor in the contracts filed, nor in the numerous press articles," the RN leader said. Under the French legal system, an appeals court reviews the decision of the lower, first-instance court in its entirety - including facts as well as points of law. Le Pen will be hoping the Paris appeals court overturns last year's verdict and clears her name and path to run for the highest office in France for the fourth time. A second possible outcome would be for the appeals panel to affirm the guilty verdict but remove the "immediate effect" clause. This would enable her to run even if she decided to appeal to the country's highest court – the Court of Cassation – to overturn the guilty verdict. A third outcome could see the appeals judges curtail the five-year ban sufficiently to enable Le Pen to register by the March 2027 deadline. And a fourth would be to leave the lower court's decisions intact. This would make it next to impossible to run – even though she would still be expected to take the case to the Court of Cassation. The fifth - which would definitely rule Le Pen out of the race - would be for the original conviction to be upheld and the sentence to be stiffened. After all, the offence may be punishable with up to 10 years in jail. With the presidential election expected to be held around April 2027, much will depend on the substance – as well as the timing – of the judgements. The far-right leader has twice made it to the run-off stage and many of her supporters think she has a chance of winning if she is cleared to run next year. On Monday, the president of her National Rally party, Jordan Bardella, said barring her from the election would be "deeply worrying for democracy". Bardella said he would not stand for president but would instead seek the lower-ranking post of prime minister. An opinion poll - published by Le Monde newspaper on the eve of the appeal - suggested Bardella may have a better chance of winning the French presidency - 49% against 18% for Le Pen.

### 9. [Cold weather and data centres drive up US greenhouse gas emissions](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj9r3832j47o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

Cold weather and data centres drive up US greenhouse gas emissions A very cold start to 2025 and the growing power demands of data centres and cryptocurrencies saw US emissions of planet-warming gases rise for the first time in three years, a new analysis shows. Last year homes burned more gas for heating while the use of coal surged by 13% to meet rising electricity demands, the data finds. Although solar power also shot up last year, overall, greenhouse gas emissions went up by 2.4% after two years of decreases, outpacing the level of economic growth, according to estimates from the Rhodium Group. The authors say the policies of the Trump administration didn't "meaningfully impact" the rise in emissions but they expect this to change in the coming years. In the colder parts of the United States, most homes rely on natural gas and other fossil fuels for their heating. The low temperatures experienced in early 2025 saw consumption of these fuels increase by nearly 7% compared with the previous year. Extra electric power was also needed by the boom in data centres and cryptocurrency mining operations in places like Texas and the Ohio Valley region. The rising demand for power combined with the higher cost of gas was behind the 13% surge in US coal use last year. That was in marked contrast to both India and China, where coal use for electricity dropped 3% and 1.6% respectively as both countries added record amounts of wind and solar energy, according to an analysis for the website, Carbon Brief. "The grid decided to meet that additional load this year, in part with renewables, in part with fossil but because of higher natural gas prices, there was some fuel switching that saw marginally more coal than there was in 2024," said Michael Gaffney, from Rhodium Group, the report's lead author. Other observers see the high price of gas in the US as closely related to continuing large exports of gas to the rest of the world. "Higher natural gas prices means that finally, coal, which had been kind of driven to extinction by low natural gas prices, well [gas is] now so expensive that coal's worthwhile again," said Jesse Lee, from Climate Power, a US-based environmental campaign group. "And that's what is allowing coal to make this comeback." Since 2007 coal power generation in the US has shrunk by 64%, with last year's rise only the second in the last decade. Last year also saw a slowdown in the rate of coal plant retirements, as electricity companies delayed closures to meet demands. So is 2025 the start of the revival of coal? "It's more than just a blip," said Michael Gaffney. "This is a response to the demand growth in the sector, a lot of it is coming from data centres, cryptocurrency operations, other large load customers, and that demand growth is here to stay." Solar power also experienced a major growth spurt in the US last year, rising by 34%, the fastest rate since 2017. Transport in the US, by road, rail and air remains the largest source of warming gases, with road traffic volumes increasing for the fifth year in a row. However, emissions from this sector were virtually flat in 2025 due to increasing numbers of hybrid and electric vehicles on the roads. Hybrids, in particular, showed strong growth, up 25% compared to 2024. While President Trump has been forceful in his determination to rollback the climate-related policies of his predecessor, and to boost US extraction of fossil fuel, Rhodium analysts who carried out this report say those changes made little difference in 2025. Some others disagree. "There is a data centre explosion, that is somewhat independent of Trump," says Lee, of Climate Power. "You could argue maybe his policies haven't all kicked in full blast yet, but I don't think you can really divorce his natural gas exports and his blind support of AI and data centres from this dynamic that's driving up emissions."

**Excerpt**

'They just kept killing': Eyewitnesses describe deadly crackdown in Iran "I saw it with my own eyes - they fired directly into lines of protesters, and people fell where they stood." Omid's voice was shaking as he spoke, fearful of being traced. Breaking the wall of silence between Iran and the rest of the world takes immense courage, given the risk of reprisals by the authorities. Omid, in his early 40s and whose name we have changed for his safety, has been protesting on the streets of a small city in southern Iran over the past few days against worsening economic hardship. He said security forces had opened fire at unarmed protesters in his city with Kalashnikov-style assault rifles. "We are fighting a brutal regime with empty hands," he said. The BBC has received similar accounts of the crackdown by security forces following the widespread protests across the country last week. Since then, internet access has been cut by the authorities, making reporting from Iran more difficult than ever. BBC Persian is banned from reporting inside Iran by the government. One of the largest nationwide anti-government protests took place on Thursday, the twelfth night of demonstrations. Many people appear to have joined the protests on Thursday and Friday after calls from Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the last shah of Iran who was overthrown in the 1979 Islamic revolution. The following day, Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei said: "The Islamic Republic will not back down." It appears that the worst bloodshed occurred after that warning as security forces and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps take their orders from him. Iranian authorities accused the US and Israel of fomenting trouble and condemned "terrorist actions", state media reported. A young woman from Tehran said last Thursday felt like "the day of judgement". "Even remote neighbourhoods of Tehran were packed with protesters - places you wouldn't believe," she said. "But on Friday, security forces only killed and killed and killed. Seeing it with my own eyes made me so unwell that I completely lost morale. Friday was a bloody day." She said that, after Friday's killings, people were afraid to go out and that many were now chanting from alleys and inside their homes. Tehran was a battlefield, she said, with protesters and security forces taking positions and cover on the streets. But she added: "In war, both sides have weapons. Here, people only chant and get killed. It is a one-sided war." Eyewitnesses in Fardis, a city just to the west of Tehran, said that on Friday, members of the paramilitary Basij force under the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) suddenly attacked protesters after hours without a police presence on the streets. The forces, who were in uniform and riding motorcycles, fired live ammunition directly at protesters, according to the witnesses. Unmarked cars were also driven into alleys, with occupants shooting at residents who were not involved in the protests, they said. "Two or three people were killed in every alley," one witness alleged. Those who have given accounts to BBC Persian say the reality inside Iran is hard for the outside world to imagine, and the death toll reported by international media so far only represents a fraction of their own estimates. International news outlets are not allowed to work freely inside Iran and they are mostly relying on Iranian human rights groups who are active outside the country. On Monday the Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHRNGO) said at least 648 protesters in Iran had been killed, including nine people under the age of 18. Some local sources and eyewitnesses report very high numbers of people killed across different cities, ranging from several hundreds to thousands. The BBC is currently unable to independently verify these figures and, so far, Iranian authorities have not provided official or transparent statistics on the number of deaths of protesters. However, Iranian media has reported that 100 security personnel had been killed during the protests, saying that protesters - whom they refer to as "rioters" - set fire to dozens of mosques and banks in various cities. Videos verified by BBC Persian's fact-checking team also show police vehicles and some government buildings being set alight in different locations during the protests. Testimonies and video sent to BBC Persian are mainly from larger cities such as Tehran, nearby Karaj, Rasht in the north, Mashhad in the north-east, and Shiraz in the south. These areas have greater access to the internet via the Starlink satellite network. Information from small towns - where many early casualties occurred - is scarce as their access to Starlink is very limited. But the volume, consistency, and similarity of the accounts received from various cities point to the severity of the crackdown and the widespread use of lethal violence. Nurses and medics who spoke to the BBC said they had seen numerous dead bodies and injured protesters. They reported that hospitals in many cities had been overwhelmed and were unable to treat those with severe injuries, especially to the head and eyes. Some witnesses reported bodies "stacked on top of each other" and not handed over to families. Graphic videos published on the activist-run Telegram channel Vahid Online on Sunday showed a large number of bodies at the Kahrizak Forensic Medical Centre in Tehran, with many families either mourning or attempting to identify the corpses. In one of the videos apparently from Kahrizak, relatives are seen looking at the photos of unidentified bodies displayed on a screen. Many bodies in black bags were visible in the facility and on the street outside, only some of which seem to have been identified. One video showed the inside of a warehouse containing several bodies, while another showed a truck being unloaded with people removing corpses from it. A mortuary worker in a cemetery in Mashhad said that before sunrise on Friday morning between 180 and 200 bodies with severe head injuries were brought in and buried immediately. A source in Rasht told BBC Persian that 70 bodies of protesters were transferred to a hospital mortuary in the city on Thursday. According to the source, security forces demanded "payment for bullets" before releasing bodies to families. At the same time, a medical staff member at a hospital in eastern Tehran told BBC Persian that on Thursday, around 40 bodies were brought there the same day. The hospital's name has been withheld to protect the identity of the medic. UN Secretary-General António Guterres said on Sunday that he was "shocked by reports of violence and excessive use of force by the Iranian authorities against protesters resulting in deaths and injuries in recent days". "I want to emphasise that regardless of the death toll, the use of lethal force by security forces is concerning," Mai Sato, the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran, told BBC Persian.
