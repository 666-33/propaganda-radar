How Australian festival imploded after axing Palestinian author One of Australia's biggest cultural festivals has been left in disarray after a decision to disinvite a prominent Australian-Palestinian writer, triggering a massive backlash and mass exodus from fellow authors. The board of the Adelaide Festival last week said Dr Randa Abdel-Fattah, a vocal critic of Israel, had been removed from its Writers' Week lineup due to "sensitivities" after the shooting of 15 people – by gunmen allegedly inspired by the Islamic State militant group – at a Jewish festival at Bondi Beach in December. Though the Adelaide Festival's board said they "do not suggest in any way" that Abdel-Fattah had "any connection with the tragedy at Bondi", they made the decision that it would not be "culturally sensitive" to include her "given her past statements". She called the decision to exclude her a "blatant and shameless act of anti-Palestinian racism and censorship" and the attempt to link her with the Bondi attack "despicable". In the following days, dozens of other writers scheduled to appear withdrew from the festival. By Tuesday the list had jumped to 180, including former New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, British author Zadie Smith, US-Russian journalist Masha Gessen, beloved Australian writer Helen Garner and British-Australian novelist Kathy Lette. Many publicly criticised the decision as an attack on free speech. Four members of the eight-member board, including the chair, have now resigned without detailing their reasons. And on Tuesday the director of the Writers' Week - who had invited Abdel-Fattah - stood down too. Louise Adler, the Jewish daughter of Holocaust survivors, said "I cannot be party to silencing writers" and that Abdel-Fattah's exclusion "weakens freedom of speech and is the harbinger of a less free nation." "Artists have always been a problem for the state and interest groups but the confrontations have intensified as a consequence of the war on Gaza," she wrote in the Guardian Australia. "Writers and writing matters, even when they are presenting ideas that discomfort and challenge us." The saga has threatened to spawn legal action and potentially halt the entire festival, which also features music, dance, theatre and other cultural events and is scheduled to begin at the end of February. Why has Randa Abdel-Fattah been criticised? Abdel-Fattah, a novelist, lawyer and academic, had been invited to the festival to discuss her latest novel Discipline – which she describes as "a cautionary tale about the cost of silence and cowardice". She has previously been criticised for statements arguing that Zionists had "no claim or right to cultural safety" and a 2024 post on X in which she said "the goal is decolonisation and the end of this murderous Zionist colony", a reference to Israel. Controversies around her also include an image posted to her social media in the hours after the 7 October 2023 attack by Hamas on Israel, depicting a person parachuting with a Palestinian flag. Hamas fighters used paragliders to cross the high-tech security fence into Israel at the start of the attack, landing in civilian areas where many residents died. About 1,200 people were killed in the attack. It triggered a massive Israeli military offensive on Gaza, which has killed more than 71,419 people since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Abdel-Fattah confirmed to Australian broadcaster ABC that she had posted the image, but said she had done so before the true extent of the attacks was known. "At that point, I had no idea about the death toll, I had no idea about what was happening on the ground... Of course, I do not support the killing of civilians," she told the ABC. The academic has been the target of public campaigns before. Opposition politicians and some prominent Jewish Australians called for research funding awarded to Abdel-Fattah to be cancelled in 2024. After a letter from Education Minister Jason Clare, the funding was suspended while Abdel-Fattah was investigated over allegations she had bent the grant's rules, though she was ultimately cleared last month. Norman Schueler, of the Jewish Community Council for South Australia, last week said his organisation had sent a letter to the Adelaide Festival board lobbying for Abdel-Fattah's removal. "It was a very wise move and it will improve the cohesiveness of the festival by not having her there," he told the Adelaide Advertiser after her removal. Upon news of the growing walkout, he added: "I think for everyone who has dropped out that it's rather pathetic because that means they agree with what Dr Fattah is on about... Namely, that Israel should not exist." South Australian Premier Peter Malinauskus - whose government is a key backer of the festival - said that he "wholeheartedly" supported Abdel-Fattah's exclusion and had "absolutely made clear to the board that I did not think it was wise" to invite her. However, Malinauskus denied having played any role in the board's decision, telling the ABC on Monday that, though he shared his opinion, he had not threatened to withdraw funding or sack anyone. He also denied that his position was influenced by Jewish lobby groups. Adler said the board's decision had been taken "despite my strongest opposition" and added: "In my view, boards composed of individuals with little experience in the arts, and blind to the moral implications of abandoning the principle of freedom of expression, have been unnerved by the pressure exerted by politicians calculating their electoral prospects and relentless, coordinated letter-writing campaigns." "The board's statement cites community cohesion, an oft-referenced anxiety which should be treated with scepticism," she said. "One doesn't have to be a student of history to know that art in the service of 'social cohesion' is propaganda." After her appearance was cancelled, Abdel-Fattah said Australian arts and cultural institutions had displayed "utter contempt and inhumanity towards Palestinians". "The only Palestinians they will tolerate are silent and invisible ones." It isn't the first time Abdel-Fattah has been at the centre of the derailment of a writers' festival. Two days before it was due to begin in August last year, Bendigo Writers Festival issued a code of conduct requiring speakers to "avoid language or topics that could be considered inflammatory, divisive, or disrespectful". A subsequent walkout - led by Abdel-Fattah and others over concerns it could prevent free discussion of the Israel-Gaza war - led to the cancellation of around a third of the programme. Allegations of hypocrisy However Abdel-Fattah has been accused of double standards, by sections of the media and Malinauskus, who claim that she had successfully demanded the exclusion of New York Times journalist Thomas Friedman from the Adelaide festival two years ago. A letter sent by her and nine other academics to the board followed his publication of a column in which he compared players in the Middle East to members of the animal kingdom, including caterpillars, wasps and spiders. "Call it what you like, after the correspondence from Dr Randa Abdel-Fattah, they removed a pro-Jewish Israeli speaker. Fast forward two years and I think it's reasonable for the board to apply the same principle," Malinauskus said. Abdel-Fattah rejected the allegations of hypocrisy, saying in a statement to the BBC that Friedman's article had "compared various Arab and Muslim nations and groups to insects and vermin requiring eradication at a time when talk of 'human animals' was being used to justify wholesale slaughter in Gaza". "In contrast, I was cancelled because my presence and identity as a Palestinian was deemed 'culturally insensitive' and linked to the Bondi atrocity," her statement continued. She also denied that Friedman had been removed at her behest. In a letter dated February 2024 and quoted by Australian media, the board wrote that cancelling a writer was an "extremely serious request" and that while Friedman had been scheduled to attend he would no longer take part due to "last-minute scheduling issues". "If he was in fact quietly cancelled, it only underscores the racism of cancelling me in such a brazen and publicly humiliating manner," Abdel-Fattah said. The BBC has contacted Friedman for comment. What have other writers said? Adler says at least 180 writers have now said they will no longer take part in the festival, devastating its programme. Some said that while they did not necessarily agree with Abdel-Fattah, they defended her right to free speech. Australian journalist Peter Greste, who was jailed in Egypt a decade ago in what human rights groups called a sham case, wrote in an opinion piece for the Guardian Australia that her exclusion meant "we are undermining our capacity to hold those difficult conversations" and "doing the work" of extremists for them. Kathy Lette in an Instagram post argued that audiences should be trusted to "make up their minds about all speakers – me included. As authoritarianism rears its hideous head around the world, we need to defend these havens of free speech." However, former Australian foreign minister Bob Carr, who has strongly criticised Israel's assault on Gaza, said he supported Abdel-Fattah's exclusion. He told the Guardian Australia he believed some of her previous statements had been counterproductive to the Palestinian cause and that given the circumstances after the Bondi attack the decision was not unreasonable. "The Adelaide writers' festival has supported hearing Palestinian voices, its record on this is unimpeachable," Carr said. He was one of the only festival speakers to publicly back the board. Former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis posted a video on X in which he tore us his "precious" and "coveted" invitation to speak, claiming the festival had been "destroyed" by the "Zionist lobby". Award-winning First Nations poet Evelyn Araluen said she was "so disappointed to witness yet another absurd and irrational capitulation to the demands of a genocidal foreign state from the Australian arts sector". "Erasing Palestinians from public life in Australia won't prevent antisemitism," she added. ABC journalist and presenter Sarah Ferguson, who had been due to host conversations with Tina Brown and Jacinda Ardern – both now cancelled – said the festival had "created a place where debate flourished… including on our most difficult subjects" and that it "should be defended in our cultural life". What happens next? Abdel-Fattah's lawyer, Michael Bradley, has sent a letter to the board demanding to know which of her past statements were used to justify last week's decision. "The moral indefensibility of the Adelaide Festival board's actions has been amply evidenced by the reaction it's provoked. It also trampled on Randa's human rights, and the board will have to answer for that," Bradley told the BBC on Monday, adding that Abdel-Fattah had yet to decide whether to take any legal action. Abdel-Fattah had last week asked for an apology and to be reinstated but on Monday she told the ABC she believed the event had gone "beyond the point of no return". Julian Hobbe, the festival's executive director, said that after the "significant community response" to the board's decision, it was "navigating a complex and unprecedented moment and will share further updates as soon as we are able".

Trump announces 25% tariff on countries doing business with Iran US President Donald Trump on Monday said he had imposed a 25% tariff on goods from countries with commercial ties to Iran, a move that could put pressure on Tehran as anti-government protests enter a third week. Trump said on social media that the tariff was "effective immediately", without offering details of what constituted "doing business" with Iran. China is Iran's largest trading partners, followed by Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey and India. The new tariff comes after Trump threatened to intervene militarily if Tehran killed protesters. White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said on Monday that military options including air strikes were still "on the table". "Any Country doing business with the Islamic Republic of Iran will pay a Tariff of 25% on any and all business being done with the United States of America," Trump wrote on Truth Social on Monday. "This Order is final and conclusive," he added. The White House did not share additional information about the tariffs, including which countries' imports will be hit hardest. Anger over the plummeting value of the Iranian currency, the rial, sparked protests in late December, which have grown into a crisis of legitimacy for Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The US-based Human Rights Activist News Agency (HRANA) says it has verified the deaths of nearly 500 protesters and 48 security personnel in Iran, while sources tell the BBC the death toll could be much higher. Thousands more have reportedly been arrested. However, an internet blackout since Thursday evening has made it difficult to obtain and verify information. The BBC and most other international news organisations are unable to report from inside Iran. Trump has threatened to intervene, and said on Sunday that Iranian officials had called him "to negotiate" - but added "we may have to act before a meeting". International sanctions over Iran's nuclear programme have had a severe impact on the country's economy, which has also been weakened by government mismanagement and corruption. On 28 December shopkeepers took to the streets of Tehran to express their anger at another sharp fall in the value of the rial against the US dollar on the open market. Iran's currency has sunk to a record low over the past year while inflation has soared to more than 40%, resulting in sharp price rises for everyday items like cooking oil and meat.

**Excerpt**

'We were tricked': How one woman lures foreign men to fight on Russia's front line Flames lick around the edges of Omar's passport. "It's burning well," an unseen woman says in Russian in the video. Omar, a 26-year-old Syrian construction worker, had been deployed for about nine months on the front line of Russia's war in Ukraine when the clip arrived on his phone. He knew the woman's voice. It was Polina Alexandrovna Azarnykh, who he says had helped him sign up to fight for Russia, promising lucrative work and Russian citizenship. But now she was angry. In a series of voice notes from Ukraine, Omar, speaking under a pseudonym for his safety, describes how he ended up trapped and terrified in the war zone. He says Azarnykh had promised that if he paid her $3,000 (£2,227), she would ensure he stayed in a non-combat role. But, he says, he was sent into battle with just 10 days of training, so he refused to pay and she eventually responded by burning his passport. He says he tried refusing to take part in a mission, but his commanders threatened to kill or jail him. "We were tricked… this woman is a con artist and a liar," says Omar. A BBC Eye investigation has followed how Azarnykh, a 40-year-old former teacher, uses a Telegram channel to lure young men, often from poor countries, into joining Russia's military. The former teacher's smiling video messages and upbeat posts offer "one-year contracts" for "military service". The BBC World Service has identified nearly 500 cases where she has provided documents, referred to as invitations, which allow the recipient to enter Russia to join the military. These have been for men - mainly from Syria, Egypt and Yemen - who appear to have sent her their passport details in order to enlist. But recruits and their relatives have told the BBC that she misled men into believing they would avoid combat, failed to make clear they could not leave after a year and threatened those who challenged her. When contacted by the BBC, she rejected the allegations. Twelve families told us of young men they say were recruited by her who are now dead or missing. Domestically, Russia has expanded conscription, recruited prisoners and offered increasingly generous sign-up bonuses to maintain its operation in Ukraine, despite substantial losses. More than one million of its soldiers have been killed or wounded since the full-scale invasion in 2022, with 25,000 killed in the month of December 2025 alone, according to Nato. Research by BBC News Russian, based on obituaries and other publicly available death records, suggests Russian troop losses in Ukraine rose faster than ever last year. It is difficult to determine how many foreigners have joined Russia's military. BBC Russian's analysis - which also looked at the number of foreigners killed and injured - suggests at least 20,000 may have signed up, including from countries such as Cuba, Nepal and North Korea. Ukraine has suffered significant troop losses too, and has also taken foreign fighters into its ranks. 'Bodies everywhere' Omar's first contact with Azarnykh was when he was stranded with barely any money at a Moscow airport in March 2024, together with 14 other Syrians. Jobs in Syria were scarce and low paid. Omar says a recruiter there had offered the men what they understood to be civilian work guarding oil facilities in Russia. They flew to Moscow, only to learn they had been scammed. Searching online for options, Omar says, one of the group found Azarnykh's channel and messaged her. She met them at the airport within hours, and took them by train to a recruitment centre in Bryansk, western Russia, he says. There, he says, she offered them one-year contracts with the Russian army, with a monthly salary equivalent to about $2,500 (£1,856), and a sign-up payment of $5,000 (£3,711) - sums they could only dream of in Syria. Omar says the contracts were in Russian, which none of the men understood, and she took their passports, promising to arrange Russian citizenship. She also promised they could avoid combat roles if they paid her $3,000 (£2,227) each from their sign-up payments, he says. But, he says, within about a month, he was on the front line with, he says, just 10 days' training and no military experience. "We're 100% going to die here," he says in one of his voice notes, sent to the BBC investigative team. "A lot of injuries, a lot of explosions, a lot of shelling. If you don't die from the explosion, you'll die from the debris landing on you," he says in May 2024. "Dead bodies everywhere… I've stepped on dead bodies, God forgive me," he reports the following month. "If someone dies, I've seen it with my own eyes, they put him in a rubbish bag and throw him next to a tree," he adds. After nearly a year, he had discovered what he says Azarnykh had failed to explain - a 2022 Russian decree essentially allows the military to extend soldiers' contracts automatically until the war ends. "If they renew the contract, I'm screwed - oh God," he says. His contract was continued. 'Recruited from university' Azarnykh's Telegram channel has 21,000 subscribers. Her posts have often told readers wanting to apply to join the Russian military to send her a scan of their passport. She has then posted invitation documents, sometimes with a list of names of the men they are for. The BBC has identified more than 490 such invitations that she has sent over the past year to men from countries including Yemen, Syria, Egypt, Morocco, Iraq, Ivory Coast and Nigeria. Her posts have mentioned recruitment for an "elite international battalion" and made it clear that people in Russia illegally - including those whose visas have expired - are eligible. Outside the UK, watch the film on YouTube. We have spoken to eight foreign fighters including Omar who were recruited by her, as well as the families of the 12 men who are missing or dead. Many felt Azarnykh had misled or exploited recruits. They told us the men knew they were joining the military, but did not expect to serve on the front line. Several, like Omar, felt they had inadequate training or thought they would be able to leave after a year. In Egypt, Yousef - whose name we have also changed - told the BBC his older brother Mohammed, began a university course in Yekaterinburg in Russia in 2022. But he struggled to pay his fees, Yousef says, and told his family a Russian woman named Polina had begun offering him help online, including work with the Russian military that he believed would allow him to continue his studies. "She promised him housing and citizenship… monthly expenses," he says. "Suddenly he was sent to Ukraine. He found himself fighting," says Yousef. His last call was on 24 January 2024, Yousef says. About a year later, Yousef says a message arrived on Telegram from a Russian number, containing images of Mohammed's body. The family eventually learned he had been killed almost a year earlier. 'Some lost their minds' Azarnykh became "one of the most important recruiters" for Russia's army, says Habib, another Syrian who has served in Russia's military. He was willing to be filmed but spoke under a pseudonym for fear of repercussions. Habib says he and Azarnykh "worked together for around three years on visa invitations to Russia". He gave no further details and we have not been able to confirm his role in the process. An image from social media in 2024 shows him alongside her. Azarnykh, who is from Russia's south-western Voronezh region, ran a Facebook group helping Arab students come to Moscow to study, before starting her Telegram channel in 2024. Habib says most foreign recruits arrived expecting roles securing facilities or standing at checkpoints. "The Arabs who are coming are dying immediately. Some people lost their minds - it's hard to see dead bodies," he says. Habib says he met Omar and the group of Syrians at a military training site. "She had promised them citizenship, good salaries and that they'd be safe," Habib says. "But once you sign a contract here, there's no way you can leave." "None of them knew how to use a weapon. Even if they were shot at, they would choose not to shoot back… if you don't shoot, you will be killed," he says. "Polina would take the men, knowing that they were going to die." He says she "received $300 (£223) from the army for every person she recruited". The BBC could not confirm this, although other recruits also told us they believed she received payment. 'Nothing happens for free' Azarnykh's posts from mid-2024 begin to note that recruits will be "participating in hostilities" and mention foreign fighters who have died in combat. "You all understood well that you were going to war," she says in one video in October 2024. "You thought that you could get a Russian passport, do nothing and live in a five-star hotel?... Nothing happens for free." In another case, in 2024, the BBC has heard a voice message sent by Azarnykh to a mother whose son was serving in the military. Azarnykh says the woman has "published something horrible about the Russian army". Using expletives, she threatens the son's life and warns the woman: "I'll find you and all your children." The BBC made multiple attempts to contact Azarnykh. Initially she said she would do an interview with us if we travelled to Russia, but the BBC declined for safety reasons. Later, when asked in a voice call about claims that recruits were promised non-combat roles, she hung up. In voice notes sent afterwards, she said our work was "not professional" and warned of potential defamation proceedings. She also said: "Our respected Arabs can stick their accusations up their arses." The BBC contacted the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Defence for comment, but received no response. Previously, in March 2022 President Putin backed the recruitment of men from the Middle East, insisting they were ideologically, not financially, driven: "There are people who want to come voluntarily, especially not for money, and provide assistance to people." 'Cash incentives' Journalists and researchers following the issue say individuals like Azarnykh are part of a web of informal recruiters. The BBC has found two other Telegram accounts in Arabic making similar offers for joining Russia's military. One includes posts showing invitation documents and lists of names, the other has advertised large sign-up payments for joining an "elite battalion". In September, Kenyan police said they had broken up a suspected "trafficking syndicate" that they said was luring Kenyans with job offers, but sending them to fight in Ukraine. Kateryna Stepanenko, a research fellow at the Institute for the Study of War, told the BBC some municipal and regional authorities in Russia have been offering cash incentives of up to $4,000 (£2,970) to individuals such as HR professionals and local residents who recruit Russians or foreigners into military service. She says the Kremlin initially used larger entities such as the Wagner private military group and prison system for recruitment, but since 2024 has also been "leveraging locals and smaller companies". This "suggests to me that those earlier versions of recruitment are no longer generating the same number of recruits", she adds. Meanwhile, Habib is now back in Syria after, he says, having bribed several commanders to terminate his contract. Omar eventually received Russian citizenship and has also managed to return to Syria. Two of the Syrians he served with are dead, according to their families. Azarnykh "sees us as numbers or money - she doesn't see us as people", he says. "We won't forgive her for what she did to us."

**Excerpt**

Lyse Doucet: Iran's rulers face biggest challenge since 1979 revolution Iran's rulers are confronting their most serious challenge since their own 1979 revolution. They're now countering on an unprecedented scale - a ferocious security crackdown and near total internet shutdown has been unleashed on a scale unseen in previous crises. Some of the streets once engulfed by a roar of anger against the regime are now starting to go silent. "On Friday it was extremely crowded - the crowd was unbelievable - and there was a lot of shooting. Then Saturday night it became much, much quieter," a resident of Tehran told BBC Persian. "You would have to have a death wish to go out now," one Iranian journalist reflected. This time, an internal upheaval is also compounded by an external threat, with President Trump's repeated warnings of military action coming seven months after the US carried out strikes on key nuclear facilities during a 12-day war between Iran and Israel, which left the regime weakened. But, to use an analogy often used by the American leader, that has also given Iran "another card" to play. Trump now says Tehran has called to go back to the negotiating table. But Iran doesn't have a good hand: President Trump says he may still have to take some kind of action before any meeting; talks won't take all the searing heat out of this unrest. And Iran won't capitulate to what have been the US's maximalist demands, including zero nuclear enrichment, which would cross red lines which lie at the very heart of this theocracy's strategic doctrine. Whatever the pressure of this moment, there's no sign Iran's leaders are changing course. "Their inclination is to clamp down, to try to survive this moment, and then to figure out where they go from here," says Vali Nasr from the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, author of the book Iran's Grand Strategy. "But given their straits with the US, with Israel, with sanctions, even if they quell these protests, they don't have many options to improve the lives of Iranians." This week may decide the momentum in this moment - whether Iran, and the wider region, is plunged into another bout of military attacks; whether brute force has completely put down these protests – as it has in the past. Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told diplomats in Tehran today that "the situation is now under total control". Outside, in the bright light of day, the streets of Tehran were filled with the crowds the government called on to come out and reclaim the streets from protesters. Five days into a comprehensive communications blackout, a more chilling picture still sneaks out into the world through Starlink satellite terminals, Iranian technical creativity, and courage. Doctors' accounts of hospitals overwhelmed by casualties, grim videos of open-air mortuaries dotted by long lines of black body bags, voice notes sent to journalists at the BBC Persian Service expressing shock and fear. The numbers rise. In the last wave of unrest in 2022 and 2023, which lasted more than six months, around 500 deaths were recorded by human rights groups and more than 20,000 arrests. This time, within a few weeks, reports say the death toll already climbs far higher and more than 20,000 have been taken in so far. The government doesn't deny the bloodshed; state TV is also airing images of makeshift mortuaries, even admitting some protestors have been killed. The streets of Iran have been on fire. Government buildings have been set alight as anger burned. They are symbols of the system, but attacks on public property are condemned by the government as the work of "terrorists and rioters. " Legal language has also hardened in this time - "vandals " will be charged with "waging war against God" and face the death penalty. The government puts the main blame on foreign enemies - code name for Israel and the US - for an internal upsurge. This time, their accusation is also fuelled by the clear extent of infiltration by Israel's Mossad security agency during their 12-day war last year. With every new eruption of unrest in Iran, the same questions are asked: how far and wide do these protests reach; who's taking to the streets and squares; how will the authorities respond? This latest wave has been unique in many ways. It began in a most ordinary way. On 28 December, traders selling imported electronic goods in Tehran were jolted by the sudden currency collapse; they shuttered their shops, went on strike, and urged others in the bazaar to follow suit. The government's initial response was quick and conciliatory. President Masoud Pezeshkian promised dialogue and acknowledged "legitimate demands" in in a country where inflation soars near 50%, and currency depreciations play havoc with people's hardscrabble lives. A new monthly allowance, amounting to about $7 (£5), was soon deposited in everyone's bank account to help ease the pain. But prices shot up further; the wave of unrest swelled. Less than three weeks later, Iranians were marching everywhere - from small deprived provincial towns to major cities, chanting for economic and political change. There are no quick and simple fixes now; it's the system. Iran is broken by years of crippling international sanctions, mismanagement and corruption, deep seated rage over restrictions on social freedoms, and agony over the cost of this prolonged standoff with the West. But, so far, the centre appears to be holding. "The most important element still missing from a full collapse is repressive forces deciding that they no longer benefit from, and are no longer willing to kill for, the regime," explains Karim Sadjadpour, a Senior Fellow at the Carnegie Endowment in Washington. Before this crisis erupted, the most powerful players in Iran's ruling circles were known to be bitterly divided on key issues: if and how to resume the ill-fated negotiations with the US over a new nuclear deal, as well as how to restore strategic deterrence after the blows to its military proxies and political partners during the Gaza war. But survival of the system, their system, matters above all else. Ultimate authority still rests with the ailing 86-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, but he's encircled by his most loyal defenders, among them the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), who now hold sway over the economy, politics and security of the Islamic Republic. President Trump's almost daily threats are known to have concentrated minds at the top. It has also provoked speculation far and wide over the impact of any outside intervention. Military action could bolster the protesters; it could also backfire. "The primary impact would be to shore up elite unity and suppress fractures within the regime at a moment of heightened vulnerability," says Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa programme at the London-based think tank Chatham House. One of the loudest Iranian voices calling on President Trump to intervene has been the exiled former crown prince Reza Pahlavi, whose father was overthrown as Iran's shah in the 1979 Islamic revolution. But his call, and his close ties to Israel, are controversial. Other voices, from Nobel peace laureate Narges Mohammadi - still imprisoned in Iran, to award-winning filmmaker Jafar Panahi, insist that change must be peaceful, and must come from within. In this current unrest, Pahlavi has shown his capacity to help galvanise and give shape to this uprising. His appeals at the start of last week for coordinated chanting appear to have drawn more people out into the bitter winter cold. It's impossible to know the depth of his support, and whether this profound yearning for change leads some to hold fast to a familiar symbol. Iran's pre-revolutionary flag, with its lion and sun, has been unfurled again. Pahlavi emphasises he's not trying to bring back the monarchy but to lead a democratic transition; but in the past he has not been a unifying figure in the divided Iranian diaspora. Fears of collapse and chaos, financial woes, and more, also weigh on the minds of Iranians including those who still back the ruling clerics. Reform not revolution is on some minds. History tells us that when fervour and force meet on the streets, change can come from above, or below. It is always unpredictable - and often perilous.

Death toll in Philippines landfill collapse rises to 11 The death toll in a collapsed landfill in the central Philippines has risen to 11, authorities said. The landslide occurred at the Binaliw landfill in Cebu City last week while more than 100 workers were on site, officials said. Rescuers have so far pulled 12 injured people out of the debris, but more than 20 people still remain missing. One local fire official had earlier told AFP that was unlikely for "people to still be alive" three days after "tons of debris collapsed over them". But "signs of life" were detected in the debris during a search on Monday, Cebu City Mayor Nestor Archival told GMA News in an interview, adding that officials remain in "rescue mode". The incident has sparked calls for investigation into the cause of the collapse, as well as a review of the country's waste management system. Environment authorities have since ordered Prime Integrated Waste Solutions, Inc., the landfill's operator, to suspend its activities at the site. The company would have to "submit a compliance plan within 90 days", the local Department of Environment and Natural Resources said in a statement on Monday. The department also said it would conduct an investigation into the cause of the collapse and hold to account the responsible parties. Lawmakers have called for reviews of the country's waste management system and working conditions of waste workers. "This should have never happened," Senator Imee Marcos, who has requested an investigation into the Binaliw landfill's operations, said on Monday. "We have seen similar tragedies before, yet the same dangers persist." "The lives lost in Cebu demand clear answers and real reforms." Bienvinido Ranido, who lives near the landfill and whose wife worked there, told Reuters that he saw people fleeing from the site last week, saying the "garbage exploded". "I quickly took my motorcycle and rushed to the landfill. When I got there, I saw the collapsed building and it was buried by the garbage. I just screamed," he said. Rescuers retrieved his wife's body the next day. The Binaliw landfill is located on a piece of land measuring 20 hectares (49 acres) - three hectares of which are used for the landfill, Cebu newspaper The Freeman reported, citing the landfill's operator. While authorities are still looking into the cause of the landslide, a preliminary report from the local Mines and Geosciences Bureau points to continuous rainfall in recent weeks, which made the rubbish heavier, as well as other engineering factors, local media reported. Landfills are common in major Philippine cities like Cebu, which is the trading centre and transportation gateway of the Visayas, the archipelago nation's central islands.

How will investigators determine if Minneapolis ICE shooting was justified? US investigators will face a host of thorny questions in determining whether the fatal shooting of a woman by a federal agent in Minneapolis last week was justified, as local and national officials recount drastically different accounts of an incident that sparked nationwide protests. Several videos have emerged showing US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent Jonathan Ross firing at and killing Renee Good, 37, while she was behind the wheel of her burgundy Honda in a residential neighbourhood of the northern city. President Donald Trump and his administration have described Good as a "domestic terrorist" who was trying to run over the ICE agent, while state officials have said Good, a mother of three, was trying to leave the scene. Former law enforcement officials told the BBC that a review of the incident could plausibly find the agent was justified in using deadly force because he believed Good was a threat. But they said Trump officials' strong public statements in support of Ross in the immediate aftermath of the shooting could complicate the investigation. "When you have that much command and influence of everyone saying (the shooting) is already justified before the facts are in... I think that's where you have problems," former FBI special agent Robert D'Amico said. Officials cite video footage Local and federal officials have both cited video footage of the incident to support their interpretations of the event. Multiple angles show ICE agents approaching a car in the middle of the street and asking the driver - Good - to get out. One of the agents then tugs at the driver's side door handle. As the vehicle begins to move forward, an agent stood in front of the car - Ross, who was also filming - points and shoots at Good. The car turns away from the officers and crashes on the side of the road. Local and state officials say the videos demonstrate that Good was not a threat as she was turning away from the agent. Federal officials, meanwhile, say the videos are evidence that Good was trying to drive her car into the officer and that his only choice was to use deadly force. But former law enforcement officials told the BBC that judgements from both sides of the argument should have been withheld until a full investigation had been completed. "This is a politically charged situation where people on both the left and on the right have come to their conclusions before the investigation even started," said Ken Gray, a former FBI agent and a professor at the University of New Haven's Criminal Justice Department. Justifying deadly force When analysing whether the ICE officer was justified in shooting Good, investigators will have to compare Ross's actions in the videos to the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) policy on the use of deadly force. Former law enforcement agents said a previous episode in which Ross was injured on duty - as well as the quick determinations he had to make about the threat level - will likely be seen by federal investigators as providing that official justification. Under DHS policy, agents are authorised to use deadly force if they believe they are at risk of death, imminent threat of death or grievous bodily harm, Gray said. A specific clause states that officers cannot fire at a moving vehicle unless someone in the car is threatening the officer or unless the vehicle is "operated in a manner that threatens to cause death or serious physical injury" and "no other objectively reasonable means of defence appear to exist, which includes moving out of the path of the vehicle". Under the policy, officers are allowed to shoot at a threatening person inside the vehicle, but they cannot try to stop the car by shooting it. Gray said Good may not have been purposely trying to run over the agent. "But from the point of view of the officer or agent, all he knows is that this car is about to hit him," he said. "If I were placed in the same situation, I think I would have shot." Federal officials conducting the review will also consider that, just months earlier, Ross was dragged by a car and injured after confronting someone else in a vehicle. The incident could have convinced him Good was a similar threat, law enforcement experts said. D'Amico said that even if officials determine Ross's first shot at Good was justified, it might be harder to justify the second and third rounds Ross appeared to fire after the vehicle pulled away from him. He added that it would have been easy to find justification to use deadly force during arrests made during his own career, such as when a suspect reached for an unspecified object. But that did not mean such force was always the best course of action. "I think they're going to find that (the shooting) was justified," said D'Amico. "But just because you can take the shot doesn't mean you should." Reconstructing the scene In their review process, federal agents will also examine evidence beyond the videos, including reconstructing the scene physically and digitally, said Christopher Piehota, former head of the FBI Science and Technology Programs. Witness accounts, background information about Ross and Good and details about what else was going on that morning will help them examine what Piehota called the "totality" of the circumstances. Minnesota officials have said the federal government has blocked them from participating in the investigation. And Governor Tim Walz has expressed concerns that a probe conducted only by federal officials could be biased. Local officials have said they will conduct their own review. The state is also suing the federal government over ICE's deployment there. A jurisdiction battle This case, which involves a federal officer, falls under the jurisdiction of the federal government, according to Gray. Still, D'Amico said it was unusual to see administration officials coming to conclusions about a shooting before all evidence had been collected. In the days after Good was killed, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Vice-President JD Vance and President Donald Trump all gave public statements saying the ICE officer was in the right to fire at Good. D'Amico said FBI agents will gather the facts of what happened, but cautioned that the final determination of the shooting's justification could be "adversely affected" by the politics surrounding it. "If you're on a shooting review board for the Department of Homeland Security and your secretary said it's justified, your president said it's justified and your vice-president said it's justified, how do you then look at the facts and say 'I don't think it's justified'?" D'Amico said.

**Excerpt**

Pioneering gay footballer Josh Cavallo accuses former club of homophobia Joshua Cavallo - the first man to come out as gay while playing top-tier football - has alleged he was pushed out of his former club due to "internal homophobia". Cavallo, who recently joined Stamford AFC after leaving Adelaide United in May last year, made global headlines in 2021 when he came out with the support of his Australian club and teammates. In an Instagram post on Tuesday, Cavallo alleged that the Adelaide United officials had afterwards sidelined him due to his sexuality, something a spokesperson for the club said it "categorically rejects". "All on-field decisions relating to team selection are made solely on footballing grounds," the club's statement read. In the Instagram post, Cavallo wrote that it had taken him a while to "digest how my time at Adelaide United ended" but said he was speaking out because fans deserve honesty. "It's hard to swallow when I realised my own club was homophobic. I was angry because people thought I was sidelined based on injuries, when in reality, it was internal homophobia that kept me on the bench." A change in management meant "politics" kept him off the pitch and limited his career opportunities, Cavallo said, also alleging a photo of him and his partner was mocked by his teammates in a group chat. "For the first time, I actually questioned if I should have kept my sexuality a secret." A spokesperson for Adelaide United - which is due to take part in its fourth Pride Cup match on Saturday - said it was "extremely disappointed by the claims made". "Adelaide United has always been committed to fostering an inclusive environment for players, staff and supporters, and we remain proud of our ongoing work to promote inclusion across football." Cavallo has previously spoken about receiving death threats on a near daily basis after his decision to publicly come out, but has said that his only regret is not coming out sooner. His 2021 revelation inspired Jake Daniels, who in 2022, at the age of 17, became the first British professional male footballer to come out in more than 30 years.

**Excerpt**

Chalamet beats DiCaprio to Golden Globes glory Timothée Chalamet was among the main winners as Hollywood's finest gathered for this year's Golden Globe Awards. Chalamet, 30, continued his pursuit of greatness, and an Oscar, by beating stars including Leonardo DiCaprio and George Clooney to the award for best actor in a musical or comedy for table tennis caper Marty Supreme. Despite DiCaprio missing out, his film One Battle After Another won the most awards overall, with four prizes including best musical or comedy film and best director. Irish actress Jessie Buckley was named best drama actress for Hamnet, which also scored a surprise win in the best drama film category. Vampire thriller Sinners had been considered the frontrunner, but it instead went home with the box office achievement prize as well as best score. The Golden Globes are a key stop on the road to the Academy Awards, and other acting winners on Sunday included Teyana Taylor, Rose Byrne, Wagner Moura and Stellan Skarsgård. Unlike the Oscars, the Globes also reward TV shows, and the night saw British actors Stephen Graham, Owen Cooper and Erin Doherty pick up more honours for their performances in Netflix drama Adolescence. Chalamet's 'sweet' win With all eyes on the Oscars race, Timothée Chalamet's victory has given him a boost over his rivals. "I'm in a category with many greats," he said when accepting his trophy. It was Chalamet's fifth Globes nomination, but his first win. "My dad instilled in me a spirit of gratitude growing up, always be grateful for what you have," he said. "It's allowed me to leave this ceremony in the past empty handed, my head held high, grateful just to be here. But I'd be lying if I didn't say those moments make this moment that much sweeter. "For my parents, for my partner, I love you so much," he added, looking at girlfriend Kylie Jenner. Jessie Buckley says win is 'real honour' Jessie Buckley was named best actress for her role in the adaptation of Maggie O'Farrell's best-selling novel Hamnet, about the death of William Shakespeare's son. "This is not a normal feeling or situation to be in," she said in her acceptance speech. "It was such an extraordinary set to be part of, because we were telling the story of probably the most famous Brit that ever lived, and we had a Chinese director, a lot of Irish, a mostly Polish crew, beside our British family." She concluded: "This is a real honour, I love being part of this industry." Shortly afterwards, Hamnet director Chloe Zhao looked visibly shocked when the movie was announced as the winner of best drama film. Accepting the prize, producer Steven Spielberg said he had "loved the book" by O'Farrell, but felt Zhao was "the only film-maker on the face of the planet who could tell the story". Zhao said: "The village of Hamnet that made this film together. Some of them lost their loved ones while we were making this film, and some of them are still struggling, and I just wanted to say we're thinking of you, we're here because of you, we love you." Teyana Taylor's tearful message Elsewhere, singer and actress Teyana Taylor, whose career started when she choreographed a Beyonce music video at the age of 15, cemented her Hollywood breakthrough by winning best supporting film actress for One Battle After Another. After tearfully thanking a list of people, she used her acceptance speech to send a message to "my brown sisters and little brown girls watching tonight". "Our light does not need permission to shine," she told them. "We belong in every room we walk into. Our voices matter and our dreams deserve space." Swedish actor Stellan Skarsgård, 74, won best supporting actor for Sentimental Value, and joked that he hadn't prepared a speech "because I thought that I was too old". He then made an impassioned plea for people to see films like his on the big screen. "Cinema should be seen in cinemas," he said to cheers from the crowd. Australia's Rose Byrne was named best actress in a film musical or comedy for If I Had Legs I'd Kick You, and paid tribute to members of her family. "My brother's my date. Thanks, George," she laughed. "Thanks to my mum and dad, who bought Paramount+ so they could watch the Golden Globes from Sydney. "And I want to thank my husband, Bobby Cannavale. He couldn't be here because, um, we're getting a bearded dragon, and he went to a reptile expo in New Jersey. So thank you, baby." Meanwhile, KPop Demon Hunters won best animated film and best song for Golden. Brazilian political thriller The Secret Agent was named best international film, while its star Wagner Moura won best drama actor. "This is a film about generational trauma," Moura said, "and I think that if trauma can be passed along generations, values can too. So this is to the ones that are sticking with their values in difficult moments." Paul Thomas Anderson won best film director and screenplay for One Battle After Another. "You guys are being so generous with this affection for me and this film," Anderson said, adding: "I love doing what I do." Adolescence star 'still learning' British teenager Owen Cooper continued a year of adulation and awards acclaim for his performance in Adolescence, winning best TV supporting actor. The 16-year-old from Warrington appears to be keeping his feet on the ground, telling the assembled A-listers: "I'm still very much an apprentice. I'm still learning every day. I'm still learning from the people that are sitting in front of you and sitting in front of me." And he still seems in disbelief at his meteoric rise, remarking: "It's mad, what is going on?" before signing off with the motto of his beloved Liverpool FC: "You'll never walk alone." Seth Rogen also won a TV prize, and had a sense of deja-vu after setting an epsiode of his Apple TV comedy The Studio at the Golden Globes. "This is so weird, we just pretended to do this and now it's happening," he said when picking up the trophy for best TV comedy actor. "I thought the only way I would get to hold one is to create a whole show to give myself a fake one." Other TV winners included Jean Smart for Hacks, Noah Wyle for The Pitt and Michelle Williams for Dying for Sex. And the event's first ever award for best podcast went to Amy Poehler, a former Golden Globes host, for Good Hang with Amy Poehler.

**Excerpt**

Most of Uganda's population is under 17 - will they give an 81-year-old another term? Whether decked in the bright yellow of the ruling party or donning the revolutionary red of the main opposition, young people are dominant among the foot soldiers of Uganda's election campaign. In crowded public grounds and roadside gatherings, young supporters belting out party songs and filming events on their phones outnumber all others. Their opinions may be diametrically opposed but they are held with equivalent zeal. "Bobi Wine is a good guy. If he gets to power, I believe he will take the country to a certain point in terms of development. We just need to trust him and allow him to bring out his potential," Steven Bagasha Byaruhanga tells the BBC at a packed opposition rally in a village in south-western Uganda. Although Ndyasima Patrick supports the status quo, he was also at the rally, presumably to hear what Bobi Wine has to say. But Patrick wasn't swayed. "I support President Yoweri Museveni in this election because he has kept us alive all these years. He may have been in power for a long time but we haven't got the right one yet. Bobi Wine seems qualified but this is not his time yet, maybe 2031," he says. Thursday's presidential election is a rematch of the 2021 contest with 81-year-old Museveni, in power for four decades, being challenged once again by the relatively youthful former pop star, 43-year-old Bobi Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi. The campaign's high energy is a reminder that in a country where the median age is just 17, politics is overwhelmingly fuelled by the young. Forty years ago, Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher were in their pomp, Diego Maradona lifted the World Cup for Argentina, Whitney Houston had a smash hit with The Greatest Love of All and rebel leader Yoweri Museveni seized power in Uganda. For the vast majority of Ugandans, those other figures only live on in the memories of their parents but Museveni remains the only president they have known. The ruling National Resistance Movement (NRM) is campaigning under the slogan "Protecting the Gains", urging continuity and stability. "Look at Uganda - 40 years ago, we were among the biggest exporters of refugees in all neighbouring countries surrounding us. Right now, Uganda is the biggest host of refugees in Africa," NRM spokesperson Emmanuel Lumala Dombo tells the BBC, as he lists the gains his party is seeking to defend. Bobi Wine's National Unity Platform (NUP), on the other hand, is mobilising the electorate with the slogan "Protest Vote", a message that emphasises urgency and generational change. "This election is about liberation, it's about freedom, it's about people asserting their voices," says Bobi Wine, who has become the most prominent political conduit for youth frustration. Both appeals are aimed at the same young audience, but they imagine Uganda's future in fundamentally different ways. Museveni's search for a seventh successive election victory underscores the paradox. Uganda is one of the youngest countries in the world, but its political system is dominated by leaders who came to power decades ago and have never left. This tension is not unique to Uganda. Across much of Africa, youthful societies remain governed by ageing elites who have successfully outmanoeuvred constitutional limits and political pressure to step aside. Uganda's youth bulge is both its greatest asset and its most volatile risk. Each year, hundreds of thousands of young people enter the labour market, but the economy struggles to absorb them. Genuine opportunities to change things, meanwhile, remain tightly controlled. Protest is often met with arrests, intimidation and violence - a response that has only deepened anger rather than suppressed it. Across the region, young people are no longer waiting quietly. In neighbouring Kenya, youth-led protests over governance and economic hardship have shaken the political establishment. In Tanzania, long regarded as politically subdued, new forms of activism are emerging and protests over last year's elections left many dead. Mozambique has experienced violent unrest fuelled by unemployment and inequality. And in Madagascar, the military took over last year after youth-led protests caused the president to flee. These developments are being closely watched in Uganda, both by young activists seeking inspiration, and by a government determined to prevent similar unrest. Against this backdrop, many observers see Thursday's election less as a genuine search for public legitimacy and more as a managed security operation aimed at containing dissent. Fergus Kell, research fellow with the London-based Chatham House think tank has written about a "heavily militarized" politics where the NRM has used "state machinery to protect its own authority by suppressing alternative centres of power". Museveni is widely expected to win. Uganda's electoral history, with observers frequently criticising how free and fair the polls actually were, suggests that a different outcome is unlikely. Last week, the UN's human rights office said the elections would "take place in an environment marked by widespread repression and intimidation against the political opposition, human rights defenders, journalists and those with dissenting views". Netherlands-based academic Prof Kristof Titeca says the "rituals of democratic competition" are on show but the "outcome is predetermined". Many contend that this year's vote has seen less electoral violence than the last one when at least 54 people died. One reason may be that the 2021 election was held amid the Covid-19 pandemic, when the authorities here enforced restrictions more strictly. Beyond the two leading camps, several smaller opposition parties are also contesting the election, though with far less visibility and organisational reach. Long-established parties such as the Forum for Democratic Change (FDC) and the Democratic Party (DP) continue to field presidential candidates and parliamentary hopefuls, drawing on older support bases, particularly among urban professionals and sections of the middle class. But years of internal divisions have left them struggling to compete, and though unlikely to alter the outcome of the presidential race, these parties continue to shape local contests and parliamentary dynamics. For many younger voters, however, these traditional opposition parties are seen as part of an earlier political era, unable to channel the urgency and confrontational feeling that now defines youth-led activism. Beyond the predictable result, the January election highlights a more fundamental question: What happens after Museveni? The tension running through the campaign betrays a regime unsettled by the prospect of life after an octogenarian president. "Only a fool or a snake-oil salesman would claim to have a single definitive answer. Many outcomes are possible," wrote one of Uganda's most seasoned journalists, Charles Onyango-Obbo, three years ago, when considering the post-Museveni era. Speculation about Museveni's retirement plans has persisted for 25 years. "Ever since 2001, we've been having transitional elections. But every hint of departure has been followed by constitutional amendments including the removal of presidential term limits and age limits - reforms that have enabled him to remain in office indefinitely," says political analyst Monday Akol Amazima. More recently, the clearest indications of an impending shift have surfaced inside the centres of power themselves, particularly within the armed forces. At the heart of this is Gen Muhoozi Kainerugaba, Museveni's son, whose growing prominence has recast long-standing questions about succession into more immediate and tangible ones. His swift accumulation of authority, coupled with an increasingly public profile, has made the prospect of a hereditary transfer of power a central feature of political debate. After taking command of the land forces in 2021, Gen Kainerugaba's rise accelerated rapidly. By the middle of the decade, he was overseeing the entire military, even as he cultivated a national following beyond the barracks. In 2022, he traversed the country with a series of highly choreographed "birthday" parties for himself that doubled as political rallies, before unveiling the Patriotic League of Uganda party, an organisation widely interpreted as a testing ground for his future political ambitions. Despite speculation that he might run for the presidency, he later declared allegiance to his father's re-election bid. However, his messaging continues to position him as a leader-in-waiting. The shift became more pronounced in March 2024, when Gen Kainerugaba initiated sweeping changes within the senior ranks of the military. Such decisions had historically been the preserve of the presidency, not an active service chief. By moving to reorder the command structure and improving retirement benefits, he signalled both an expansion of his authority and an effort to secure it, neutralising potential resistance while embedding loyalists in strategic roles across the security apparatus. Yet NRM spokesperson Dombo downplays suggestions that Museveni is grooming his son as an heir. He insists the party has clear internal processes for leadership succession, adding that if Gen Kainerugaba were to express interest in a political position through the NRM, he would be required to follow those established channels. "Whether Gen Muhoozi would want to exploit his advantage as a military leader, he should also know that there are other things he must still prove, so that the combination of them can portray him as a leader he may choose to be," Dombo says. Bobi Wine, for his part, remains sceptical that Museveni is preparing to step aside. He draws parallels with Zimbabwe's former President Robert Mugabe, who clung to power into his 90s before being removed by the military. "Just like Mugabe, and all these other dictators. He will not step down, I can guarantee you. Because he believes this country belongs to him and his family," the opposition leader argues. These days, the memory of Museveni's rise to power and challenge to dictator Idi Amin has little emotional pull. Against that backdrop, the election has taken on a significance that extends well beyond individual candidates. It has become a referendum on whether to preserve an established order rooted in historical achievement and or respond to a younger generation's insistence on inclusion, fairness and meaningful participation in public life. What is unmistakable is that Uganda's youth are no longer passive observers. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

And Governor Tim Walz has expressed concerns that a probe conducted only by federal officials could be biased. Local officials have said they will conduct their own review. The state is also suing the federal government over ICE's deployment there. A jurisdiction battle This case, which involves a federal officer, falls under the jurisdiction of the federal government, according to Gray. Still, D'Amico said it was unusual to see administration officials coming to conclusions about a shooting before all evidence had been collected. In the days after Good was killed, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Vice-President JD Vance and President Donald Trump all gave public statements saying the ICE officer was in the right to fire at Good. D'Amico said FBI agents will gather the facts of what happened, but cautioned that the final determination of the shooting's justification could be "adversely affected" by the politics surrounding it. "If you're on a shooting review board for the Department of Homeland Security and your secretary said it's justified, your president said it's justified and your vice-president said it's justified, how do you then look at the facts and say 'I don't think it's justified'?" D'Amico said.

The Indian superstar taking a shot at political greatness India's southern state of Tamil Nadu has a long, peculiar political tradition: here, cinema doesn't merely entertain, it also governs. From extremely successful political stints of MG Ramachandran - popularly known as MGR - and Jayalalithaa to the more ambivalent experiments of Rajnikanth, Kamal Haasan, Khushbu and Vijayakanth, the state has repeatedly seen cinema icons turn into full-time politicians. MGR and Jayalalithaa even became chief ministers. Now Tamil superstar C Joseph Vijay, known as "Thalapathy" Vijay (General Vijay), is the latest to join the list. He launched his political party, Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK), in 2024 and soon after announced that he would retire from films to pursue politics full-time. His upcoming film this month, Jana Nayagan (The People's Hero), would be his farewell release, he said. Vijay's reasoning was explicit: politics, he argued, is not something one can dabble in. Tamil Nadu's voters, he said, deserved nothing less than full commitment. And the state's political history supports that calculation. MGR and Jayalalithaa withdrew from active stardom before consolidating power. But Kamal Haasan's hybrid approach, which involves being active in cinema and politics both, has yielded limited electoral results. Vijayakanth's party rose quickly but faltered organisationally. Tamil politics has little patience for half-measures. It is against this unforgiving backdrop that Jana Nayagan arrives. Steeped in political imagery and rhetoric, Vijay's new film will open in nearly 5,000 cinemas across India and overseas this month. At 51, the star is stepping away from a career most actors would be reluctant to leave. He remains among Indian cinema's most bankable stars, driving festival releases and revenues across the global Tamil diaspora - from satellite rights and music to merchandise. Chennai-based film critic Aditya Shrikrishna noted that Vijay's appeal has not rested on acting prowess alone. "He's not a Kamal Haasan or Rajinikanth in terms of filmography," he said. "But his box office pull and fandom are huge and undeniably influential. Dancing, comedy and a keen understanding of populist cinema are his strengths." Vijay's stardom, however, has never been accidental, said Pritham K Chakravarthy, film academic and critic. "The seed was planted by his father who had Communist leanings and was keen on joining politics." Vijay began as a child actor in the 1980s and was launched as a lead actor in 1992 by his parents - filmmaker SA Chandrasekhar and singer-writer Shoba Chandrasekhar - with Naalaiya Theerpu. The film flopped, but his career did not. Over the next three decades, he appeared in nearly 70 films, charting a carefully calibrated rise - from playing the romantic hero in his films in the late 1990s to acting as an angry young man in the 2000s to a carefully-honed image as saviour and vigilante in films after 2012. Though Vijay's early roles often leaned into hyper-masculine tropes, he later "consciously course-corrected his image", points out Shrikrishna. He later started projecting a saviour figure rooted in social justice in his movies. He spoke of farmers' distress in Kaththi, healthcare corruption in Mersal, supporting women's sports in Bigil and electoral manipulation in Sarkar. "Now it's a different Vijay. His on-screen persona as incorruptible, restrained, morally upright, mirrored the ethical imagination of Dravidian politics, a cinematic grammar Tamil audiences recognise instinctively," says Chakravarthy. Long before Vijay launched his party, his cinema had thus already done the ideological groundwork. Audio launches doubled as soft political addresses. Fan clubs quietly transformed into grassroots networks. The fandom is intense and ritualistic, with celebratory first-day screenings, midnight and 04:00 shows, milk offerings on towering cut-outs, garlands, drums, and whistles. "Vijay remains capable of turning a movie release into a mass civic event. He is perhaps the last of the mega stars of this scale," Shrikrishna said. Not surprisingly, Jana Nayagan leans unapologetically into that mythology. With CGI-enhanced action, thunderous fight sequences and dialogue like, "I enter politics not to plunder, but to serve", the film blurs fiction and intent. It echoes Vijay's rally speeches where he has attacked the ruling DMK, mocking Chief Minister MK Stalin as "uncle", while also positioning himself firmly against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). "Many of the youth, who are vocally tired of over 50 years of Dravidian parties ruling the state, pin their hopes on Vijay as he poses as an alternative," said Chakravarthy. Tamil Nadu goes to the polls in April and May, with Gen Z voters expected to make up nearly one-fifth of the electorate. Political analyst Sumanth C Raman said Vijay has a considerable following among Gen Z, many of whom are disillusioned with Tamil Nadu's long-ruling Dravidian parties, rooted in regional identity and social justice politics. "His rallies draw massive crowds, but whether that movie glamour translates into loyal votes remains to be seen." A deadly crowd crush at a TVK rally in Karur in September 2025 killed 40 people, raising sharp criticism of his party's organisational readiness and Vijay's leadership. The crowd surge forced him to halt his speech, and he faced backlash for not visiting victims immediately - though he later called the tragedy "shattering" and announced financial aid. "Fleeing the scene in a crisis is a red flag," cautioned Chakravarthy. A month later, Vijay met victims' families and promised support. So far, Vijay's platform rests on broad themes - anti-corruption, social justice, Tamil pride and resistance to what he calls authoritarianism by the federal government. Raman described it as broad but shallow. "Beyond sweeping statements and positioning himself as a future chief minister of the state, he has not shared a credible programme or sharp manifesto." The ruling DMK in the state has so far dismissed his political ambitions. DMK spokesperson Manuraj Shunmugasundaram said that as far as movie stars aspiring to led the state are concerned: "Tamil Nadu has seen many Vijays." He added that "Vijay's party is untested electorally" and it lacked clear policies on state or national socio-economic issues. Some analysts also noted that the party lacked a credible second-tier leadership and unresolved alliance questions. TVK says the BJP is its ideological opposite, and calls the DMK its political enemy. It has hinted at closeness to the Congress party - though whether this consolidates votes or splits the opposition is unclear. "Vijay could upset some electoral carts if he chooses to align with the state's main opposition AIADMK party to take on the ruling DMK. Whether he will play his cards well is to be seen," says Raman. The actor casts himself as a moral corrective on screen and in politics, drawing an emotional, almost devotional loyalty rather than debate. When Jana Nayagan reaches theatres, audiences will cheer and whistle - and mark the end of an era. But it's not clear if his box-office dominance can survive Tamil Nadu's unforgiving electoral terrain.

### 12. [Referee and student among hundreds killed in Iran protests](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd0yldn0n7eo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

Referee and student among hundreds killed in Iran protests A referee and a student are among hundreds of people reportedly killed during massive anti-government protests in Iran. Coach Amir Mohammad Koohkan, 26, was hit by live ammunition on 3 January during protests in the town of Neyriz, his friend told BBC Persian. "Everyone knew him for his kindness", they said, adding his family is grieving and "angry because he was killed by the regime". Five days later, student Rubina Aminian, 23, was shot from behind during a protest in Tehran, according to human rights groups. "She fought for things she knew were right", her uncle told CNN. Nearly 500 protesters and 48 security personnel have been killed in two weeks of protests, a US-based rights group says. Sources in Iran have told the BBC the death toll is likely higher than reported. Demonstrations began on 28 December over the economy in the capital Tehran and have spread to 186 cities and all 31 provinces, according to the Human Rights Activist News Agency (HRANA). The protests have grown into the largest in years, with calls for an end to the Islamic Republic and rule of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The protests led to a government crackdown, with at least 10,600 people reportedly arrested and 496 protesters killed, according to HRANA. Medical staff in Iran have described hospitals overwhelmed with dead and injured patients. BBC Persian verified that 70 bodies were brought to Poursina Hospital in Rasht city on 9 January, and the BBC counted 180 body bags in footage from one morgue near Tehran thought to have been filmed on the same night. The BBC and most other international news organisations are unable to report from inside Iran, and the Iranian government has imposed an internet shutdown since Thursday, making obtaining and verifying information difficult. Among the protest victims was Koohkan, who was killed in Neyriz in south-west Fars Province, his friend told BBC Persian. The friend did not witness the incident firsthand, but heard from eyewitnesses at the scene. "It was far too soon for him, really far too soon. He was so young," the friend said. The friend said they had known Koohkan, an indoor futsal (a form of football) coach and referee, for 10 years: "From childhood he was my coach, then he became like my brother." They described Koohkan, who had one brother, as "someone who didn't like to see people in this state... in this misery". "Everyone knew him for his kindness and good nature. The whole town loved him," his friend said. "The family are both grieving and angry. Grieving because they lost their son, angry because he was killed by the regime." Also killed was Aminian, a Kurdish student who was shot from behind while taking part in a protest on Thursday, according to three rights groups. Two groups - Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHRNGO) and Kurdish organisation Hengaw - said she was shot in the head, while the Kurdistan Human Rights Network said she was shot in the back. Both Kurdish groups said she was shot by government forces. The BBC has been unable to independently verify the circumstances of her death. The 23-year-old, whose first name has also been spelled Robina or Roubina, was studying textile and fashion at Shariati Technical and Vocational College in Tehran, IHRNGO said. "She was a strong girl, a courageous girl, and she was not someone you could control and make decisions for," her uncle told CNN. "She fought for things she knew were right and fought hard." He added that she was "thirsty for freedom, thirsty for women's rights". "Overall, she was a girl who was alive, who lived." Members of Aminian's family travelled from their hometown in Kermanshah, western Iran, to Tehran to identify her body after learning of her death, a source close to the family told INRNGO. The family had to search through hundreds of bodies of young people killed in the protests at a location close to her college, the source said. "It wasn't just my daughter; I saw hundreds of bodies with my own eyes," Aminian's mother said, in a statement from the source. Iranian authorities allegedly initially refused to hand over Aminian's body to her family, then prevented her burial or mourning ceremonies in their hometown, the source said. The family was reportedly forced to bury her along the road between Kermanshah and Kamyaran. Iranian leader Khamenei has called anti-government protesters "troublemakers," while US President Donald Trump has threatened to intervene and said the US military is considering "very strong options". Iran has also accused protesters of being backed by the US and Israel. The protests have been the most widespread since an uprising in 2022 sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish woman who was detained by morality police for allegedly not wearing her hijab properly. Then, more than 550 people were killed and 20,000 detained, according to human rights groups.
