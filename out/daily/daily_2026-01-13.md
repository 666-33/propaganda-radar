Le Pen's political fate rests on appeal trial opening in France A high-stakes appeal by far-right French politician Marine Le Pen starts on Tuesday against a ruling that banned her from running for public office for five years. Le Pen, 57, was found guilty last year of embezzling EU funds and if the ban is upheld she will not be able to stand in the 2027 presidential election. She insists she has not committed "the slightest irregularity". Ahead of the appeal, the president of her National Rally party, Jordan Bardella, said barring her from the election would be "deeply worrying for democracy". Bardella said he would not stand for president next year but would instead seek the lower-ranking post of prime minister. The case at the Paris Court of Appeal will last until 12 February but a ruling is not expected before the summer, well ahead of next year's presidential vote. Last year's case centred on charges that Le Pen, along with more than 20 other senior party figures, hired assistants who worked on her RN party affairs rather than for the European Parliament which paid them. The judge, Bénédicte de Perthuis, said Le Pen had been at the "heart of the system" that saw the embezzlement of €2.9m (£2.5m) worth of European funds. Le Pen was given a four-year prison sentence – with two years suspended and the remaining two to be served with an electronic tag rather than in custody. She was handed a €100,000 (£82,635) fine and banned from seeking public office "with immediate effect". If she loses her appeal she could face an even longer jail term. More than 20 RN figures were also found guilty in last year's trial and the party was ordered to pay a €2m fine, with half the amount suspended. Eleven of Le Pen's colleagues are taking part in the Paris appeal, but 12 have decided not to challenge the original verdicts, including her sister Yann Le Pen who was given a one-year suspended prison term. Addressing journalists on the eve of the appeal trial in the presence of Le Pen, Bardella said the RN leader would prove her innocence. "It would be deeply worrying for democracy if the justice system were to deprive the French people of a presidential candidate, already qualified twice for the second round and now considered the undisputed favourite in the election," he said. Le Pen will be hoping the appeals court overturns the lower-court's verdict and clears her name and path to run for the highest office in France for the fourth time. A second possible outcome would be for the appeals panel to affirm the guilty verdict but remove the "immediate effect" clause. This would enable her to run even if she decided to appeal to the country's highest court – the Court of Cassation – to overturn the guilty verdict. A third outcome could see the appeals judges curtail the five-year ban sufficiently to enable Le Pen to register by the March 2027 deadline. And a fourth would be to leave the lower court's decisions intact. This would make it next to impossible to run – even though she would still be expected to take the case to the Court of Cassation. With the presidential election expected around April 2027, much will depend on the substance – as well as the timing – of the judgements.

### 2. [Former Fed chairs condemn criminal investigation into Jerome Powell](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c394xwdve9lo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

Former Fed chairs condemn criminal investigation into Jerome Powell Three former heads of the US central bank on Monday strongly criticised a criminal investigation into chair Jerome Powell, describing it as a bid to undermine the Federal Reserve's independence. In a statement, Janet Yellen, Ben Bernanke and Alan Greenspan, along with 10 other eminent former officials, rallied behind Powell. "This is how monetary policy is made in emerging markets with weak institutions, with highly negative consequences for inflation and the functioning of their economies more broadly," the former officials wrote. "It has no place in the United States whose greatest strength is the rule of law, which is at the foundation of our economic success," they added. The move by the Department of Justice (DoJ) comes after a year of relentless attacks on Powell by US President Donald Trump. As well as criticising Powell's decisions on interest rates, Trump has launched personal attacks, calling the Fed chair a "major loser" and "numbskull". The president said he did not "know anything" about the investigation. The Justice Department has been contacted for comment. The DoJ probe was first disclosed by Powell in an unscheduled video statement on Sunday. He said the Justice Department had threatened a criminal indictment over testimony he gave to a Senate committee last year about renovations to Federal Reserve buildings. Powell called the investigation "unprecedented" and said he believed it stemmed from Trump's anger that the Fed had not brought interest rates down more quickly. "This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings," Powell said. "Those are pretexts." The central bank lowered the target for its key lending rate three times in the second half of 2025, putting it in a range of 3.50% to 3.75% - its lowest level in three years. But Trump has repeatedly said that the central bank has not cut interest rates as sharply as he would like. The DoJ probe "should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure", Powell said in his statement. Monday's public condemnation of the DoJ move has been signed by former federal government officials appointed by both Democratic and Republican presidents. When asked by Fox News on Monday about the Fed's independence, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt deferred to the Justice Department. "Jerome Powell has proved he's no good at his job," Leavitt said. "As to whether he's a criminal, that's an answer the Department of Justice is going to have to find." Trump has publicly urged Powell to cut interest rates in order to reduce the US government's hefty borrowing costs and to make it easier for Americans to get mortgages and other loans. Last year, he spent months attacking Powell on social media and in remarks to reporters. He floated the possibility of firing Powell, only to quickly abandon the idea, which analysts say would rock financial markets and spark a legal battle. Yellen, who served as Fed chair for a year during Trump's first term before she was replaced by Powell, said in separate comments that the probe was "extremely chilling". "Knowing Powell as well as I do, the odds that he would have lied are zero so I do believe they're going after him because they want his seat and want him gone," Yellen told CNBC. She suggested investors should be concerned about the development. "You have a president that says the Fed should be cutting rates to lower rate payments on the federal debt… It is the road to banana republic." Trump is expected to name someone in the coming weeks to replace Powell, whose term as Fed chairman will end in May. But the Justice Department investigation and subsequent backlash could disrupt the confirmation process. North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis, a Republican who is a member of the Senate Banking Committee, said he would oppose the nomination of Powell's replacement by Trump, and any other Fed Board nominee, until the matter was "fully resolved". Initial reaction in US stock markets was muted on Monday. The S&P 500 was roughly flat in early afternoon trading - a notable contrast to last year, when markets were jolted by perceived threats to the Fed's independence. Global markets also proved "remarkably resilient" on Monday, said Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell. She noted that despite the overall calm, financial stocks did slump, as investors weighed the effects of a possible 10% cap on credit card interest rates. Still, analysts said the market reaction could grow if Trump succeeded in influencing Fed policy. Some Republican lawmakers also raised concerns about how the Justice Department probe might affect the Fed's work. Representative French Hill, the Republican chair of the House Financial Services Committee, said in a statement that the investigation was causing an "unnecessary distraction" and it could "undermine this and future administrations' ability to make sound monetary policy decisions". Senator Kevin Cramer, a Republican member of the Senate Banking Committee, criticised Powell in a statement but added: "I do not believe however, he is a criminal. I hope this criminal investigation can be put to rest."
