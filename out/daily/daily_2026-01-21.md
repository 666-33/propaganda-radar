Could US Congress stop Trump from taking over Greenland? President Donald Trump's push to acquire Greenland has sparked a backlash from Republicans in Congress, as lawmakers voice growing concern about US military interventions overseas. But it remains unclear if enough Republicans are willing to join Democrats to block a takeover of the island territory - and whether Trump would bow to pressure from Congress, or act alone as he's done several times in a second term marked by growing American entanglements abroad. The focus on Greenland has grown into a broader discussion over the Trump administration's unilateral use of military force, along with diplomatic and economic coercion, to project power in Venezuela, Iran and elsewhere around the world. Republicans have largely backed Trump's foreign policy agenda since he returned to the White House. But now, a growing number are siding with Democrats in Congress and Nato allies who say a takeover of Greenland would violate US and international law. In recent days, some Republican leaders have said there's little interest in the US buying Greenland or seizing it through military force. Some Republican lawmakers have also joined Democrats in opposing a new plan by Trump to place tariffs on countries that don't back his bid to acquire the territory, which is self-governed but controlled by Denmark. The proposed tariffs would be "bad for America, bad for American businesses, and bad for America's allies," Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina wrote on social media, adding that the move would benefit China and Russia. "It's great for [Russian President Vladimir] Putin, [Chinese President] Xi [Jinping] and other adversaries who want to see Nato divided." Other Republicans said Trump's ambition to annex Greenland was threatening to undermine the Nato alliance - to which both the US and Denmark belong - in a moment of growing tension between the US and European allies. "Respect for the sovereignty of the people of Greenland should be non-negotiable," Senator Lisa Murkowski, the co-chair of the Senate Arctic Caucus, said in a statement. Trump has argued the US must own the territory to better compete with China and Russia in the Arctic, and has vowed to take it "one way or another". On Tuesday, the US president downplayed concerns that the issue was hurting Nato when asked by the BBC if he was willing to see the decades-old security alliance collapse as a consequence of his push for the territory. Trump reiterated his view that ownership of Greenland was critical for US and global security. "We need [Greenland] for national security and even world security," he said. But Trump's insistence on obtaining the territory is increasingly unpopular on Capitol Hill. Congress has some options to try to rein Trump in, if Republicans and Democrats do choose to pick a fight with the president over Greenland. Congress has the power of the purse and in theory would have to approve funding used to buy Greenland, experts said. Denmark and Greenland have both insisted the island isn't for sale. "If Trump wants to buy Greenland it would require an act of Congress to provide the funds to do so," said Daniel Schuman, the executive director of the American Governance Institute and an expert on congressional procedure. It's unlikely that Congress could repurpose existing funding to buy the territory, Schuman added. Still, the administration has expanded the use of executive power to enact Trump's immigration and tariff agenda, among other issues. The administration might try to claim some new authority to seize Greenland that would allow it to overrule any roadblocks by Congress, Schuman said. Lawmakers worried about a military incursion in Greenland have signalled support for measures prohibiting any US action without congressional approval. But it's unclear if the proposals have enough Republican support to pass in either chamber of Congress. Five Senate Republicans joined Democrats earlier this month to advance a bill that would have blocked the administration from taking further military action in Venezuela, following the attack in December that deposed former President Nicolás Maduro. The Venezuela war powers resolution ultimately failed to get through the Senate. But it signalled mounting frustration from Republican and Democratic lawmakers with Trump's use of military force abroad, after he ran in 2024 on a promise to reduce US involvement in foreign conflicts. Last week a bipartisan congressional delegation visited Denmark in a symbolic show of support for Greenland. It's also unclear how the Senate, which ratifies treaties, would respond if the US reached some sort of agreement with Denmark to take over part or all of Greenland. The US has an existing arrangement with Denmark established in 1951 that allows the US to expand its military presence in Greenland. Murkowski and other Republicans have argued that the US doesn't need to take over the territory to address national security needs in the region. The Senate could try to thwart Trump by opposing a treaty between the US and Denmark, in the event the two nations reach an agreement. Treaties require two-thirds support in the Senate for ratification, which Republicans currently fall well short of. Some Republicans have already indicated that they'd consider breaking with Trump over Greenland. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the former majority leader in the upper chamber of Congress, told reporters that a US takeover of the territory would "shatter the trust of allies". Faced with growing Republican concern over Greenland, Trump could look to strike a deal that falls short of a formal treaty and doesn't require Senate approval. But it's unclear if presidents have the authority to make such agreements without input from Congress, analysts said. "Plenty of international agreements are concluded in forms other than treaties," said Josh Chafetz, a professor at Georgetown Law, but "I'm sceptical that something of this magnitude could be concluded as a pure executive agreement." Trump did not say on Tuesday whether he believed he was constrained by anything in his pursuit of Greenland. Asked how far he was willing to go, Trump told reporters to stay tuned. "I think something is going to happen that's going to be very good for everybody," Trump said. Additional reporting by Kayla Epstein

Israeli PM Netanyahu agrees to join Trump's Board of Peace Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has accepted an invitation to join US President Donald Trump's Board of Peace. A statement from his office said Netanyahu would become a member of the board "which is to be comprised of world leaders". The board was originally thought to be aimed at helping end the two-year war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza and oversee reconstruction. But its proposed charter does not mention the Palestinian territory and appears to be designed to supplant functions of the UN. The United Arab Emirates and Bahrain have also agreed to join, as have Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Morocco and Vietnam. Many others have expressed reservations. It is not clear how many countries have been invited to join Trump's new body -Canada, Russia, Turkey and the UK are among them, but have not yet publicly responded. Norway has said it will not join because the current proposal "raises a number of questions", while France and Sweden have indicated they will do the same. According to a copy of the charter leaked to the media, member states will be given a renewable three-year term, but they can secure a permanent place if they contribute $1bn (£740m) of funding to the board. The document says the Board of Peace will be "an international organisation that seeks to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict". It will "undertake such peace-building functions in accordance with international law", it adds. Trump will be the chairman but also "separately serve" as representative of the US. A US official has said the chairmanship can be held by Trump "until he resigns it", but that a future US president may choose a new representative. As chairman, he will have "exclusive authority to create, modify or dissolve subsidiary entities as necessary or appropriate to fulfil the Board of Peace's mission", according to the document. He will also select "leaders of global stature" to serve two-year terms on an Executive Board that will help deliver the mission of the Board of Peace, US officials say. Last Friday, the White House named the seven members of the founding Executive Board. They included US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Middle East special envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner as well as former British prime minister Tony Blair. Trump also named Nickolay Mladenov, a Bulgarian politician and former UN Middle East envoy, as the Board of Peace's representative on the ground in Gaza during phase two of Trump's peace plan, which should see the reconstruction and demilitarisation of the territory, including the disarmament of Hamas, as well as a full withdrawal of Israeli forces. Mladenov will act as a link with a Palestinian technocratic government which will "oversee the restoration of core public services, the rebuilding of civil institutions, and the stabilisation of daily life". A separate Gaza Executive Board will help support the technocratic government, according to the White House. Witkoff, Kushner, Blair, Rowan, Mladenov will serve on it with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, Egyptian intelligence chief Hassan Rashad, Qatari strategic affairs minister Ali al-Thawadi, UAE minister of state for international co-operation Reem al-Hashimy, billionaire Israeli real estate developer Yakir Gabay, and Sigrid Kaag, a Dutch politician and UN special co-ordinator for the Middle East peace process. On Saturday, Netanyahu's office said the Gaza Executive Board's composition "was not co-ordinated with Israel and runs contrary to its policy". Israeli media said the decision to include representatives of Turkey and Qatar - which both helped broker the ceasefire that took effect in October, along with Egypt and the US - had happened "over Israel's head". Under phase one of the peace plan, Hamas and Israel agreed to the ceasefire, an exchange of living and dead Israeli hostages in Gaza for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails, a partial Israeli withdrawal, and a surge in deliveries of humanitarian aid. Phase two faces major challenges, with Hamas having previously refused to give up its weapons without the creation of an independent Palestinian state, and Israel having not committed to fully withdrawing from Gaza. The ceasefire is also fragile. More than 460 Palestinians killed in Israeli strikes since it came into force, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry, while the Israeli military says three of its soldiers have been killed in Palestinian attacks during the same period. The war was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. Israel responded to the attack by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 71,550 people have been killed, according to the territory's health ministry.

Photos leaked to BBC show faces of hundreds killed in Iran's brutal protest crackdown Warning: this story contains graphic content which some readers might find distressing Hundreds of photos revealing the faces of those killed during Iran's violent crackdown on anti-government protests have been leaked to BBC Verify. The pictures, which are too graphic to show without blurring, reveal the bloodied, swollen and bruised faces of at least 326 victims - including 18 women. The images, displayed in a south Tehran mortuary, are one of the only ways families have been able to identify their dead loved ones. Many of the victims were too disfigured to be identified, and 69 people had been labelled in Persian as John or Jane Doe, suggesting their identity was unknown when the photo was taken. Only 28 of the victims had labels with clearly visible names in the photos. Labels on more than 100 victims, who had their date of death recorded, showed that date as 9 January, one of the deadliest nights for protesters in Tehran so far. The city's streets were set on fire during clashes with security forces, with protesters chanting slogans against the supreme leader and the Islamic Republic. It followed a call for nationwide protests from Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the late shah. The leaked photos provide a small snapshot of the thousands believed to have been killed at the hands of the Iranian state. BBC Verify has been tracking the spread of protests across Iran since they erupted in late December, but the near total internet blackout imposed by the authorities has made it extremely difficult to document the scale of the government's violence against those who oppose it. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has publicly acknowledged several thousand people have been killed but blamed the US, Israel and those he described as "seditionists". Despite the blackout entering its third week, a small number of people have managed to get some information out. Hundreds of close-up images of victims taken from inside the Kahrizak Forensic Medical Centre were leaked to BBC Verify. We analysed 392 photos of victims and were able to identify 326 people - some had multiple pictures taken of them from different angles. Sources claimed the true number of dead at the mortuary ran into the thousands. One source, who we are not naming for their safety, told us they weren't prepared for the level of devastation they encountered inside the mortuary complex, and said they saw victims ranging from as young as 12 or 13 to 60 and 70-year-olds. "It was just too much," they said. Amid the chaos inside the mortuary, family members and friends were huddled together around a screen, we were told. They were trying to identify their loved ones while hundreds of images of the dead flicked across the screen. The slideshow lasted for hours, they said, adding that many of the victims' injuries were so severe they could not be identified. One man's face was so swollen his eyes were barely visible. Another man still had a breathing tube in his mouth, suggesting he died after receiving medical treatment. Some victims were so badly injured that their families asked to see the pictures again and to zoom in on their faces to make sure it was really them, we were told. At other times people recognised their loved ones instantly and were seen collapsing to the floor, screaming. Many photos showed unzipped body bags with papers laid close to their faces, identifying them by name, ID number or date of death. In some cases, we were told, the only identifier was a bank card laid on top of a body bag – the victims' last remaining possession. BBC Verify has separately corroborated videos from the same mortuary that demonstrate the violence perpetrated against protesters. One shows the body of what appears to be a child, while another shows a man with a clear gunshot wound in the middle of his head. Both videos are too distressing to show. Some Iranians have been posting the names of victims killed by security forces when they manage to connect to the internet through Starlink or even using networks from neighbouring countries, though these opportunities are incredibly rare. We checked the names of victims identified in the mortuary against social media posts reporting the names of the dead and found five matches, but are not revealing the names as we cannot contact the victims' families. BBC Verify has tracked the spread of anti-government protests across 71 towns and cities in Iran since they first erupted on 28 December through verified video, though the true number of areas where demonstrations have taken place is likely much higher. The few images that people have managed to upload through Starlink show burnt-out cars left in the streets, while verified videos recorded rounds of gunshots fired around Tehran during protests. The internet blackout has made it extremely difficult to document the full extent of the death toll from the protests. However, US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) has placed its current estimate at more than 4,000 deaths.

**Excerpt**

Japan restarts world's largest nuclear plant as Fukushima memories loom large Japan has restarted operations at the world's largest nuclear power plant for the first time since the 2011 Fukushima disaster forced the country to shut all of its reactors. The decision to restart reactor number 6 at Kashiwazaki-Kariwa north-west of Tokyo was taken despite local residents' safety concerns. It was delayed by a day because of an alarm malfunction and is due to begin operating commercially next month. Japan, which had always heavily relied on energy imports, was an early adopter of nuclear power. But in 2011 all 54 of its reactors had to be shut after a massive earthquake and tsunami triggered a meltdown at Fukushima, causing one of the worst nuclear disasters in history. This is the latest installment in Japan's nuclear power reboot, which still has a long way to go. The seventh reactor at Kashiwazaki-Kariwa is not expected to be brought back on until 2030, and the other five could be decommissioned. That leaves the plant with far less capacity than it once had when all seven reactors were operational: 8.2 gigawatts. Triggered by the most powerful earthquake ever recorded in Japan, the meltdown in the reactors at Fukushima Daiichi, 220km (135 miles) north-east of Tokyo on the coast, led to radioactive leakage. Local communities were evacuated, and many have not returned despite official assurances that it was safe to do so. Critics say the plant's owner Tokyo Electric Power Company, or Tepco, was not prepared, and the response from them and government was not well co-ordinated. An independent government report called it a "man-made disaster" and blamed Tepco, although a court later cleared three of their executives of negligence. Still the fear and lack of trust fuelled public opposition to nuclear power and Japan suspended all of its 54 reactors shortly after the Fukushima disaster. It has now spent the past decade trying to wake up those power plants, as it seeks to reach net zero emissions by 2050. Since 2015, Japan has restarted 15 out of its 33 operable reactors. The Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant is the first of those owned by Tepco to be turned back on. Before 2011, nuclear power accounted for nearly 30% of Japan's electricity and the country planned to get that up to 50% by 2030. Its energy plan last year unveiled a tamer goal: it wants nuclear power to provide 20% of its electricity needs by 2040. Even that may be tricky. 'A drop on a hot stone' Global momentum is building around nuclear energy, with the International Atomic Energy Agency estimating that the world's nuclear power capacity could more than double by 2050. In Japan, as of 2023, nuclear power accounted for just 8.5% of electricity. Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, who took office in October, has emphasised the importance of nuclear power for Japan's energy self-sufficiency. Especially as it expects energy demand to surge because of data centres and semiconductor manufacturing. Japan's leaders and its energy companies have long pushed for nuclear power. They say it's more reliable than renewable energy like solar and wind, and better suited for Japan's mountainous terrain. But critics say the emphasis on nuclear energy has come at the cost of investing in renewables and cutting emissions. Now, as Japan tries to revive its nuclear power ambitions, the costs of running the reactors have surged, partly because of new safety checks that require hefty investments from companies trying to restart plants. "Nuclear power is getting much more expensive than they ever thought it would," says Dr Florentine Koppenborg, a senior researcher at the Technical University of Munich. The government could subsidise the costs, or pass them on to consumers - both unpalatable options for Japan's leaders, who have for decades been hailing the affordability of nuclear power. An expensive energy bill could also hurt the government at a time when households are protesting about rising costs. The government's "hands are tied when it comes to financially supporting nuclear power, unless it's willing to go back on one of the main selling points", Koppenborg says. "I think [Japan's nuclear power revival] is a drop on a hot stone, because it does not change the larger picture of nuclear power decline in Japan." Beyond the fear of another disaster like Fuksuhima, a series of scandals has also rattled public trust. The Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant in particular found itself embroiled in a couple of them. In 2023, one of its employees lost a stack of documents after placing it on top of their car and forgetting it was there before driving away. In November, another was found to have mishandled confidential documents. A Tepco spokesperson said the company reported the incidents to the Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA), adding that it aimed to continue improving security management. These revelations are "a good sign" for transparency, says Koppenborg. But they also reveal that "Tepco is struggling to change its ways [and] the way it approaches safety". Earlier this month, the NRA suspended its review to restart nuclear reactors at Chubu Electric's Hamaoka plant in central Japan, after the company was found to have manipulated quake data in its tests. The company apologised, saying: "We will continue to respond sincerely, and to the fullest extent possible, to the instructions and guidance of the NRA." Hisanori Nei, a former senior nuclear safety official, tells the BBC, while he was "surprised" by the scandal at Hamaoka, he believed the harsh penalty handed to its operator should deter other companies from doing the same. "Power companies should recognise the importance not to [falsify data]," he said, adding that authorities will "reject and punish" offending companies. Surviving another Fukushima What happened at Fukushima turned Japanese public opinion against what had been hailed as an affordable and sustainable form of energy. Thousands of residents filed class action lawsuits against Tepco and the Japanese government, demanding compensation for property damage, emotional distress and health problems allegedly linked to radiation exposure. In the weeks after the March 2011 disaster, 44% of Japanese thought the use of nuclear power should be reduced, according to a survey by Pew Research Center. That figure jumped to 70% by 2012. But then polls by the Japanese business publication Nikkei in 2022 showed that more than 50% of people supported nuclear power if safety was ensured. But there is still fear and mistrust. In 2023, the release of treated radioactive water from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant sparked anxiety and anger both at home and abroad. And many remain opposed to restarting nuclear plants. In December, hundreds of protesters gathered outside the Niigata prefectural assembly where Kashiwazaki-Kariwa is located, voicing safety concerns. "If something was to happen at the plant, we would be the ones to suffer the consequences," one protester told Reuters news agency. Last week, ahead of Kashiwazaki-Kariwa's restart, a small crowd gathered in front of Tepco's headquarters to protest again. Nuclear safety standards have been ramped up after Fukushima. The NRA, a cabinet body established in 2012, now oversees the restarting of the country's nuclear plants. At Kashiwazaki-Kariwa, 15-metre-high (49-foot) seawalls have been built to guard against large tsunamis; watertight doors now protect critical equipment at the facility. "Based on the new safety standards, [Japan's nuclear plants] could survive even a similar earthquake and tsunami like the one we had in 2011," says Nei, the former senior nuclear safety official. But what worries Koppenborg is: "They're preparing for the worst they've seen in the past but not for what is to come." Some experts worry that these policies are not planning enough to account for rising sea levels due to climate change, or the once-in-a-century megaquake that Japan has been anticipating. "If the past repeats itself, Japan is super well-prepared," Koppenborg says. "If something really unexpected happens and a bigger than expected tsunami comes along, we don't know."

**Excerpt**

Life sentence for man who killed Japan's ex-PM Shinzo Abe The man who killed Japan's former prime minister Shinzo Abe has been sentenced to life in prison, three and a half years after he shot him dead at a rally in the city of Nara in 2022. Tetsuya Yamagami had pleaded guilty to murder charges at the trial's opening last year, but how he should be punished has divided public opinion in Japan. While many see the 45-year-old as a cold-blooded murderer, some sympathise with his troubled upbringing. Prosecutors said Yamagami deserved life imprisonment for his "grave act". Abe's assassination stunned the country, where there is virtually no gun crime. Seeking leniency, Yamagami's defence team said he was a victim of "religious abuse". His mother's devotion to the Unification Church bankrupted the family, and Yamagami bore a grudge against Abe after realising the ex-leader's ties to the controversial church, the court heard. On Wednesday, Judge Shinichi Tanaka from the Nara district court sentenced Yamagami to life in prison without parole, as the prosecution had requested. "The act of waiting for an opportunity, finding an opening, and targeting the victim with a gun is despicable and extremely malicious," said the judge, public broadcaster NHK reports. Yamagami sat quietly with his hands clasped and eyes downcast as the sentence was handed down. Nearly 700 people had lined up in the cold to try to get one of the 31 seats inside the courtroom to attend the hearing. Abe's shocking death in broad daylight prompted investigations into the Unification Church and its questionable practices, including soliciting financially ruinous donations from its followers. The case also exposed links with politicians from Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party and resulted in the resignations of several cabinet ministers. Journalist Eito Suzuki, who covered all but one of Yamagami's court hearings, said Yamagami and his family seemed "overwhelmed with despair" throughout the trial. Yamagami "exuded a sense of world-weariness and resignation", recounts Suzuki, who began looking into the Unification Church long before Abe's shocking murder. "Everything is true. There is no doubt that I did this," Yamagami said solemnly on the first day of his trial in October 2025. Armed with a homemade gun assembled using two metal pipes and duct tape, he fired two shots at Abe during a political campaign event in the western city of Nara on 8 July 2022. The murder of Japan's most recognisable public figure at the time – Abe remains the longest-serving PM in Japanese history – sent shockwaves around the world. Calling for a jail term of no more than 20 years, Yamagami's lawyers argued that he was a victim of "religious abuse". He resented the church because his mother donated to it his late father's life insurance and other assets, amounting to 100 million yen ($633,000; £471,000), the court heard. Yamagami spoke of his grievance against Abe, who was 67 when shot, after seeing his video message at a church-related event in 2021, but said he had initially planned to attack church executives, not Abe. Suzuki recalls Abe's widow Akie's look of disbelief when Yamagami said the ex-leader was not his main target. Her expression "remains vividly etched in my mind", Suzuki says. "It conveyed a sense of shock, like she was asking: Was my husband merely a tool used to settle a grudge against the religious organisation? Is that all it was?" In an emotional statement read to the court, Akie Abe said the sorrow of losing her husband "will never be relieved". "I just wanted him to stay alive," she had said. Founded in South Korea, the Unification Church entered Japan in the 1960s and cultivated ties with politicians to grow its following, researchers say. While not a member, Abe, like several other Japanese politicians, would occasionally appear at church-related events. His grandfather Nobusuke Kishi, also a former PM, was said to have been close to the group because of its anti-communist stance. In March last year, a Tokyo court revoked the church's status as a religious corporation, ruling that it coerced followers into buying expensive items by exploiting fears about their spiritual well-being. The church has also drawn controversy for holding mass wedding ceremonies involving thousands of couples. Yamagami's sister, who appeared as a defence witness during his trial, gave a tearful testimony on the "dire circumstances she and her siblings endured" because of their mother's deep involvement with the church, Suzuki recalls. "It was an intensely emotional moment. Nearly everyone in the public gallery appeared to be crying," he says. But prosecutors argue there is "a leap in logic" as to why Yamagami directed his resentment of the church at Abe. During the trial, the judges also raised questions suggesting they found it hard to understand this aspect of his defence. Observers, too, are divided on whether Yamagami's personal tragedies justify a reduced penalty for his actions. "It's hard to dismantle the prosecution's case that Abe didn't directly harm Yamagami or his family," Suzuki says. But he believes Yamagami's case illustrates how "victims of social problems are led to commit serious crimes". "This chain must be broken, we must properly examine why he committed the crime," Suzuki says. Rin Ushiyama, a sociologist at Queen's University Belfast, says sympathy for Yamagami is largely rooted in "widespread distrust and antipathy in Japan towards controversial religions like the Unification Church". "Yamagami was certainly a 'victim' of parental neglect and economic hardship caused by the [Unification Church], but this does not explain, let alone justify, his [actions]," Ushiyama says.

**Excerpt**

Air India crash plane had record of safety defects, campaigners claim Aviation safety campaigners in the United States say they have evidence a plane that crashed in India last year had previously suffered a series of technical failures, including an in-flight fire. The Boeing 787 Dreamliner crashed on 12 June, shortly after taking off from Ahmedabad en route to London, killing 260 people. The Foundation for Aviation Safety, a US campaign group, has sent a presentation to the US Senate outlining its findings, which it says are based on documents that have come into its possession. The official investigation into the accident is ongoing. However, an interim report published in July sparked widespread speculation and controversy. Boeing declined to comment. The aircraft involved in the accident, registered as VT-ANB, was one of the earliest 787s to be built. It first flew in late 2013, and entered service with Air India in early 2014. The Foundation for Aviation Safety says documents show that the plane experienced system failures from its very first day in service for Air India. It alleges these were caused by "a wide and confusing variety of engineering, manufacturing, quality, and maintenance problems". The failures included electronics and software faults, circuit breakers tripping repeatedly, damage to wiring, short circuits, loss of electrical current, and overheating of power system components. In January 2022, it says, there was a fire in the P100 power distribution panel. This is one of five such panels that take high-voltage power generated by the engines and distribute it around the aircraft. The pilots started receiving fault messages during a descent into Frankfurt Airport - and the damage was discovered afterwards. It was so severe, the FAS says, that the entire panel had to be replaced. The 787 relies more heavily on electrical systems than previous generations of passenger aircraft. In an attempt to improve efficiency, its designers got rid of numerous mechanical and pneumatic components, and replaced them with electrical ones, which were lighter. However, this led to problems early in the aircraft's existence, including a major battery fire on a plane owned by Japan Airlines in 2013, which led to a temporary grounding of the 787 fleet. The P100 panel itself was redesigned in 2010 following a fire on board a test aircraft. The Foundation's report has been sent to the US Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which last year held hearings into "Boeing's broken safety culture". The official investigation into the Ahmedabad crash is being carried out by India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB). American officials have also been taking part, as the aircraft and its engines were designed and built in the US. A month after the accident, the AAIB published a preliminary report. This is standard practice in accident investigations, and is meant to provide a summary of the known facts at the time of publication. It will not usually draw firm conclusions. However, a short section of this 15-page report generated significant controversy. It states that moments after take-off, the plane's fuel control switches, which are normally used when starting the engines before a flight and shutting them down afterwards, had been moved from the "run" to the "cut-off" position. This would have deprived the engines of fuel, causing them to lose thrust rapidly. The switches were moved back to restart the engines, but too late to prevent the disaster. The report then says: "In the cockpit voice recording, one of the pilots is heard asking the other why did he cut-off. The other pilot responded that he did not do so." The actual transcript is not provided. That indirectly reported conversation prompted a number of commentators in the US and India to suggest that the accident had been caused by one of the pilots, either deliberately or inadvertently. But there has since been a backlash from lawyers for the accident victims, safety campaigners, a pilots' association and some technical experts in India and the US. They believe the focus on the pilots is misleading, and has diverted attention away from the possibility of a technical problem with the aircraft. Since the report was issued, the BBC has spoken to a range of people within the industry, including pilots, accident investigators and engineers. While theories about what actually happened vary widely, there is a broad acknowledgement that important information is missing. The Foundation for Aviation Safety is an organisation led by Ed Pierson, a former senior manager at Boeing's Renton factory in Seattle, who has been an outspoken critic of the aerospace giant's safety and quality control standards for years. He has previously described the preliminary report into the Air India crash as "woefully inadequate… embarrassingly inadequate". The Foundation says its concerns about the 787 go beyond the aircraft involved in that accident. It says it has also examined some 2,000 reports of failures on hundreds of other aircraft in the US, Canada and Australia. They include water leaks into wiring bays, which have previously been noted by US regulator the Federal Aviation Administration. Concerns about the aircraft have also been voiced in some other quarters. Boeing has always maintained that the 787 is a safe aircraft with a strong record. Prior to the Ahmedabad crash, it had operated for nearly a decade and a half without a single fatality. The BBC has not seen the documents referred to in the Foundation's report. Boeing declined to comment, as the investigation into the Air India crash is still ongoing. It referred queries about the crash to the AAIB. Air India and the AAIB have been approached for comment.

Lyse Doucet: Trump is shaking the world order more than any president since WW2 On day one, he put the world on notice. "Nothing will stand in our way," President Donald Trump declared, to thunderous applause, as he ended his inauguration speech in a cold Washington winter on this day last year, at the start of his second term. Did the world fail to take enough notice? Tucked into his speech was a mention of the 19th Century doctrine of "manifest destiny" – the idea that the US was divinely ordained to expand its territory across the continent, spreading American ideals. At that moment, the Panama Canal was in his sights. "We're taking it back," Trump announced. Now that same declaration, expressed with absolute resolve, is directed at Greenland. "We have to have it," is the new mantra. It's a rude awakening in a moment fraught with grave risk. US history is littered with consequential and controversial American invasions, occupations, and covert operations to topple rulers and regimes. But, in the past century, no American president has threatened to seize the land of a longtime ally and rule it against their people's will. No US leader has so brutally broken political norms and threatened long-standing alliances which have underpinned the world order since the end of World War Two. There's little doubt that old rules are being broken, with impunity. Trump is now being described as possibly the US's most "transformative" president - cheered by supporters at home and abroad, alarm among others in capitals the world over, and a watchful silence in Moscow and Beijing. "It's a shift toward a world without rules, where international law is trampled underfoot, and where the only law which seems to matter is the strongest with imperial ambitions resurfacing," was French President Emmanuel Macron's stark warning on the stage at the Davos Economic Forum, without directly mentioning Trump by name. There is mounting concern over a possible painful trade war, even worry in some circles that the 76-year-old Nato military alliance could now be at risk if, in the worst case scenario, the US commander-in-chief tries to take Greenland by force. Trump's defenders are doubling down in support of his "America First" agenda, against the post-war multilateral order. When asked on BBC Newshour whether seizing Greenland would violate the UN charter, Republican congressman Randy Fine said: "I think the United Nations has abjectly failed in being an entity that supports peace in the world and, frankly, whatever they think, probably doing the opposite's the right thing." Fine introduced a bill called "Greenland Annexation and Statehood Act" in Congress last week. How do America's anxious allies respond, when it seems nothing will stand in Trump's way? Many phrases have peppered this past year of diplomatic contortions over how best to deal with the US's unpredictable president and commander-in-chief. "We need to take him seriously but not literally," comes from those who insist this can all be sorted out through dialogue. It's worked, but only to a point, on trying to forge a united response with Europe to Russia's blistering war in Ukraine. Trump often veers, from one week to the next, from espousing positions close to Russia's, then tilting towards Ukraine, then bolting back into Russia's orbit again. "He's a real estate mogul," says those who see in Trump's maximalist positions his deal-making tactics from his New York property days. There's an echo of that in his repeated threats of military action against Iran – although it's clear military options are still on his now crowded table. He doesn't talk like a traditional politician," explains his top diplomat, the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio when he is repeatedly questioned about Trump's tactics. "He says and then he does," is his highest praise for his president against what he derides as the dismal record of previous incumbents. Rubio has been one of the principal voices trying to backpedal Trump's threats on Greenland, underlining that he wants to buy this vast strategic ice sheet, not invade it. He pointed out that Trump has been exploring options to purchase the world's largest island, to counter threats from China and Russia, since his first term in office. But there is no denying Trump's bully tactics, his contempt for collective action, his belief that might is right. "He is a man of transactions and brute power, mafia style power," says Zanny Minton Beddoes, editor-in-chief of the Economist magazine. "He doesn't see the benefit of alliances, he doesn't see the idea of America as an idea, a set of values; he doesn't give two hoots about that." And he doesn't hide it. "Nato is not feared by Russia or China at all. Not even a little bit," Trump told the New York Times in a wide-ranging interview earlier this month. "We're tremendously feared." If security was the issue, the US already has forces on the ground in Greenland and under a 1951 agreement could send in more troops and open more bases. "I need to own it," is how Trump flatly puts it. And he often makes it clear, "I like to win." There's a growing body of proof that's what it is about. His policy back flips in the past year have been baffling. In the Saudi capital Riyadh in May, we watched how his major speech on his first foreign trip of his second term met a rapturous reception. Trump took aim at the American "interventionists" whom he excoriated for having "wrecked far more nations than they built... in complex societies that they did not even understand themselves." In June when Israel attacked Iran, Trump reportedly warned Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu not to put his diplomacy at risk with his military threats against Tehran. By the end of the week, when he saw Israel's success in assassinating top nuclear scientists and security chiefs, Trump exclaimed: "I think it's been excellent." "Sane-washing" was the phrase coined months ago by Edward Luce of the Financial Times to describe the world's polite portrayals of Trump, the succession of leaders landing at his door with glittering gifts and gilded praise to try to win him over to their side. "Trump's apologists – a more numerous crowd than true believers - work round the clock to sane-wash his policies into something coherent," Luce wrote in his latest column. It was on full display last October when leaders the world over were summoned to join him at the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm El-Sheikh to celebrate his ringing declaration that "at long last we have peace in the Middle East" for the first time in "3,000 years." The first significant phase of his peace plan had brought about a desperately needed ceasefire in Gaza and the urgent release of Israeli hostages. It was Trump's muscular diplomacy that forced Netanyahu, as well as Hamas, to agree to it. It was a major breakthrough only Trump could achieve. But it wasn't – sadly - the dawn of peace. No-one there said the quiet part out loud. Last year Trump's approach was framed as manifest destiny. This year it's the early 19th Century Monroe Doctrine now updated, since the Venezuela invasion, as the "Donroe Doctrine." President Trump now owns it, bolstered by his fervent backers on his team, with his belief that America can act at will in its backyard, and beyond, to protect American interests. Sometimes he is called an isolationist, sometimes an interventionist. But there's always that slogan which returned him to power - Make America Great Again. And his letter to Norway's Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre highlighted his obsessive pique over not winning this year's Nobel Peace Prize. Trump informed Støre: "I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America." "It's a good day to have a Nordic temperament," Norway's Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide diplomatically remarked to me when I asked about this moment. Norway has been calm, with ice-hard firmness, in its defence of Greenland and Denmark and collective security in the Arctic. European responses still stretch across this slippery political ice. Macron has vowed to launch the EU's "trade bazooka" of counter-tariffs and restricting access to the EU's lucrative market. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, one of the American president's closest European allies, has vaguely spoken of a "problem of understanding and miscommunication." UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has strongly and publicly defended Greenland's territorial integrity but wants to protect the strong personal bond he's built over the past year by avoiding retaliatory tariffs. The gloves are off for Trump as he posts the private messages he's receiving from leaders using the old tools of statecraft to try to keep him on side. "Let us have a dinner in Paris together on Thursday before you go back to the US," suggested the French president who also queried, in the midst of praise for other foreign policy successes, "I do not understand what you are doing on Greenland". "Can't wait to see you", wrote Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte, who once called Trump "daddy" for his forceful handling of the Iran-Israel 12-day war last year. Rutte, and others, have credited Trump's blunt threats for forcing Nato members to significantly increase their defence spending in recent years. Trump's warnings, going back to his first term, accelerated a trend called for by previous US presidents and started by Nato members themselves in the shadow of Russian threats. On the other side of the Atlantic, the country which has long lived in America's shadow has been trying to forge a different path forward, albeit with challenges of their own. "We have to take the world as it is, not the way we want it to be," was the candid reflection of Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney on his trip to China last week. It was the first visit by a Canadian leader to Beijing since 2017, after years of sharp tension, and it sent a clear signal of this fast changing world. Trump's astonishing threat to annex his neighbour to the north surfaced again this week in a post on social media which showed the western hemisphere, including Canada and Greenland, covered in stars and stripes. Canadians know there's still a risk they could be next. Carney, the former central banker, rose to Canada's highest office last year buoyed by Canadians' belief he was the best prepared to take on Trump. He responded "dollar for dollar" from the start, imposing retaliatory tariffs – until it became too painful for the much smaller Canadian economy, which sends more than 70% of its trade south of its border. When Carney took to the stage at Davos on Tuesday, he also focused on this jarring juncture. "American hegemony in particular, helped provide public goods, open sea lanes, a stable financial system, collective security and support for frameworks for resolving disputes," he said, adding bluntly: "We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition." On Wednesday Trump will speak from that same podium with the world watching. Asked by the New York Times this month what could stop him, Trump replied: "My own morality. My own mind. It's the only thing that can stop me." That's what lies behind an armada of allies now seeking to persuade, flatter, force him – to change his mind. This time, it's not certain they will succeed.

### 8. [Locked exits, panic and desperate calls for help: Survivors tell of mall fire horror](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1ev4z4n5dzo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

Locked exits, panic and desperate calls for help: Survivors tell of mall fire horror Muhammed Amin is beside himself with grief and despair. His brother, Naveed Memon, was inside Gul Plaza when a massive fire ripped through the densely-packed shopping centre in Pakistan's commercial capital, Karachi. Like dozens of others, he still hasn't been found. "What should I tell my mother when I go home? What should I tell my nieces?" asks Amin. "My nieces are crying for their father - they are asking me why he is late to come home. What should I tell them? How can I tell them that their father is gone?" Housing an estimated 1,200 shops across a basement, mezzanine and three floors, Gul Plaza was a wholesale market that offered a wide range of cheaply-priced products, including wedding wear, toys, decorations, bed sheets, artificial flowers and baby clothes. The city's residents would frequent it in droves, particularly ahead of festivals, weddings and other important occasions. What started the fire is still unknown. But witnesses say the speed at which it spread, a lack of working fire exits and the density of shoppers and stalls crammed into the building exacerbated the disaster. Rehan Faisal, who owned a bedsheet shop, said that he was able to escape because his shop was located near one of the exits - he broke down the door to get out. He said that although his staff had heard there was a fire in one part of the market, they had initially not worried because it was located some distance away from them. "No-one knew it would spread so much," Faisal added, saying it only took about "five to seven minutes" for everything to "burn before our eyes". Shoiab, 19, who worked at a decorations shop, said he first heard about the fire on a lower floor at around 22:00 local time (17:00 GMT) on Saturday night. "Many customers and shopkeepers were coming up... and saying there was a fire downstairs. I was just beginning to comprehend the situation when the shop owner told me to lock up and get out," he told BBC Urdu. "Then suddenly everything was covered with smoke - we couldn't see anything and there was panic and confusion everywhere. People were just running here and there. I knew some ways to get out of the plaza. But the first exit I tried was locked and the crowds were too dense for me to go the other way." With the facility due to close soon, most of the gates of the shopping centre were locked. Senior police official Syed Asad Raza told Reuters news agency that all but three of the centre's 16 exits were locked. Shoiab was among the luckier ones. He fainted amid the smoke, but someone - he doesn't know who - pulled him out of the building to safety. Another colleague who was trying to escape with him is still missing. The confirmed death toll from the fire currently stands at 27, but more than 70 are still missing and the unstable structure of the still smouldering building is making it difficult for rescue officials to go inside and assess the full extent of the disaster. Dr Abid Jalaluddin Sheikh, a senior rescue official, told BBC Urdu that rescue efforts were being slowed further because the structure of the building had been so severely damaged that it was at risk of completely collapsing at any time. He added that many bodies were unrecognisable and they would need to conduct forensic examinations to confirm the exact number of deaths. Meanwhile crowds of people looking for their loved ones have gathered around the building, desperate for any news. Muhammad Qaiser told the BBC that his wife, sister and daughter-in-law were among the missing. "They had said that they were going to the market. The last contact with them was at 20:00 when it was discovered that a fire had broken out. We do not know what happened to them." Qaiser said that officials were unable to help them, describing how his family had been told to visit both the burns centre and the morgue at different times. Another resident, Haroon, said that three of his brothers had been inside the building. Two managed to escape but one was still missing. "My brother called our parents from inside the plaza asking them to save him. He also called his friends and appealed to them, but no one could save him," he said. The survivor, Shoaib, is also still at the building hoping for news of his cousin, Faizan, who worked at a different shop. "Every morning, I used to go to work and back with my cousin. Now I don't feel like going back home without him. I'm waiting for him to be pulled out of the building alive," he said, adding that his phone was ringing all the time because Faizan's family keep asking if he had any news. "I have no answers for them." As the searches continue, anger is growing. On Monday, hundreds of protesters gathered around the building calling for accountability. Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab, who arrived on the scene nearly 24 hours after the fire broke out, was met with jeers. Muhammed Arif, whose nephew is among the missing, says that the relief work did not start on time and that "precious lives could have been saved". Many residents and politicians have echoed the sentiment that rescue officials took long to get to the building. Faisal said that it took a long time for the fire brigade to arrive, "while the ambulances, which weren't even needed at that moment - had already reached". News agency Reuters quoted rescue services as saying that authorities only received the first emergency call at 22:38 on Saturday, reporting that ground-floor shops were on fire. By the time firefighters arrived, the flames had already spread to the upper floors, engulfing much of the building. Murad Ali Shah, the chief minister of the southern province of Sindh, which includes Karachi, has promised an investigation into the fire and response time. And lawmakers from across the political spectrum on Tuesday condemned the fire and called for sweeping reforms in building safety, emergency response and urban governance, as the House debated an adjournment motion on the tragedy. The prime minister is among those who have offered condolences and promised action. But for those gathered at the ruins of Gul Plaza, this is little consolation. "This is the third time in a while that a building has caught fire in the Saddar area of Karachi," said Muhammed Arif. "How long will this continue to happen and how many more people must die?"
