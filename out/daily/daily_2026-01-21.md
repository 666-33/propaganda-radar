Locked exits, panic and desperate calls for help: Survivors tell of mall fire horror Muhammed Amin is beside himself with grief and despair. His brother, Naveed Memon, was inside Gul Plaza when a massive fire ripped through the densely-packed shopping centre in Pakistan's commercial capital, Karachi. Like dozens of others, he still hasn't been found. "What should I tell my mother when I go home? What should I tell my nieces?" asks Amin. "My nieces are crying for their father - they are asking me why he is late to come home. What should I tell them? How can I tell them that their father is gone?" Housing an estimated 1,200 shops across a basement, mezzanine and three floors, Gul Plaza was a wholesale market that offered a wide range of cheaply-priced products, including wedding wear, toys, decorations, bed sheets, artificial flowers and baby clothes. The city's residents would frequent it in droves, particularly ahead of festivals, weddings and other important occasions. What started the fire is still unknown. But witnesses say the speed at which it spread, a lack of working fire exits and the density of shoppers and stalls crammed into the building exacerbated the disaster. Rehan Faisal, who owned a bedsheet shop, said that he was able to escape because his shop was located near one of the exits - he broke down the door to get out. He said that although his staff had heard there was a fire in one part of the market, they had initially not worried because it was located some distance away from them. "No-one knew it would spread so much," Faisal added, saying it only took about "five to seven minutes" for everything to "burn before our eyes". Shoiab, 19, who worked at a decorations shop, said he first heard about the fire on a lower floor at around 22:00 local time (17:00 GMT) on Saturday night. "Many customers and shopkeepers were coming up... and saying there was a fire downstairs. I was just beginning to comprehend the situation when the shop owner told me to lock up and get out," he told BBC Urdu. "Then suddenly everything was covered with smoke - we couldn't see anything and there was panic and confusion everywhere. People were just running here and there. I knew some ways to get out of the plaza. But the first exit I tried was locked and the crowds were too dense for me to go the other way." With the facility due to close soon, most of the gates of the shopping centre were locked. Senior police official Syed Asad Raza told Reuters news agency that all but three of the centre's 16 exits were locked. Shoiab was among the luckier ones. He fainted amid the smoke, but someone - he doesn't know who - pulled him out of the building to safety. Another colleague who was trying to escape with him is still missing. The confirmed death toll from the fire currently stands at 27, but more than 70 are still missing and the unstable structure of the still smouldering building is making it difficult for rescue officials to go inside and assess the full extent of the disaster. Dr Abid Jalaluddin Sheikh, a senior rescue official, told BBC Urdu that rescue efforts were being slowed further because the structure of the building had been so severely damaged that it was at risk of completely collapsing at any time. He added that many bodies were unrecognisable and they would need to conduct forensic examinations to confirm the exact number of deaths. Meanwhile crowds of people looking for their loved ones have gathered around the building, desperate for any news. Muhammad Qaiser told the BBC that his wife, sister and daughter-in-law were among the missing. "They had said that they were going to the market. The last contact with them was at 20:00 when it was discovered that a fire had broken out. We do not know what happened to them." Qaiser said that officials were unable to help them, describing how his family had been told to visit both the burns centre and the morgue at different times. Another resident, Haroon, said that three of his brothers had been inside the building. Two managed to escape but one was still missing. "My brother called our parents from inside the plaza asking them to save him. He also called his friends and appealed to them, but no one could save him," he said. The survivor, Shoaib, is also still at the building hoping for news of his cousin, Faizan, who worked at a different shop. "Every morning, I used to go to work and back with my cousin. Now I don't feel like going back home without him. I'm waiting for him to be pulled out of the building alive," he said, adding that his phone was ringing all the time because Faizan's family keep asking if he had any news. "I have no answers for them." As the searches continue, anger is growing. On Monday, hundreds of protesters gathered around the building calling for accountability. Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab, who arrived on the scene nearly 24 hours after the fire broke out, was met with jeers. Muhammed Arif, whose nephew is among the missing, says that the relief work did not start on time and that "precious lives could have been saved". Many residents and politicians have echoed the sentiment that rescue officials took long to get to the building. Faisal said that it took a long time for the fire brigade to arrive, "while the ambulances, which weren't even needed at that moment - had already reached". News agency Reuters quoted rescue services as saying that authorities only received the first emergency call at 22:38 on Saturday, reporting that ground-floor shops were on fire. By the time firefighters arrived, the flames had already spread to the upper floors, engulfing much of the building. Murad Ali Shah, the chief minister of the southern province of Sindh, which includes Karachi, has promised an investigation into the fire and response time. And lawmakers from across the political spectrum on Tuesday condemned the fire and called for sweeping reforms in building safety, emergency response and urban governance, as the House debated an adjournment motion on the tragedy. The prime minister is among those who have offered condolences and promised action. But for those gathered at the ruins of Gul Plaza, this is little consolation. "This is the third time in a while that a building has caught fire in the Saddar area of Karachi," said Muhammed Arif. "How long will this continue to happen and how many more people must die?"

### 2. [Life sentence for man who killed Japan's ex-PM Shinzo Abe](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c86v5lj39zpo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

Life sentence for man who killed Japan's ex-PM Shinzo Abe The man who killed Japan's former prime minister Shinzo Abe has been sentenced to life in prison, three and a half years after he shot him dead at a rally in the city of Nara in 2022. Tetsuya Yamagami had pleaded guilty to murder at the trial's opening last year, but how he should be punished has divided public opinion in Japan. While many see the 45-year-old as a cold-blooded murderer, some sympathise with his troubled upbringing. Prosecutors said Yamagami deserved life imprisonment for his "grave act". Abe's assassination stunned the country, where there is virtually no gun crime. Seeking leniency, Yamagami's defence team said he was a victim of "religious abuse". His mother's devotion to the Unification Church bankrupted the family, and Yamagami bore a grudge against Abe after realising the ex-leader's ties to the controversial church, the court heard. On Wednesday, Judge Shinichi Tanaka from the Nara district court said the fact that Yamagami "shot [Abe] from behind... when he was least expecting it" showed how "despicable and extremely malicious" his actions were, AFP news agency reported. Yamagami sat quietly with his hands clasped and eyes downcast as the sentence was handed down. Nearly 700 people had lined up outside the courtroom to attend the hearing. Abe's shocking death in broad daylight prompted investigations into the Unification Church and its questionable practices, including soliciting financially ruinous donations from its followers. The case also exposed links with politicians from Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party and resulted in the resignations of several cabinet ministers. Journalist Eito Suzuki, who covered all but one of Yamagami's court hearings, said Yamagami and his family seemed "overwhelmed with despair" throughout the trial. Yamagami "exuded a sense of world-weariness and resignation", recounts Suzuki, who began looking into the Unification Church long before Abe's shocking murder. "Everything is true. There is no doubt that I did this," Yamagami said solemnly on the first day of his trial in October 2025. Armed with a homemade gun assembled using two metal pipes and duct tape, he fired two shots at Abe during a political campaign event in the western city of Nara on 8 July 2022. The murder of Japan's most recognisable public figure at the time – Abe remains the longest-serving PM in Japanese history – sent shockwaves around the world. Calling for a jail term of no more than 20 years, Yamagami's lawyers argued that he was a victim of "religious abuse". He resented the church because his mother donated to it his late father's life insurance and other assets, amounting to 100 million yen ($633,000; £471,000), the court heard. Yamagami spoke of his grievance against Abe, who was 67 when shot, after seeing his video message at a church-related event in 2021, but said he had initially planned to attack church executives, not Abe. Suzuki recalls Abe's widow Akie's look of disbelief when Yamagami said the ex-leader was not his main target. Her expression "remains vividly etched in my mind", Suzuki says. "It conveyed a sense of shock, like she was asking: Was my husband merely a tool used to settle a grudge against the religious organisation? Is that all it was?" In an emotional statement read to the court, Akie Abe said the sorrow of losing her husband "will never be relieved". "I just wanted him to stay alive," she had said. Founded in South Korea, the Unification Church entered Japan in the 1960s and cultivated ties with politicians to grow its following, researchers say. While not a member, Abe, like several other Japanese politicians, would occasionally appear at church-related events. His grandfather Nobusuke Kishi, also a former PM, was said to have been close to the group because of its anti-communist stance. In March last year, a Tokyo court revoked the church's status as a religious corporation, ruling that it coerced followers into buying expensive items by exploiting fears about their spiritual well-being. The church has also drawn controversy for holding mass wedding ceremonies involving thousands of couples. Yamagami's sister, who appeared as a defence witness during his trial, gave a tearful testimony on the "dire circumstances she and her siblings endured" because of their mother's deep involvement with the church, Suzuki recalls. "It was an intensely emotional moment. Nearly everyone in the public gallery appeared to be crying," he says. But prosecutors argue there is "a leap in logic" as to why Yamagami directed his resentment of the church at Abe. During the trial, the judges also raised questions suggesting they found it hard to understand this aspect of his defence. Observers, too, are divided on whether Yamagami's personal tragedies justify a reduced penalty for his actions. "It's hard to dismantle the prosecution's case that Abe didn't directly harm Yamagami or his family," Suzuki says. But he believes Yamagami's case illustrates how "victims of social problems are led to commit serious crimes". "This chain must be broken, we must properly examine why he committed the crime," Suzuki says. Rin Ushiyama, a sociologist at Queen's University Belfast, says sympathy for Yamagami is largely rooted in "widespread distrust and antipathy in Japan towards controversial religions like the Unification Church". "Yamagami was certainly a 'victim' of parental neglect and economic hardship caused by the [Unification Church], but this does not explain, let alone justify, his [actions]," Ushiyama says.

Beckham vs Peltz Beckham: Could Brooklyn torpedo the family brand? Sir David and Lady Beckham's son Brooklyn has accused them of putting "Brand Beckham" first as they built up their global image and business empire. His bombshell statement threatens to derail both their public reputation and their private life. "We've tried to give our children the most normal upbringing as possible," David said in his 2023 Netflix documentary, as Brooklyn was shown checking up on his cooking. "But you've got a dad that was England captain and a mum that was Posh Spice." David went on to say how proud he was, and "so in awe of my children and the way they've turned out" - making the point that his family had withstood the pressures of fame. In hindsight, the clip feels more like a warning about how difficult that is. And while David's sentiments were surely genuine, viewers might also question how much has been said and done for the benefit of the cameras. 'The non-royal royal family' That documentary, and the subsequent series about Victoria, were both made by the Beckhams' own production company, meaning they were ultimately in control of what story was being told. That's part of a strategy that has seen them remain famously protective of their public image as they have grown their global fame and an empire worth an estimated £500m. As well as being perhaps the ultimate celebrity power couple, Victoria has built a career as a fashion designer, and David has business interests ranging from clothing to health supplements. The brand got perhaps the ultimate accolade when David was knighted by the King last year. "They are the non-royal royal family of our celebrity culture, and people have been invested in them and their dynastic branding for the last 25 years or more," says entertainment journalist Caroline Frost. But their documentaries, social feeds and interviews reveal a carefully curated version of their family life. And they stay firmly on message whenever the Beckhams are riding out any scandals and storms, of which there have been a few - from his alleged affairs, to embarrassing leaked emails about not being knighted sooner, to controversy about his role as an ambassador for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. The biggest threat to the Beckhams' family brand could now come from their eldest child, whose explosive post "has ruptured it from within", Frost told BBC Radio 5 Live. After months of rumours about a rift, 26-year-old Brooklyn Peltz Beckham claimed his family "values public promotion and endorsements above all else", and that brand protection went too far. "Brand Beckham comes first," he wrote. "Family 'love' is decided by how much you post on social media, or how quickly you drop everything to show up and pose for a family photo opp, even if it's at the expense of our professional obligations." He also posted: "For my entire life, my parents have controlled narratives in the press about our family. The performative social media posts, family events and inauthentic relationships have been a fixture of the life I was born into." David and Victoria haven't directly responded to Brooklyn's public grievances. The Beckhams have been "incredibly talented at controlling their own narrative publicly", and the brand has strong foundations, according to celebrity crisis PR Lauren Beeching. "The Beckham name operates as commercial architecture, not just a surname at this point, and I would say that architecture is extremely strong. "The Beckhams have decades of goodwill, global recognition and a fan base that spans generations, and also their recent Netflix documentaries were massive global hits and reinforced that stable, emotionally controlled, likeable image of a family." However, the rift with Brooklyn will cause pain both personally and professionally, Beeching believes. "The Beckhams are very protective of their brand, so this will be incredibly stressful for them because it goes against everything they're trying to stand for, which is basically a united family front." Over the past 30 years, the Beckhams have navigated a media landscape that has morphed from a tabloid feeding frenzy into a social media free-for-all, so the instinct to protect their image is perhaps understandable. But some believe they are reaping the consequences of putting their family in the limelight to benefit the brand. The Guardian's Marina Hyde said Brooklyn had been "commodified" since before he was born, with his parents selling pictures and stories from as early as Victoria's pregnancy. But, Hyde added, his parents refined their media strategy as he grew older. "As time went on, David and Victoria acquired more sophisticated advisers who understood the rapidly morphing potential of controlling image and brand, and built a vast and diversified empire for them off the back of it." Others, however, suggest Brooklyn is spoiled, has taken advantage of the family name himself, and shouldn't post on social media about his desire for privacy. Tom Bower, author of 2024 biography The House of Beckham, sympathises with Brooklyn and isn't persuaded by the image his parents project. "The Beckhams are a phoney family," he told 5 Live. "It's a family for a brand, and it's been very successful... "And the truth is, they're not a happy family. They are a commercial product, which has earned them a fortune, but the victims have been their children." However, journalist Hadley Freeman, ghostwriter of Victoria Beckham's 2006 biography, says in her experience they were "both incredibly sweet, incredibly involved with their children, very loving as a family". "At the same time, there is this problem with some famous people, which is that they are addicted to their fame, and they are addicted to how people see them," she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. "It's not hard to imagine what it's like to be a relative within that situation and to feel maybe a little exploited at times, and to see the disparity between what is put on social media and the reality." Brooklyn has now joined another dynasty - his wife Nicola Peltz is the daughter of US billionaire businessman Nelson Peltz. He has embarked on his own career, with a photography book published in 2017, and his own line of hot sauce launched in 2024. But Brooklyn has struggled to build his own brand. "He's described as a nepo kid, benefiting from the Beckham name; a chef one minute, a photographer another minute, just bouncing around careers," says Beeching. "Fair or not, that is the reputation he's got right now. I'm sure they want to build their own power couple image. But I think the Beckhams have much sharper PR." Peltz has similarly embarked on her own career as an actress and director. But an in-law having Beckham in her surname means that David and Victoria no longer have full control of how the name is used. We may or may not find out much more about what's really going on behind the scenes. Going by past form, David and Victoria are likely to attempt to keep calm and carry on. "I think this is the biggest challenge yet," Frost says. "Of course, they'll carry on. They're the Beckhams. They're too rich to fail. They've got too many followings to fail. They've got fashion industries, they've got many legs holding that table up. But it's a huge challenge, that's for sure."

Alleged scam mastermind arrested after being exposed by BBC Cambodian authorities have arrested a prominent businessman featured in a 2023 BBC Eye investigation into alleged online scam operations as part of a wider effort to tackle organised online fraud. Kuong Li, a 50-year-old Cambodian national, was charged with illegal recruitment for exploitation, aggravated fraud, organised crime and money laundering relating to alleged offences committed in Cambodia and elsewhere since 2019. On 15 January, a Phnom Penh court ordered him to be remanded in custody pending further proceedings. Kuong Li was featured in The Pig Butchering Romance Scam, a BBC Eye investigation into allegations of human trafficking and fraud inside scam compounds in South East Asia. That programme, broadcast in March 2023, focused in part on the Huang Le compound, a venue under Kuong Li's ownership in the coastal city of Sihanoukville. The documentary followed the account of 'Didi', a Chinese man who said he left home after being promised a well-paid job, but was trafficked into Cambodia and forced to work inside the walled compound. Didi said he was made to work from 20:00 to 08:00 local time (13:00 to 01:00 GMT), targeting victims in Europe and the United States, and was not permitted to leave the complex. He also shared secretly recorded footage with the BBC and the Global Anti-Scam Organisation (Gaso), a volunteer-run group that helps rescue and support trafficked victims. In a video diary recorded inside his dormitory, Didi said he was told to "keep scamming as long as you're alive", and that he'd witnessed another victim being beaten and dragged out of the office after making a mistake. In desperation, Didi attempted to escape by jumping from the third floor. He later took shelter in a safe house in Phnom Penh, before eventually returning to China. Three years after the documentary was broadcast, he is now working in a factory in southern China. The investigation also featured testimony from another Chinese man, Mi Lijun, who said he became seriously ill while being held at the compound. He was found abandoned on a highway and taken to hospital. The BBC obtained footage of his final hours before he died from organ failure. The documentary identified Kuong Li as the owner of the Huang Le compound and reported that his business empire covered real estate, casinos, hotels and construction companies. He had previously been awarded the royal honorific title 'Oknha' and had been pictured alongside senior officials at public and private events. The BBC put these allegations to Kuong Li and the Sihanoukville province police. Neither responded to the request for comment before the documentary was broadcast. In April 2023, however, the Cambodian authorities issued a letter in response to the programme, confirming Kuong Li as the owner of the Huang Le compound but dismissing the allegations as "groundless". The letter said an investigation led by the Department of Anti-Commercial Gambling Crime on 8 February 2023 had "found no sign of forced captivity or torture", and claimed the documentary did not reflect what it described as the authorities' "utmost efforts" to prevent and eliminate all forms of human trafficking. Kuong Li also rejected the allegations in interviews with Cambodian media. In June 2023, Kuong Li was granted the title 'Neak Oknha', one of Cambodia's highest royal honorifics, a rank above his previous title of 'Oknha'. While Kuong Li remains in pre-trial detention, Cambodian authorities say investigations are continuing into wider networks linked to organised online fraud. The Secretariat of the Commission for Combating Cybercrime said Cambodian courts handled 37 major cases between 2025 and mid-January 2026, resulting in the conviction of 172 ringleaders and accomplices. One high-profile case involved the extradition of Chen Zhi earlier this year. The Chinese businessman and billionaire is accused of masterminding a vast online scam network, trafficking workers into forced labour camps to defraud victims globally. The move was widely seen as a signal that Phnom Penh was responding to mounting international pressure to address scam compounds and related financial crime operating within its borders. Earlier this month, Prime Minister Hun Manet said on Facebook that Cambodia considers "fighting tech-savvy crimes" a priority and aims at "eliminating all negative issues related to online scam crimes". The United Nations estimates that hundreds of thousands of people have been trafficked to South East Asia - in many cases to Cambodia - with promises of well-paid jobs, before being forced to run online scams in harsh conditions inside confined compounds. Across the region, governments have launched parallel crackdowns on online scam operations and the financial networks that support them. In Thailand, authorities have intensified investigations into money-laundering linked to scam centres, seizing assets and arresting suspects accused of moving illicit funds through banks, cryptocurrency platforms, and shell companies. Meanwhile, in Myanmar, authorities have carried out raids on several high-profile scam hubs, detaining thousands of people and dismantling facilities accused of running large-scale online fraud schemes. Many of these sites had been linked to transnational criminal networks operating across multiple countries in the region.

Detained veteran Ugandan opposition figure critically ill in hospital, his party says The health of detained veteran Ugandan opposition figure Kizza Besigye has "reached a critical and deteriorating state", his party says, after he was taken overnight to a medical facility in the capital, Kampala. The 69-year-old politician was driven to a private medical facility under "heavy security", the People's Front for Freedom (PFF) party said, without specifying what he is suffering from. However, prison authorities denied that Besigye's health was dire, describing his overnight visit to a doctor as a "general check-up". Besigye, a former personal doctor to President Yoweri Museveni and one of his longest-standing political rivals, has been in detention since November 2024. The PFF leader was charged in a military court with treason, which carries the death sentence, as well as illegal possession of a firearm and threatening national security. He denies the accusations. Besigye, who has run for president against Museveni four times, has been in detention with his associate Obeid Lutale since they were both dramatically seized in Kenya and taken back to Uganda. Last month, a court denied them bail for the fourth time, saying it was too early to release them as they had not yet entered their pleas. In a statement on Tuesday, the PFF accused Ugandan authorities of denying Besigye proper medical care, noting that his continued detention amounted to a violation of his basic rights. "It is a tragedy that a man who has dedicated his life to the health and freedom of others is being denied his own right to medical dignity," the PFF said, adding: "We hold the regime and the prison authorities fully accountable for his well-being." Frank Baine, a spokesman for Uganda's prisons, denied that Besigye's health was critical, saying the opposition figure was under standard medical supervision. "Kizza Besigye receives necessary treatment like other prisoners and he is fine," Baine said, adding: "This morning he was doing his exercises." But the PFF described Baine's remarks as a "blatant attempt to mask the physical toll" of Besigye's continued detention, insisting: "Our leader is seriously unwell." It demanded that Besigye's personal doctors and family be granted immediate and unrestricted access to him, so they can provide specialised and independent medical care. Speaking to a local TV station, Besigye's wife, Winnie Byanyima, said that her husband had complained of acute stomach pain, a high temperature and he was severely dehydrated. "He was shaking and unable to walk. He is seriously ill and he refused to be treated by the prison authorities," Byanyima, who is a respected human rights advocate and head of UNAids, added. This is not the first time the veteran opposition leader has been taken ill at Luzira Prison, a maximum security jail in Kampala, where he has been held. Last February, Besigye was also reported critically ill after he went on hunger strike demanding justice. Besigye, who last contested the presidency in 2016, has previously accused the authorities of political persecution. In recent years he has been less active in politics and did not contest the general election earlier this month. There have been increasing calls by his family, opposition and human rights groups for him to be released on medical grounds. President Museveni has blamed Besigye and his legal team for the delays in the trial, which he said had resulted in the PFF's leader's continued detention. Museveni, who has held power since 1986, was on Saturday declared the winner of last week's presidential election with 72% of the vote. His closest challenger Bobi Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, got 25%. Wine rejected the results as "fake" and has gone into hiding citing threats against his life.

UK defends Chagos deal after Trump calls it 'act of great stupidity' The UK government has defended a deal to give the Chagos Islands to Mauritius and lease back a key military base, following criticism from US President Donald Trump over its handling. In a post on social media, Trump labelled the move as an "act of great stupidity", months after he and senior US officials endorsed it. Later on Tuesday he confirmed he was "against" the deal. The UK government said it would "never compromise on our national security", while the prime minister's official spokesperson insisted the US still supported the move. The UK signed the £3.4bn ($4.6bn) agreement in May, under which it would retain control of a UK-US military base on the largest of the islands, Diego Garcia. In a post on his Truth Social platform that morning, Trump had said: "Shockingly, our 'brilliant' NATO Ally, the United Kingdom, is currently planning to give away the Island of Diego Garcia, the site of a vital U.S. Military Base, to Mauritius, and to do so FOR NO REASON WHATSOEVER. "There is no doubt that China and Russia have noticed this act of total weakness." He added: "The UK giving away extremely important land is an act of GREAT STUPIDITY, and is another in a very long line of National Security reasons why Greenland has to be acquired." Responding, the prime minister's official spokesman said that the US supports the deal and "the president explicitly recognised its strength last year". He added that it was also backed by the UK's Five Eyes allies, the other members of which - besides the UK and US - are Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Asked if he could categorically say the Chagos deal would go ahead, even though it is still going through Parliament, the spokesman said: "Yes. Categorically, our position hasn't changed." Earlier, a UK government spokesperson said it had acted "because the base on Diego Garcia was under threat after court decisions undermined our position and would have prevented it operating as intended in future". They added that the agreement had secured the operations of the joint US-UK military base "for generations, with robust provisions for keeping its unique capabilities intact and our adversaries out", and noted the deal had been welcomed by allies including the US. Questioned about his position on the deal at the White House later on Tuesday, Trump said: "When they originally were going to do it they were talking about doing some concept of ownership, but now they're looking to essentially just do a lease and sell it, and I'm against that." The Chagos Islands are a "reasonably important area of the globe", he said, adding: "I think they should keep it." "I don't know why they're doing it - do they need money?" Trump added. Mauritius' attorney general Gavin Glover said he still expects the agreement to go ahead. In a statement he said it was "important to remember" that the deal was "negotiated, concluded and signed exclusively between the United Kingdom and the Republic of Mauritius". He added: "The sovereignty of the Republic of Mauritius over the Chagos Archipelago is already unambiguously recognised by international law and should no longer be subject to debate." The agreement followed a long-running dispute between the UK and Mauritius - a former British colony - about sovereignty over the Chagos Islands. The Chagos Islands were separated from Mauritius in 1965, when Mauritius was still a British colony. Britain purchased the islands for £3m, but Mauritius has argued that it was illegally forced to give them away as part of a deal to gain independence. Under the deal agreed in May last year, the UK would hand over sovereignty of the islands to Mauritius, while retaining control of the military base on Diego Garcia. It would lease back Diego Garcia for a period of 99 years - at an average cost of £101m a year. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said that was necessary to protect the base from "malign influence". Before signing the deal, the UK offered Trump an effective veto, because of its implications for US security. Allies of the president had criticised the plan, but during a meeting with Sir Keir in the Oval Office last February, Trump said "I think we'll be inclined to go along with your country". After the agreement was signed in May, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement that Washington "welcomed" the deal. He said it secured the "long-term, stable, and effective operation of the joint US-UK military facility at Diego Garcia", which he described as a "critical asset for regional and global security." Rubio added that "President Trump expressed his support for this monumental achievement during his meeting with Prime Minister Starmer at the White House." A government bill to implement the agreement between the UK and Mauritian governments is currently in its final stages. On Tuesday, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said in a post on X that the prime minister now had "the chance to change course on Chagos". She said that "paying to surrender the Chagos Islands is not just an act of stupidity, but of complete self sabotage". Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, who has long been a critic of the deal, said in a post on X: "Thank goodness Trump has vetoed the surrender of the Chagos islands". Liberal Democrats leader Sir Ed Davey said Trump's comments showed Sir Keir's approach to the US president "has failed". "The Chagos Deal was sold as proof the government could work with him, now it's falling apart," Davey said in a post on X. "It's time for the government to stand up to Trump; appeasing a bully never works." Labour MP and chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Emily Thornberry, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that while the UK should take Trump "seriously", it should not take his comments "literally". She described his comments on Tuesday as an example of "presidential trolling", saying she was "in favour of keeping calm and trying to sit this out". Two British Chagossian women born on Diego Garcia - Bernadette Dugasse and Bertrice Pompe - want the right to return to their place of birth and say they were excluded from discussions over the deal. Pompe told the BBC she views the US president's criticism of the deal as a "good thing" but "only words". Over WhatsApp, Dugasse said: "I want the deal to stop and not [see] money [given] to the Mauritius government." She said Chagossians should be allowed to "sit at the table and decide our future".

**Excerpt**

Spat deepens between Elon Musk and Ryanair's O'Leary Elon Musk has suggested he could buy Ryanair and called for its chief executive to be fired amid a deepening spat between the pair. The budget airline on Tuesday branded the Tesla chief executive an "idiot", and used the extraordinary row to promote its January sale. Musk and Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary have been trading insults over the past week after O'Leary rejected the idea of using Musk's Starlink technology to provide wi-fi on flights. The two are among the world's most outspoken business chiefs, with Musk the world's richest man with an estimated net worth of $769bn (£573bn), and O'Leary running Europe's busiest airline. A statement on Ryanair's X account on Tuesday evening said: "Perhaps Musk needs a break?? "Ryanair is launching a Great Idiots seat sale especially for Elon and any other idiots on 'X'." It came after Musk floated the idea of buying Ryanair several times on X in the past week, suggesting that O'Leary should be sacked for rejecting the use of Starlink to provide wi-fi on Ryanair flights. EU-based airlines must be majority owned by people from the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein. The Irish airline also said O'Leary would hold a press conference in Dublin on Wednesday to "address" Musk's latest move. Ryanair's social media is known for its punchy posts, often mocking criticisms of the airline or weighing in on current events. Last week, after German airline Lufthansa announced it would install Starlink on its planes to provide all passengers with free wi-fi, O'Leary said Musk knew "zero" about flight aerodynamics. He told Irish radio station Newstalk that passengers would not want to pay a small charge for wi-fi on an hour-long flight, and that Starlink hardware would increase fuel costs because of drag. "We [would] have to put an aerial antenna on top of the aircraft. It would cost us about $200-250m a year, in other words about an extra dollar for every passenger we fly. "We can't afford those costs. Passengers won't pay for internet usage... so we're not putting it on board." O'Leary called Musk an "idiot", with Musk using the same insult in response. Airlines have become increasingly important for Starlink, a network powered by thousands of low-earth orbit satellites. The technology is already being rolled out by airlines such as Qatar Airways and United Airlines. Both Musk and O'Leary have been known to court media attention with provocative public statements.

### 8. [Film about Palestinian girl's desperate plea was a 'way to not feel helpless', says director](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clygr0ym00po?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

Film about Palestinian girl's desperate plea was a 'way to not feel helpless', says director "They're shooting at me. Please come get me. I'm scared." When filmmaker Kaouther Ben Hania first heard the emergency phone call recording of Hind Rajab, a frightened six-year-old Palestinian girl begging for help while under siege in Gaza City in 2024, on social media, she says she immediately knew what she had to do. Hitting pause on the movie she was about to make, the Tunisian two-time Oscar-nominee called her producer and they agreed to shift focus to telling the story of the girl, who was killed - likely by Israeli fire, according to a number of media investigations - along with her aunt, uncle and cousins, and two paramedics sent to save her. "It haunted me," Ben Hania tells BBC News about the voice recording, which is the centrepiece of her Oscar-shortlisted docudrama, released in UK cinemas last Friday. "I was really angry, I was sad, I felt helpless, and I hate it when I feel helpless. "I asked myself this basic question, what can I do? I'm a filmmaker, so I can do movies." She adds: "We started working on The Voice of Hind Rajab that way to not feel helpless, to not accept, to bear witness. "Because not doing it, for me, was being complicit in a way." Hind Rajab's car was hit by suspected Israeli fire as she and her family tried to flee bombing during the two-year war in Gaza. Several family members were killed, but Hind managed to answer a callback from the helpers at the Palestinian Red Crescent Society. The ambulance trying to reach her was also shelled, and Hind, her family, and the ambulance crew all died. The Israel Defence Force initially stated none of its troops had been in the area where Hind and the others were killed. But that suggestion was questioned following independent investigations by research agency Forensic Architecture, in colloboration with NGO (Non-Governmental Organisation) Earshot and journalists from Al Jazeera, which concluded that damage to both the car and the ambulance was consistent with Israeli tank fire. The IDF later said it had "conducted raids on terror targets" with forces operating in neighbourhoods in Gaza City, including Tel al Hawa, from where Hind had made her emergency call. The UN cited her case in a commission of inquiry accusing Israel of war crimes, which it denies. An IDF spokesperson told the BBC it is still being reviewed by Israel's Fact-Finding Assessment Mechanism (FFAM). 'Provoking empathy' Ben Hania's film sets out to tell the story - in Arabic and English - of what happened to Hind and her family, from the perspective of the Red Crescent volunteers at the Ramallah call centre in the occupied West Bank. It is "based on true events" and "anchored in truth", Ben Hania says. "At some point, with all this proof, I thought that we are done explaining", she adds. "Cinema can do something better, which is provoking empathy." The feature mixes audio of the girl's heart-rending real final phonecalls with the Red Crescent, with a visual dramatisation using actors to represent the volunteers. They try to keep her calm and conscious as it becomes clear she is surrounded by the dead bodies of her relatives. Critics have praised the emotional impact of the performances, while noting the problems inherent with mixing documentary with drama. Variety's Guy Lodge said it was "impossible not to be moved" by the recording at the heart of the hybrid film, heard at an "agonising distance". But he felt "the ethics and execution of the concept are questionable". In a four-star review, The Telegraph's Robbie Collin said the feature "transcends shock value" and presents viewers with "an ethical dilemma". "I dreaded watching this film," he wrote. "Yet having now seen it, I find my mind changed, thanks largely to the philosophical diligence of Ben Hania's approach." The director - who received the blessing of Hind's mother, Wesam, before making the movie - says she did her best to "respect the testimony" of the volunteers and what they told her about that day. She did not reach out to the other side, because, she says: "My movie is not an investigation. Increasingly stressed scenes play out in the film between call centre worker Omar, played by Motaz Malhees, and his boss Mahdi, played by Amer Hlehel. Mahdi is seeking a safe route approved by the Israeli army - via intermediaries - for his paramedics to make the eight-minute journey to carry out the rescue attempt. Omar becomes exasperated at his boss's insistence on trying to negotiate with Israel. Actresses Saja Kilani and Clara Khoury, as fellow call centre workers Rana and Nisreen, respectively, complete the ensemble cast of actors of Palestinian origin. We watch them hear the sound of gunfire or an explosion in the background before the phone connection is lost entirely. "Even the actors, at some point, stop acting," says their director. "They weren't performing." Malhees confirms this. He tells us he suffered panic attacks during filming and thought his heart was "going to explode" during one scene, which for him was "like a real conversation with a child". "It was a hard experience, but it's worth everything to give." His director stresses she wanted to share with the audience what she had felt the first time she had heard the girl's call for help. "I thought that she was almost talking to me, to save her". She told herself: "I need to go back to this moment when it was possible to save her." Before "the war, mainly, failed her". In another four-star review, the Guardian's Peter Bradshaw said there is "a reckless, ruthless kind of provocative brilliance in what Ben Hania is doing". He wrote: "Is it in bad taste? Problematic? Well, in a world where directors busy themselves and us with made-up stories about made-up people, Ben Hania is at least grabbing one of the most relevant issues of our time with both hands and finding a way to thrust it under our noses." The main question for Ben Hania when making the film was always: "How to make the voice of this little girl echo?", she explains. "Because the world don't want to hear it. It's not a comfortable thing to face. "And for me, it was important to honour her voice and to make it resonate beyond borders." Worried that it would be perceived as "niche", the filmmakers reached out to some famous Hollywood faces - including Brad Pitt, Joaquin Phoenix and Rooney Mara - who signed up as executive producers. Phoenix and Mara were in attendance when the film received a record 23-minute standing ovation following its September world premiere at the Venice Film Festival, where it also won the grand jury prize. "I was like, when will they will stop?" recalls Ben Hania of the "incredible reaction". "And actually they stopped because the theatre asked us to leave, because there was another movie!" "There was a moment of solidarity for real," adds Mahlees. "You could feel that the people are there with you. You are not alone in this world." Two of Ben Hania's previous films - 2024's Four Daughters about teenage sisters who joined IS, and 2021's The Man Who Sold His Skin, about a Syrian refugee who becomes a conceptual art object - were nominated for Academy Awards. Her Golden Globe-nominated latest film is expected to get an Oscar nomination on Thursday, for best international feature, which the director hopes would help the whole world to remember the name Hind Rajab - as the process of trying to find a lasting piece in Gaza continues. "We don't have stars, it's not a feel-good movie," says Ben Hania. "I think it's important to not look away, because this is not a story: this is history in the making." The Voice of Hind Rajab is out in UK cinemas now.

**Excerpt**

The Indian couple who won a $200,000 settlement over 'food racism' at US university A dispute that began over heating a dish in a microwave has ended with two Indian students winning a $200,000 settlement from a US university. Aditya Prakash and his fiancee, Urmi Bhattacheryya, told the BBC they filed a civil rights lawsuit against the University of Colorado, Boulder, after they faced a series of "microaggressions and retaliatory actions" following the microwave incident. The harassment began, the lawsuit alleged, after a university staff member objected to Prakash heating up his lunch of palak paneer - one of northern India's most popular dishes, made of pureed spinach and paneer (considered an Indian equivalent of cottage cheese) - in a microwave on campus, because of the way it smelled. In response to the BBC's questions, the university said it could not comment on the "specific circumstances" surrounding the students' claims of discrimination and harassment due to privacy laws, but added it was "committed to fostering an inclusive environment for all students, faculty and staff regardless of national origin, religion, culture and other classes protected under US laws and by university policies". "When these allegations arose in 2023, we took them seriously and adhered to established, robust processes to address them, as we do with all claims of discrimination and harassment. We reached an agreement with the students in September [2025] and deny any liability in this case," the university said. Prakash said for them, the point of the lawsuit was not the money. "It was about making a point - that there are consequences to discriminating against Indians for their 'Indianness'." The lawsuit has received significant media coverage in India since it was first reported last week, starting a conversation around what many have described as "food racism" in Western countries. Many Indians on social media have shared their own experiences of facing ridicule over their food habits abroad. Some have also pointed out that discrimination over food is rampant in India as well, where non-vegetarian food is banned in many schools and colleges over perceptions of it being impure or dirty. People from disadvantaged castes and north-eastern states often face bias over their food habits, with some complaining about the smell of the ingredients they use. And it's not just Indian or South Asian food - communities from Africa, Latin America and other parts of Asia have also shared their experiences of being shamed over their food habits. Prakash and Bhattacheryya claim their ordeal began in September 2023. Prakash, a PhD student in the Anthropology Department at the university, was microwaving his lunch of palak paneer when a British staff member allegedly remarked that his food was giving off a "pungent" odour and told him that there was a rule against heating foods with strong odours in that microwave. Prakash said the rule wasn't mentioned anywhere and when he later inquired about which foods were considered pungent, he was told that sandwiches were not, while curry was. Prakash alleged that the exchange was followed by a series of actions by the university which led to him and Bhattacheryya - who was also a PhD student there - losing their research funding, teaching roles and even the PhD advisers they had worked with for months. In May 2025, Prakash and Bhattacheryya filed a lawsuit against the university, alleging discriminatory treatment and a "pattern of escalating retaliation" against them. In September, the university settled the lawsuit. Such settlements are usually arrived at to avoid lengthy and expensive court battles for both parties. According to the terms of the settlement, the university agreed to give the students their degrees but denied all liabilities and banned them from studying or working there in future. In its statement shared with the BBC, the university added: "CU Boulder's Anthropology Department has worked to rebuild trust among students, faculty and staff. Among other efforts, department leaders met with graduate students, faculty and staff to listen and discuss changes that best support the department's efforts to foster an inclusive and supportive environment for all." "Individuals who are determined to be responsible for violating university policies preventing discrimination and harassment are held accountable," it added. Prakash says that this isn't his first brush with discrimination over food. When he was growing up in Italy, his school teachers would often ask him to sit at a separate table during lunch breaks because his classmates found the smell of his food "off-putting", he says. "Acts like isolating me from my European classmates or stopping me from using a shared microwave because of how my food smells are how white people control your Indianness and shrink the spaces you can exist in," he says. He adds that there is a long history of food being used to put down Indian and other ethnic groups. "The word 'curry' has been conflated with the 'smell' of marginalised communities who toil in kitchens and peoples' homes and has been turned into a pejorative term for 'Indian'," he says. Bhattacheryya says that even someone like former Vice-President Kamala Harris isn't immune to being insulted over food. She points to a 2024 social media post by far-right activist Laura Loomer saying that if Harris became president, the White House "will smell like curry". Loomer has denied being racist. In the lawsuit, Bhattacheryya also alleged she faced retaliation after she invited Prakash to speak as a guest lecturer on the topic of cultural relativism in her anthropology class. Cultural relativism is the view that no culture is superior or inferior to another as cultural practices of all groups exist within their own cultural context. During the lecture, Prakash says he shared several examples of food racism he had encountered, including the palak paneer incident, without naming anyone. Bhattacheryya says that she also faced racist abuse when she posted a thread on X about the "systemic racism" she and Prakash were facing at the university in 2024. Below the post, there are several comments supporting the couple but also ones that said, "go back to India", "decolonisation was a mistake" and "it's not just the food, many of you don't bathe and we know". Prakash and Bhattacheryya said what they wanted from the university was to be heard and understood; for their hurt and pain at being "othered" to be acknowledged and for amends to be made in a meaningful way. They claim that they never received a meaningful apology from the university. The university did not respond to the BBC's question about this. They have since returned to India and say that they might never go back to the US. "No matter how good you are at what you do, the system is constantly telling you that because of your skin colour or your nationality, you can be sent back any time. The precarity is acute and our experience at the university is a good example of this," Prakash says.

### 10. [Trump greenlit tiny Kei cars but will Americans actually buy them?](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c17xvqlx8r8o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

Trump greenlit tiny Kei cars but will Americans actually buy them? America is known as the land of big cars and even bigger SUVs but Donald Trump has an idea that could change that. The president wants to bring to the US tiny vehicles, like those commonly seen on the streets of Japan, in the form of mini hatchbacks and vans half the size of a Ford F-150 pickup truck. So-called Kei cars - short for kei-jidōsha, literally "light vehicle" - became popular in Japan after World War Two as an economical means of transport in its crowded cities. They have also become popular across Asia. Despite Trump's enthusiasm for micro-cars, importers and drivers in the US aren't so sure they are a viable option in the vast country. Among the obstacles are whether manufacturers can keep prices low, make the vehicles safe enough and if big-car-loving Americans can be convinced to downsize. After a visit to Japan, Trump said in an online post in December: "I have just approved TINY CARS to be built in America." "These cars of the very near future are inexpensive, safe, fuel efficient and, quite simply, AMAZING!!! START BUILDING THEM NOW!" His suggestion marks a shift that would undo a long-running rule barring small American-made vehicles. While there are already some Kei cars in the US, they are a rare sight and have to be at least 25 years old to run legally on American roads. Business accounts manager Nevi Bergeron bought her turbo-charged yellow 1997 Suzuki Cappuccino three years ago after being inspired by the Japanese street racing manga series Initial D. Like most Kei cars, it is so small that two can fit into a standard parking space. "I fell in love with that car and instantly knew I had to get one," said Bergeron, a member of a local enthusiasts group from Maryland and Washington DC called the Capital Kei Car Club. "It's tiny and a bit silly... definitely a conversation-starter. You get a lot of glances when you drive around the city," she said. "I just feel so happy in it." But despite loving the petite coupe, she wouldn't recommend it as a daily runaround. "It is fun to drive but it is not exactly what I'd call safe," Bergeron said. "On a highway next to big trucks, you definitely feel vulnerable." For the same reason, Capital Kei Car Club founder Andrew Maxon drives his Autozam az-1 mini-coupe "like a motorbike" - always assuming that other vehicles, especially trucks, have not seen him. US transport secretary Sean Duffy said as much, acknowledging that small cars would "probably not" be well-suited to American freeways. But these cars could be a "great solution" for people who drive in cities, Duffy said on business news channel CNBC. Smaller cars, smaller prices? Key to Trump's enthusiasm for small cars is the promise of lower prices. A spokesperson for the US transport department told the BBC that the move will help Americans afford vehicles that meet their needs, whether electric, petrol-powered or in the form of a "mini-van or micro". But it is yet to be seen if American manufacturers can build small cars at prices lower than existing sedans. Car prices in the US have yet to return to pre-pandemic levels after a global shortage of computer chips was one of the factors that drove up prices. At the same time, American households have faced a rising cost of living. Carmakers have also warned that Trump's tariff policies could further push up prices, while the ending of a subsidies on electric vehicles (EVs) also means drivers have to pay more for some cars. Hyundai chair Chung Eui-sun warned in his New Year's message that geopolitical conflicts, trade tensions and growing competition this year could cause issues "we have long worried about to become reality" in the car industry. This year, new car sales in the US may fall below 16 million, according to research group Cox Automotive, in part due to concerns over prices as well as lower demand for EVs. In particular, lower income drivers are expected to feel the strain of “prolonged inflation” and the higher price of new and old cars, it added. It is unclear how many car companies will respond to Trump's call. Fiat owner Stellantis said it will start selling the Topolino, a small car with a top speed of under 30mph (48.3km/h), to the US in the coming months. A Stellantis spokesperson said the firm is "always looking for opportunities to adapt our product portfolio to meet our customers' needs" and give them the choice of cars "they want at prices they can afford." Japan's Nissan told the BBC it will assess its line up based on demand. Mitsubishi said it did not have any current plans to bring its Kei cars to the US. Major Kei carmakers like Toyota, Honda and Suzuki said they did not have information to share when contacted by the BBC. Car industry investor Steve Greenfield doesn't believe Trump's announcement will amount to much. Modern Kei cars won't meet US safety regulations and carmakers will need to make huge investments to redesign them to meet American standards, he said. Doing so would "defeat their cost and efficiency advantages", Greenfield added. In the past, manufacturers of small cars have struggled to break into the American market. Kei cars could make sense in crowded urban areas, "but for most use cases in the US, these small cars just simply won't be a viable option," said Greenfield. In 2019, Smart, which is owned by Germany's Mercedes-Benz and Geely of China, pulled out of the US due to slow sales as drivers favoured bigger vehicles. If the fate of Smart cars has shown anything, "there may not even be much of a demand for small vehicles" other than enthusiasts, said Greenfield. That seems to be the case among most US customers who buy Kei cars, said Mo Sulai, an importer at Tokyo Motors DC in Maryland. Imported Kei vehicles cost anywhere from $6,500 for an old mini van or above $10,000 for a Kei fire engine or lorry. Nearly three quarters of the cars imported by his family-run business are "novelty" vehicles like tiny coupes - statement pieces that are popular at events such as enthusiast meet-ups. Mini vans and trucks have also been popular among some drivers who want to use them at golf courses or on farms, Sulai added. "[Trump's] announcement was like a free advert for us because more people start to learn about Kei cars," Sulai said. "But even so, I think people in the US are so used to big cars. This will still be a niche market."

**Excerpt**

Shock and confusion as Spain struggles for answers after deadly train crash Sunday's high-speed train crash in southern Spain, the worst in over a decade, has been a devastating tragedy for the country, with the loss of at least 42 lives. And amid the grief, many are asking what could have caused such a failure on one of Europe's most admired rail systems. The CIAF rail investigatory commission has started analysing why a train travelling north from Málaga was derailed on a straight section of the route, causing it to collide with an oncoming train, which was also derailed. The Spanish government has described the accident as "extremely strange". Three bodies already located in the wreckage were recovered on Tuesday afternoon, and a 42nd victim was also found at the crash site near Adamuz. The shock felt in this sleepy town has been compounded by confusion at how a rail route that ran efficiently for so long suddenly failed. After its inauguration in 1992, Spain's high-speed rail, or AVE, network was seen as a symbol of the country's modernisation. Built with EU funds, it provided a state-of-the-art transport system that was fast, efficient and safe. A derailment near Santiago de Compostela in 2013 that killed 80 people was not part of the AVE network, although that train was travelling at high speed. Sunday's collision, however, took place on the oldest AVE route, that which connects Madrid with Andalusia. Several officials, including the president of Renfe, the national rail operator, Álvaro Fernández Heredia, said that human error was almost certainly not the cause of the accident, given that neither train was travelling at an excessive speed. Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska insisted that sabotage was not a possible cause. Inevitably, investigators are looking closely at the train that derailed. Owned by Italian firm Iryo, it was manufactured in 2022. Transport Minister Óscar Puente said that carriage number six of the train was going to be examined closely, because it was the first to derail and it offered "many pieces of the puzzle". However, investigators are also examining the section of track where the derailment occurred and intend to analyse parts of it in a laboratory. The revelation that part of the track at the crash site was broken has encouraged speculation that this might be the culprit. The government has been keen to play down such conclusions, pointing out that the track may have been damaged by the force of the collision. Some observers have drawn attention to possible underlying factors on the network. It has emerged that rail infrastructure administrator Adif drew attention to eight technical issues on the line near where the accident happened on social media over the last year. Most of those issues were related to signalling, and last summer one was discussed in the Senate. Adif has reduced the speed limit for the AVE along a 150-km (93-mile) stretch between Madrid and Barcelona, due to concerns about the state of the line. The new limit along that section is 160km/h, nearly half the previous limit. Since the collision, many social media users have flagged posts from the past in which they had complained about uncomfortable movement while travelling on AVE trains. One user filmed the interior of a train vigorously vibrating in December, commenting that it had caused them to "fear for my safety and that of my daughter". In August 2025, train drivers' union Semaf issued a communiqué warning that the state of a number of AVE lines was causing "a lack of comfort and reliability" for those travelling. It called for a reduction in speed limits in order to prevent further degradation of the infrastructure and "to guarantee the safety of workers and travellers". Such grievances might suggest that Spain's high-speed rail network is badly in need of an overhaul. However, the government counters that last year the section of track where the accident took place was renovated, at a cost of €49m (£42m), as part of a broader €700m investment to update the Madrid-Andalusia network in recent years. "When we find the answer, with absolute transparency we will make it known to Spaniards," Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, said of the investigation, as he declared three day's mourning during his visit to Adamuz. That answer could have enormous significance for the future of Spain's renowned rail system.
