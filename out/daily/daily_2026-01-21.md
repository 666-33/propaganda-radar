Trump says he has 'framework' of a Greenland deal as he drops Europe tariffs threat President Donald Trump has said he no longer plans to impose tariffs on European countries that had opposed his ambitions for the US to acquire Greenland. In a social media post, Trump said his decision followed a "very productive meeting" with Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte. "This solution, if consummated, will be a great one for the United States of America, and all Nato Nations," he wrote. Rutte has not confirmed the outcome. Earlier on Wednesday, Mr Trump told the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that he would not use military force but wanted immediate talks to secure ownership of the territory, which he insists is vital for US national security. Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said in a statement: "The day is ending on a better note than it began." He added: "Now, let's sit down and find out how we can address the American security concerns in the Arctic while respecting the red lines of the Kingdom of Denmark." Announcing his decision on Truth Social on Wednesday, Trump said more information would be made available "as discussions progress". He added that US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff would "report directly" to him as negotiations proceed. Trump provided no further details, raising questions about whether they had discussed a sale or lease, how a potential deal would address the security concerns he has consistently raised, and what Denmark, which controls the territory, thought of a potential agreement. In the hours that followed, some details began trickling out. Trump told CNBC the deal would last "forever" and could involve mineral rights and the planned Golden Dome missile defence system, which is envisioned as a shield of interceptors and detectors spanning land, sea and space to protect the US from long-range missile strikes. Along with Greenland's position on the globe, the Trump administration has spoken about its vast - and largely untapped - reserves of rare earth minerals, many of which are crucial for technologies including mobile phones and electric vehicles. After the post, Trump told CNN in Davos that the deal framework for Greenland was "pretty far along" and "gets us everything we needed to get", especially "real national security and international security". He did not say if the framework included American ownership of Greenland, though. Trump had previously dismissed the idea of leasing Greenland, saying that "you defend ownership. You don't defend leases." According to the New York Times, the plan would grant the US ownership of small pockets of the territory's land, where the US could build military bases. Officials who attended a Nato meeting about the issue on Wednesday told the newspaper the envisaged arrangement would be similar to UK bases on Cyprus, which are part of British Overseas Territories. Under existing agreements with Denmark, the US can bring as many troops as it wants to Greenland. It already has more than 100 military personnel permanently stationed at its Pituffik base in the north-western tip of the territory. Nato spokeswoman Allison Hart said in a statement that during the meeting Trump and Rutte had "discussed the critical significance of security in the Arctic region to all Allies, including the United States". "Negotiations between Denmark, Greenland, and the United States will go forward aimed at ensuring that Russia and China never gain a foothold - economically or militarily - in Greenland," she also said. Trump had said he was planning to place a 10% tariff "on any and all goods" sent from the UK to the US from 1 February, increasing to 25% from 1 June, until a deal was reached for Washington to purchase Greenland from Denmark. The same would apply to goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Finland – all of which are members of Nato, the defence alliance founded in 1949. In a speech to the World Economic Forum earlier on Wednesday, Trump had said he was "seeking immediate negotiations" to acquire Greenland, but insisted the US would not take the territory with force. "We probably won't get anything unless I decide to use excessive force. We'd be unstoppable, but we won't do that," Trump said on Wednesday. "I don't have to use force. I don't want to use force. I won't use force." He also urged world leaders to allow the US to take control of Greenland from Denmark, saying: "You can say yes and we will be very appreciative. Or you can say no and we will remember." But Trump suggested he would not be receptive to any agreements on the US use of Greenland that fall short of full ownership. In his own speech at Davos a day earlier, French President Emmanuel Macron criticised Trump's previous threat of tariffs, saying an "endless accumulation of new tariffs" from the US was "fundamentally unacceptable". Macron was among those urging the EU to consider retaliatory options against new US levies. In his speech, Trump took aim at Macron, saying France had been "screwing" the US for decades. The US president also took a swipe at Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who spoke at Davos on Tuesday, urging "middle powers" such as Australia, Argentina and his own country to band together, saying: "If we're not at the table, we're on the menu." In response, the US president accused Carney of being ungrateful to the US. "Canada lives because of the United States," Trump said. "Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements."

**Excerpt**

Faisal Islam: What it was like inside the room with Donald Trump at Davos I was in the room when President Donald Trump entered and it's fair to say he got a good welcome from the crowd, certainly at the beginning. A standing ovation. On top of that, there was an astonishing scrum to try to get in, with many turned away - even heads of state. The security was unbelievable, not letting even some of the most famous attendees in or out of the hall. Minutes into the speech, Trump was keeping his cool - even dropping in phrases about wanting the UK "to do great". What some thought would be the day on which the US president laid down the laws of his new global economy was filled more with grandfatherly advice. It was far from the mildly menacing tone of his social media posts claiming that Greenland will be America's. But which one is the real Donald Trump? Has he heard how badly some of his rhetoric has gone down? As I entered, I was told of an astonishing event last night where Trump's Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told the audience that, in terms of Europe's economy, "you're dead". There was a walkout. Might there have been one today? He seemed to be trying to avoid that. The Speech goes rather dark At first, I thought Trump was trying on a diplomatic front, perhaps having heard some of the significant criticism levelled against him and trying to sound mellow. He talked in friendly terms about the western allies that had been most perturbed by his social media posts. He even acknowledged that he probably shouldn't speak about the controversial issue of Greenland - which he has repeatedly vowed to take over. But, almost as though he could not help it, the speech seemed to take a dark turn. First he described America's role helping Greenland in the past, including being friendly to Denmark. But he then insulted Europe's biggest economy, saying everyone in the hall "would be speaking German" if it wasn't for the US. And then it came. He announced he was seeking immediate negotiations for the USA to acquire Greenland. A negotiated settlement, he said. No force required. But the US needed "full title". "We want this land" to build the "greatest Golden Dome ever built", he said. And he warned Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney about his words a day earlier, though stressing that he would also use Greenland to defend Canada. "I'm asking for a piece of ice... it's a very small ask." It was incredible to see this said out loud. Mixed reactions in the room There was high security, high stakes and high tension in the Alps for the arrival of the would-be sheriff of the world, brandishing his new rules. The reaction in the room ranged. The president's attempts at charm seemed to win him polite applause. But as he went from rigged elections to his annoyance at other leaders' Davos speeches, some sat in disbelief. Even though he promised not to invade Greenland, many were stunned by his attempts to persuade Europe to hand over the territory. Gavin Newsom, the Democratic governor of California said the speech was "TACO" Tuesday, a reference to the "Trump always chickens out" catchphrase used to mock the president. He argued Trump had backed down after robust pushback from leaders Emmanuel Macron and Mark Carney. A key Republican senator, Thomas Tillis, said the president's pursuit of Greenland, even a negotiated annexation, would not have the backing of Congress. So while Trump attempted to dial down tensions, he still criticised allies - including personal attacks on leaders. And while he promised not to invade Greenland, he still said it will be part of the new America - and that the world should thank him for it. The speech may have eventually come to an end, but we will be talking about it for a long time to come.

**Excerpt**

Trump's jibes are wearing thin for many of Europe's leaders "Without us, right now you'd all be speaking German," President Donald Trump told his audience at the World Economic Forum in the Swiss Alps on Wednesday. He may well have forgotten German is the most widely spoken of the four official languages in Switzerland. Many people – from Brussels to Berlin to Paris – will have found his speech to be insulting, overbearing and inaccurate. In it, he presented the idea that Europe is careering down the wrong path. That is a theme Trump has frequently explored, but it has a different impact when delivered on European soil to the faces of supposed friends and allies. There is undoubtedly huge relief across Europe that the US president ruled out the use of military force to take Greenland at the forum in Davos. But, even if he keeps his word, the fundamental problem remains that he wants a piece of land the owners say is not for sale. Despite this, after the forum, Trump posted on social media that he was dropping his latest tariff threat against eight European countries he had ruled most guilty of thwarting his Arctic ambitions. He claimed he had "formed the framework of a deal" for Greenland and the Arctic after a meeting with the Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte. It is not clear how this plan would meet Trump's stated desire to own the island outright. The proposed 10% taxes had been due to kick in from 1 February. "What is quite clear after this speech is that the president's ambition remains intact," Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen told reporters in Copenhagen - before Trump posted his climbdown. He said Trump's comments about the military were "positive in isolation". Thousands of miles from Davos in Nuuk, the Greenlandic capital, government officials unveiled a new brochure giving advice to residents about what to do if there were a "crisis" in the territory. Self-Sufficiency Minister Peter Borg said the document was "an insurance policy". He said Greenland's government did not expect to have to use it. Any hope in Europe that President Trump would take the sting out of this transatlantic crisis was smashed as he began to outline his uncompromising argument for taking the island. He ignored the European insistence that Greenland is sovereign EU territory and framed its acquisition as a perfectly reasonable transaction given the military support the US had provided the continent for decades. Trump insisted the US had been wrong to "give back" Greenland after securing it during World War Two. Greenland has never been part of the United States. Trump returned to his familiar refrain that the European members of Nato had done nothing for the US. He disparaged Denmark in particular when recalling how in 1940 it "fell to Germany after just six hours of fighting and was totally unable to defend either itself or Greenland". Trump's military history lesson failed to recall the Danes were a key partner of the US-led invasion of Afghanistan and paid a heavy price. Denmark lost 44 soldiers, proportionately more than any other ally apart from the US. They also lost personnel alongside US forces in Iraq. Many other Nato allies supported the US after the 9/11 attacks in 2001. It was French President Emmanuel Macron who was singled out for the most jibes. He was mocked for his appearance in sunglasses on Tuesday - he had an eye problem - and his "tough" talking at the podium. Trump insisted he liked Macron, before continuing: "Hard to believe, isn't it?" But the whole joke is wearing thin for many European leaders. They have spent a year trying to flatter, impress and appease the US president and in return have been presented with their biggest threat to date. The European Union meets on Thursday in Brussels for an emergency summit, with top European politicians having chosen to reach for their toughest language yet in response to US policy. Trump stepping back from the tariff threat that had galvanised EU countries will take a large degree of tension out of the meeting. But, they will want to know what exactly Trump and the Nato boss have concocted as a magic solution. They may now decide there is no longer a need to ramp up the rhetoric around counter-tariffs and on rolling out the EU's "trade bazooka". At the start of his one hour and 12 minute meandering address, President Trump boasted that at home "people are very happy with me". After this latest extraordinary round of Trump democracy, it is a sentiment much harder to find in the Europe the president claims to love so much.

Israeli strike in Gaza kills three journalists, first responders say Three Palestinian journalists have been killed in an Israeli strike in central Gaza, first responders say. Gaza's Hamas-run Civil Defence agency said their car was hit in the al-Zahra area and named them as Mohammed Salah Qashta, Anas Ghneim and Abdul Raouf Shaat. They are understood to have been working for an Egyptian relief organisation. The Israeli military said it struck "several suspects who operated a drone affiliated with Hamas... in a manner that posed a threat" to its troops. It added that the incident was under examination. Another eight people, two of them children, were killed by Israeli artillery and gunfire across Gaza on Wednesday, the Hamas-run health ministry said. Medics said three people, including a 10-year-old boy, were killed by Israeli tank fire elsewhere in central Gaza, and that a 13-year-old boy and a woman were killed by Israeli gunfire in the southern Khan Younis area, according to Reuters news agency. The Israeli military said on Wednesday morning that its troops had killed a "terrorist who crossed the Yellow Line and approached" them, without mentioning a location. The Yellow Line demarcates territory in Gaza still under Israeli control under the ceasefire deal. At least 466 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas began on 10 October, according to the health ministry. The Israeli military has said three of its soldiers have been killed in attacks by Palestinian armed groups over the same period. The three photojournalists killed on Wednesday were reportedly working for the Egyptian Relief Committee in the Gaza Strip to film its camps for displaced people. A spokesperson for the humanitarian organisation said the car that was struck was marked with its logo and that it was "targeted during a humanitarian mission, resulting in the martyrdom of three individuals". Hamas called the strike a "dangerous escalation of the flagrant violations of the ceasefire agreement". The Palestinian Journalists Syndicate said it constituted a war crime and evidence of what it called "a systematic Israeli policy aimed at silencing the Palestinian voice, obstructing the transmission of facts, and concealing crimes committed against civilians", according to Palestinian news agency Wafa. Abdul Raouf Shaat was regular contributor to French news agency AFP, which expressed "immense sadness" at his death and demanded a "full and transparent investigation". The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) also said it was "appalled". "Israel, which possesses advanced technology capable of identifying its targets, has an obligation under international law to protect journalists," regional director Sara Qudah said. The CPJ has documented the killing of at least 206 journalists and media workers by Israeli fire in Gaza since the start of the war - the deadliest conflict for journalists ever documented. Before Wednesday, two journalists had been killed in Israeli strikes during the ceasefire, and a third had been killed by members of a Palestinian armed group, according to the US-based organisation's data. International news outlets, including the BBC, rely on local journalists in Gaza, as Israel does not allow them to send foreign journalists into the territory independently. Some journalists are taken into Gaza by the Israeli military under controlled access. The war was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. Israel responded to the attack by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 71,550 people have been killed, according to the territory's health ministry.

**Excerpt**

Oldest cave painting of red claw hand could rewrite human creativity timeline A stencilled outline of a hand found on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi is the world's oldest known cave painting, researchers say. It shows a red outline of a hand whose fingers were reworked, researchers say, to create a claw-like motif which indicates an early leap in symbolic imagination. The painting has been dated to at least 67,800 years ago – around 1,100 years before the previous record, a controversial hand stencil in Spain. The find also strengthens the argument that our species, Homo sapiens, had reached the wider Australia–New Guinea landmass, known as Sahul, by around 15,000 years earlier than some researchers argue. Over the past decade, a series of discoveries on Sulawesi has overturned the old idea that art and abstract thinking in our species burst suddenly into life in Ice Age Europe and spread from there. Cave art is seen as a key marker of when humans began to think in truly abstract, symbolic ways – the kind of imagination that underpins language, religion and science. Early paintings and engravings show people not just reacting to the world, but representing it, sharing stories and identities in a way no other species is known to have done. Professor Adam Brumm of Griffiths University in Australia, who co-led the project, told BBC News, that the latest discovery, published in the journal Nature, adds to the emerging view that there was no awakening for humanity in Europe. Instead, creativity was innate to our species, the evidence for which stretches back to Africa, where we evolved. "When I went to university in the mid to late 90s, that's what we were taught – the creative explosion in humans occurred in a small part of Europe. But now we're seeing traits of modern human behaviour, including narrative art in Indonesia, which makes that Eurocentric argument very hard to sustain". The oldest Spanish cave art is a red hand stencil in Maltravieso cave in Western Spain, dated to be at least 66,700 years old - though this is controversial and some experts don't think it to be that old. In 2014, hand stencils and animal figures dating back at least 40,000 years were found in Sulawesi, followed by a hunting scene that is at least 44,000 year old, and then a narrative pig and human painting dated to at least 51,200 years ago. Each step pushed sophisticated image making further back in time, according to Professor Maxime Aubert of Griffiths University. "We started with minimum ages of at least 40,000 years, the same time as in Europe, but by getting closer to the pigment we've pushed the rock art in Sulawesi back by at least another 28,000 years". The latest discovery is from a limestone cave called Liang Metanduno on Muna, a small island off south eastern Sulawesi. It has been spray-painted: an ancient graffiti artist pressed their hand flat against the cave wall, then blew or spat a mouthful of pigment around it so that, when they pulled the hand away, a negative outline was left behind on the rock. One fragmentary hand stencil there is overlain by thin mineral crusts that, when analysed, was found to have a minimum age of 67,800 years, making it the oldest reliably dated cave art anywhere in the world. Crucially, the artist did more than simply spray pigment around a hand pressed to the wall, the researchers say. After the original stencil was made, the outlines of the fingers were carefully altered – narrowed and elongated to make it look more claw-like; a creative transformation that Brumm argues is "a very us thing to do". He notes that there was no evidence of that experimentation in any of the art produced by our sister species, Neanderthals, in their cave paintings in Spain around 64,000 years ago. Even that is hotly contested because some researchers question the dating method. Until this latest discovery on Muna, all the paintings in Sulawesi had come from the Maros Pangkep karst in the island's south west. The fact that this much older stencil turns up on the opposite side of Sulawesi, on a separate satellite island, suggests that making images on cave walls was not a local experiment but deeply embedded in the cultures that spread across the region. Brumm says years of fieldwork by Indonesian colleagues have revealed "hundreds of new rock art sites" across remote areas, with some caves used repeatedly over tens of thousands of years. At Liang Metanduno, other, much younger paintings on the same panel – some produced as late as about 20,000 years ago – show that this single cave was a focus for artistic activity stretching over at least 35,000 years. Because Sulawesi lies on the northern sea route between mainland Asia and ancient Sahul, the dates have direct implications for assessing when the ancestors of Aboriginal Australians first arrived. For years, the mainstream view – based largely on DNA studies and most archaeological sites – was that Homo sapiens first reached the ancient Australia–New Guinea landmass, Sahul, about 50,000 years ago. But with firm evidence that Homo sapiens were settled on Sulawesi and making complex symbolic art at least 67,800 years ago, it makes it much more likely that controversial archaeological evidence for humans in northern Australia by about 65,000 years is correct, according to Adhi Agus Oktaviana, of the Indonesia's national research and innovation Agency (BRIN). "It is very likely that the people who made these paintings in Sulawesi were part of the broader population that would later spread through the region and ultimately reach Australia." Many archaeologists once argued for a European "big bang" of the mind because cave paintings, carvings, ornaments and new stone tools all seem to appear together in France and Spain about 40,000 years ago, soon after Homo sapiens arrived there. Spectacular Ice Age cave art in places like Altamira and El Castillo encouraged the idea that symbolism and art switched on almost overnight in Ice Age Europe. Since then, engraved ochre, beads and abstract marks from South African sites such as Blombos Cave, some 70,000–100,000 years old, have shown that symbolic behaviour was already established in Africa long before. Along with very old figurative and narrative paintings from Sulawesi, a new consensus is being shaped; that there was a much deeper and more widespread story of creativity, Aubert told BBC News. "What it suggests is that humans would have had that capacity for a very long time, at least when they left Africa – but probably before that".

US to transfer Islamic State prisoners from Syria to Iraq The US military has begun the transfer up to 7,000 Islamic State (IS) group detainees from prisons in north-eastern Syria to Iraq, as Syria's new government takes control of areas long run autonomously by Kurdish-led forces. US Central Command (Centcom) said it had already moved 150 IS fighters from Hassakeh province to a "secure location" in Iraq. It said the move aimed to prevent prisoners breaking out and regrouping. The transfer follows a ceasefire agreement that has brought much of Syria's north east under Damascus control, after the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) withdrew from key areas, including detention sites holding thousands of IS suspects and their relatives. CENTCOM said its commander Admiral Brad Cooper discussed the transfers with Syria's new president Ahmed al-Sharaa, stressing the need for Syrian forces to uphold the ceasefire and avoid any action that could interfere with what he described as an "orderly and secure transfer" of detainees. Rights group Reprieve warned that detainees transferred to Iraq could face torture and execution and urged the UK government to establish whether any British nationals were among those being moved. The charity said it believed there were no more than 10 British men held in the prisons, though exact numbers were unclear. Around 55 to 60 British nationals, most of them children, remain detained across camps and prisons in the region, it said. Despite the ceasefire there have been fresh clashes, with Syria's defence ministry saying seven soldiers were killed in a drone attack in Hassakeh on Wednesday, describing the incident a violation of the ceasefire. The SDF denied carrying out the strike and accused Damascus of also launching attacks, including near the town of Kobane on the Turkish border. The government and SDF had earlier blamed each other over the escape of suspected IS fighters from an SDF-run prison in Shaddadi, in southern Hassakeh. Syria's interior ministry said on Monday night that its special forces and army soldiers had entered the town following "the escape of around 120 [IS] terrorists" from the prison. It said security forces later recaptured 81 of the fugitives. The SDF said it had lost control of the prison following clashes with "Damascus-affiliated factions", warning of a "serious security catastrophe". SDF spokesman Farhad Shami said around 1,500 IS members may have escaped during the clashes, according to Reuters news agency. The SDF also accused government forces of attacking al-Aqtan prison, north of the city of Raqqa, which is also holding IS members and leaders. The SDF helped US-led forces defeat IS during Syria's 13-year civil war and, backed by the US, went on to jail around 12,000 IS members, including thousands of foreigners, while detaining tens of thousands of relatives in camps across the north east. However US special envoy Tom Barrack has said the US alliance with the SDF had "largely expired" and that his country was currently focused on securing IS detention facilities and facilitating talks between the SDF and al-Sharaa's government. "This moment offers a pathway to full integration into a unified Syrian state with citizenship rights, cultural protections, and political participation - long denied under Bashar al-Assad's regime," he wrote on X.

Ghislaine Maxwell to testify before US Congress in Epstein probe Ghislaine Maxwell, the jailed associate of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, has agreed to testify under oath before the congressional committee investigating the federal government's handling of the Epstein cases. Committee chairman James Comer, who is leading the investigation, says Maxwell will depose virtually on 9 February. Maxwell's legal team has previously said she would decline to answer questions under her constitutional right to remain silent unless she is granted legal immunity. Comer, previewing the deposition, said, "her lawyers have been saying she is going to plead the Fifth," referring to the US Fifth Amendment right to decline to speak to authorities. The announcement from the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee comes as the Trump administration continues to come under fierce scrutiny for its handling of the Epstein case. Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for recruiting and trafficking teenage girls for sexual abuse by Epstein. In July, the committee declined to offer Maxwell legal immunity in exchange for her testimony. In August, the committee issued legal summons to Maxwell, requiring her to submit evidence under oath. Maxwell's legal team said that requiring her to both testify from jail, and without any legal immunity, were "non-starters". The lawyers said she "cannot risk further criminal exposure in a politically charged environment without formal immunity" as speaking from prison "creates real security risks and undermines the integrity of the process". House lawmakers cannot force Maxwell to waive her Fifth Amendment protections. On Tuesday, Maxwell's legal team said in a letter to the committee that she would continue to refuse to testify. "Put plainly, proceeding under these circumstances would serve no other purpose than pure political theater and a complete waste of taxpayer monies," the attorneys wrote. "The Committee would obtain no testimony, no answers, and no new facts." Maxwell, who was convicted in 2021, had appealed against the conviction to the Supreme Court last October but the top court declined to hear the former British socialite's appeal. Her only route to leave prison early would be a presidential pardon, unless she is able to persuade a federal judge in New York to vacate or amend her sentence. The White House has denied that Trump is considering granting her clemency, however, Trump has also said he has not ruled it out. Separately, the Department of Justice faced a deadline of 19 December last year to release all remaining Epstein files in their possession. So far only a fraction of them have been made public. The department has faced criticism from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle over the number of redactions in the files, which the law permits only to protect victims' identities and active criminal investigations. Meanwhile, the House committee is also meeting to discuss former President Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary Clinton's refusal to appear before the panel to answer questions related to the investigation into Epstein. The committee has said it is considering filing contempt charges against the two.

**Excerpt**

Israel postpones demolition of Palestinian children's football pitch Israel has postponed the demolition of a Palestinian children's football club in the city of Bethlehem, in the occupied West Bank. It said the Aida Youth Centre's pitch was constructed without the necessary permits. It said the demolition was necessary for security reasons. An international campaign to save it, including a petition with more than half a million signatures, appears to have forced the authorities to reconsider. The club, however, said it had not yet received any official notification. It is barely a 10th of the size of a full-scale football field, there are patches of rust on the goalposts and, towering over the length of one of the touchlines, the architecture of conflict looms large in Israel's concrete security barrier. But while it may not rank high up among the world's iconic sporting venues, this children's football club has found itself at the centre of a hard-fought international campaign for its survival. And despite the asymmetrical odds as it took on the Israeli state, that campaign appears - for now at least - to have worked. The club has won a reprieve against the threat of demolition by the Israeli military, which claimed that the pitch was far too close to the barrier. On the very northern edge of Bethlehem, construction of the pitch began in 2020 with the aim of providing a place to practise football for more than 200 young players from the nearby Aida refugee camp. The cramped and crowded streets contain the homes of the descendants of Palestinian families who were forced or who fled from their homes during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. On 3 November last year, as the children made their short walk from the camp for that day's training, they found a notice pinned to the gate of the football field declaring it to be illegal. The notice was followed by a demolition order, issued at the end of December. "We don't have anywhere else to play, 10-year-old Naya told me, wearing a Brazil shirt with the name of the footballing legend Neymar emblazoned on the back. "We are building our dreams here," she said. "If they demolish our field, they will demolish our dreams." I asked another young player, Mohammed, what his reaction was when he heard the news that the club was earmarked for destruction. "I was upset," he told me. "This is a field I really care for." The community fought back, posting videos on social media, launching a petition attracting hundreds of thousands of signatures as well as the reported interventions of senior officials from some of football's global and regional governing bodies. In its latest statement, the Israeli military repeated its claim that the football pitch, built so close to the wall, posed a security issue. But the BBC understands that a political decision has been made to postpone the demolition order "for the time being". Israel began building its concrete barrier in the early 2000s in the face of a wave of deadly suicide bombings and other attacks carried out by Palestinians which killed hundreds of Israelis. It says it is vital for Israel's protection and that it has dramatically cut the number of attacks. Palestinians, however, say that it has become a tool of collective punishment, separating them from their workplaces, dividing their communities and effectively annexing parts of their land. For them, the fight over the football pitch highlights a wider injustice. While they are being denied the right to keep a small sporting facility on the boundary of one of their cities, Israel is approving vast new settlements across the occupied West Bank and which are considered illegal under international law. The immediate threat may now have been averted for the football pitch. But the club is taking nothing for granted. Mohammad Abu Srour, one of the board members of the Aida Youth Centre, told me that they feared that the threat might come back when the club is out of the spotlight. "We're going to continue to campaign," he told me.

Supreme Court sceptical of Trump firing of Lisa Cook US President Donald Trump appeared on course for a setback at America's top court on Wednesday over his unprecedented move to fire a central bank governor. Supreme Court justices from the left and right asked why they should speed through such an impactful decision, citing concerns about process and implications for central bank independence and the wider economy. Trump in August said he was removing Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook, accusing her of engaging in mortgage fraud, which she has denied. Cook has argued she did not receive due process to dispute those claims, which Fed defenders say were a pretext to allow Trump to assert more control over the bank. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a conservative who was appointed by Trump, was among the justices to express sympathy with Cook's arguments, asking: "What's the fear of more process here?" He later warned the administration's interpretation of the law would "weaken, if not shatter, the independence of the Federal Reserve". 'Quite a big mistake' By law, a president can only remove governors of the Federal Reserve "for cause". That requirement was intended to shield the central bank from political pressure and allow it to make policy independently. The White House contends it has met that bar, accusing Cook of filing mortgage forms claiming two different principal residences at the same time. Banks typically offer lower interest rates for primary homes. The Trump administration has asked the court to allow the president to remove Cook, a move lower courts had blocked while the case played out. "Even if it's inadvertent or a mistake, it's quite a big mistake," said solicitor general D John Sauer, who was arguing the case for the administration. He said such conduct could undermine confidence in the bank and that courts were bound to defer to the president's judgement when it comes to finding a cause. He dismissed questions about process, noting that Trump had alerted Cook to the issue on social media before formally firing her. "There was a social media post," he said. "And the response was defiance." 'Nothing criminal whatsoever' Cook has denied committing fraud. In a November letter to the Justice Department, her lawyers said the claims were based on "cherry-picked, incomplete snippets of the full documents". They said there was "one stray reference to primary residence" in a mortgage application for an apartment in Alabama, but noted that the file also contained "truthful and more specific disclosures about the property's use". "There is no fraud, no intent to deceive, nothing whatsoever criminal or remotely a basis to allege mortgage fraud," her lawyers wrote. Arguing on behalf of Cook, Paul Clement said people in her position should have the chance to present their evidence and be shielded from having a decision made in advance. He said the administration's interpretation of the law would make the protection that Congress intended by inserting the "for cause" requirement "toothless". Some justices indicated that they shared those concerns. The "position that there's no judicial review, no process required, no remedy available, very low bar for cause that the president alone determines - that would weaken if not shatter the independence of the Federal Reserve," Kavanaugh said. The lawsuit is seen as high stakes, given swirling debate about Trump's efforts to influence the Fed, which he wants to lower interest rates more aggressively to boost economic growth. Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell was among the officials expected to attend. He is facing his own criminal probe related to cost overruns during renovations of Fed properties - concerns he has called "pretexts". In other recent cases, the Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has allowed the White House to proceed with firings. But it has signalled that it views the Federal Reserve, which was designed to set policy independently from the White House, as different. In a statement after the hearing, Cook's lawyers said they were "hopeful" the court would recognise the importance of the Fed being able to operate free from political interference. In her own statement, Cook, who attended the hearing, said: "This case is about whether the Federal Reserve will set key interest rates guided by evidence and independent judgment or will succumb to political pressure. "For as long as I serve at the Federal Reserve, I will uphold the principle of political independence in service to the American people." Several justices, including conservatives, indicated they were hesitant to greenlight Cook's removal without courts having resolved issues like whether the mortgage filings, which were made before Cook was appointed, would meet the bar for a "for cause" firing. "We know that the independence of the agency is very important and that that independence is harmed if we decide these issues too quickly and without due consideration," said Justice Sonia Sotomayor, a liberal. "So to me, waiting to have at least the lower courts look at these issues first makes the most sense." "Is there any reason why this whole matter had to be handled by everybody... in such a hurried manner?" asked Justice Samuel Alito, a conservative. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, another Trump appointee, pressed Sauer to explain what harm the president would suffer by waiting, noting that the court had been warned of potentially dire economic consequences of a decision that could weaken belief in the central bank's independence. "There's a risk," she said. "Doesn't that counsel... caution on our part?"

Taylor Swift makes history as she joins Songwriters Hall of Fame Taylor Swift has become the youngest female artist inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. It follows a glittering few years for the 36-year-old pop superstar, who broke her own sales record with her latest album, The Life of a Showgirl, in October. She is among nine songwriters within the 2026 class, which also includes Canadian-American singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette and Walter Afanasieff, known for his work with Mariah Carey. The singer will be welcomed into the prestigious club during a private ceremony in New York later this year. 'Everything originates from the song and its creator' Founded in 1969, the Songwriters Hall of Fame honours those "whose work represents a spectrum of the most beloved songs from the world's popular music songbook". It selects a small group of artists on an annual basis, and less than 500 people have been invited in over the last fifty years. Announcing this year's inductees, chairman and Chic frontman Nile Rodgers said this year's line-up "not only showcases iconic songs but also celebrates unity across various genres". "These songwriters have profoundly impacted the lives of billions of listeners worldwide, and it is our privilege to honor their contributions," he added. Also among the 2026 class is Christopher "Tricky" Stewart, who was behind Beyonce's Single Ladies and Break My Soul, and Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons of rock band Kiss. Footloose singer-songwriter Kenny Loggins and Terry Britten and Graham Lyle, who wrote Tina Turner's What's Love Got To Do With It, have also been inducted. Taylor is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, reaching stardom with her 12 studio albums and four re-recorded "Taylor's Versions" albums. Last year, it was announced she had bought back the rights to her first six albums, ending a long-running and highly publicized battle over the ownership of her music. While her latest album secured the UK's biggest opening week of 2025, after selling 304,000 copies in just three days. She has been decorated with a host of awards over the years, including becoming the first performer to win the album of the year Grammy four times.

### 11. [Japan restarts world's largest nuclear plant as Fukushima memories loom large](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq6v0v32rg1o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

Japan restarts world's largest nuclear plant as Fukushima memories loom large Japan has restarted operations at the world's largest nuclear power plant for the first time since the 2011 Fukushima disaster forced the country to shut all of its reactors. The decision to restart reactor number 6 at Kashiwazaki-Kariwa north-west of Tokyo was taken despite local residents' safety concerns. It was delayed by a day because of an alarm malfunction and is due to begin operating commercially next month. Heavily reliant on energy imports, Japan was an early adopter of nuclear power. But in 2011 all 54 of Japan's reactors had to be shut after the most powerful earthquake it had ever recorded triggered a meltdown at Fukushima, causing one of the worst nuclear disasters in history. This is the latest installment in Japan's nuclear power reboot, which still has a long way to go. The seventh reactor at Kashiwazaki-Kariwa is not expected to be brought back on until 2030, and the other five could be decommissioned. That leaves the plant with far less capacity than it once had when all seven reactors were operational: 8.2 gigawatts. The meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi, 220km (135 miles) north-east of Tokyo on the coast, led to radioactive leakage. Local communities were evacuated, and many have not returned despite official assurances that it was safe to do so. Critics say the plant's owner Tokyo Electric Power Company, or Tepco, was not prepared, and the response from them and government was not well co-ordinated. An independent government report called it a "man-made disaster" and blamed Tepco, although a court later cleared three of their executives of negligence. Still the fear and lack of trust fuelled public opposition to nuclear power and Japan suspended all of its reactors. It has now spent the past decade trying to wake up those power plants, as it seeks to reach net zero emissions by 2050. Since 2015, Japan has restarted 15 out of its 33 operable reactors. The Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant is the first of those owned by Tepco to be turned back on. Before 2011, nuclear power accounted for nearly 30% of Japan's electricity and the country planned to get that up to 50% by 2030. Its energy plan last year unveiled a tamer goal: it wants nuclear power to provide 20% of its electricity needs by 2040. Even that may be tricky. 'A drop on a hot stone' Global momentum is building around nuclear energy, with the International Atomic Energy Agency estimating that the world's nuclear power capacity could more than double by 2050. In Japan, as of 2023, nuclear power accounted for just 8.5% of electricity. Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, who took office in October, has emphasised the importance of nuclear power for Japan's energy self-sufficiency. Especially as it expects energy demand to surge because of data centres and semiconductor manufacturing. Japan's leaders and its energy companies have long pushed for nuclear power. They say it's more reliable than renewable energy like solar and wind, and better suited for Japan's mountainous terrain. But critics say the emphasis on nuclear energy has come at the cost of investing in renewables and cutting emissions. Now, as Japan tries to revive its nuclear power ambitions, the costs of running the reactors have surged, partly because of new safety checks that require hefty investments from companies trying to restart plants. "Nuclear power is getting much more expensive than they ever thought it would," says Dr Florentine Koppenborg, a senior researcher at the Technical University of Munich. The government could subsidise the costs, or pass them on to consumers - both unpalatable options for Japan's leaders, who have for decades been hailing the affordability of nuclear power. An expensive energy bill could also hurt the government at a time when households are protesting about rising costs. The government's "hands are tied when it comes to financially supporting nuclear power, unless it's willing to go back on one of the main selling points", Koppenborg says. "I think [Japan's nuclear power revival] is a drop on a hot stone, because it does not change the larger picture of nuclear power decline in Japan." Beyond the fear of another disaster like Fuksuhima, a series of scandals has also rattled public trust. The Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant in particular found itself embroiled in a couple of them. In 2023, one of its employees lost a stack of documents after placing it on top of their car and forgetting it was there before driving away. In November, another was found to have mishandled confidential documents. A Tepco spokesperson said the company reported the incidents to the Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA), adding that it aimed to continue improving security management. These revelations are "a good sign" for transparency, says Koppenborg. But they also reveal that "Tepco is struggling to change its ways [and] the way it approaches safety". Earlier this month, the NRA suspended its review to restart nuclear reactors at Chubu Electric's Hamaoka plant in central Japan, after the company was found to have manipulated quake data in its tests. The company apologised, saying: "We will continue to respond sincerely, and to the fullest extent possible, to the instructions and guidance of the NRA." Hisanori Nei, a former senior nuclear safety official, tells the BBC, while he was "surprised" by the scandal at Hamaoka, he believed the harsh penalty handed to its operator should deter other companies from doing the same. "Power companies should recognise the importance not to [falsify data]," he said, adding that authorities will "reject and punish" offending companies. Surviving another Fukushima What happened at Fukushima turned Japanese public opinion against what had been hailed as an affordable and sustainable form of energy. Thousands of residents filed class action lawsuits against Tepco and the Japanese government, demanding compensation for property damage, emotional distress and health problems allegedly linked to radiation exposure. In the weeks after the March 2011 disaster, 44% of Japanese thought the use of nuclear power should be reduced, according to a survey by Pew Research Center. That figure jumped to 70% by 2012. But then polls by the Japanese business publication Nikkei in 2022 showed that more than 50% of people supported nuclear power if safety was ensured. But there is still fear and mistrust. In 2023, the release of treated radioactive water from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant sparked anxiety and anger both at home and abroad. And many remain opposed to restarting nuclear plants. In December, hundreds of protesters gathered outside the Niigata prefectural assembly where Kashiwazaki-Kariwa is located, voicing safety concerns. "If something was to happen at the plant, we would be the ones to suffer the consequences," one protester told Reuters news agency. Last week, ahead of Kashiwazaki-Kariwa's restart, a small crowd gathered in front of Tepco's headquarters to protest again. Nuclear safety standards have been ramped up after Fukushima. The NRA, a cabinet body established in 2012, now oversees the restarting of the country's nuclear plants. At Kashiwazaki-Kariwa, 15-metre-high (49-foot) seawalls have been built to guard against large tsunamis; watertight doors now protect critical equipment at the facility. "Based on the new safety standards, [Japan's nuclear plants] could survive even a similar earthquake and tsunami like the one we had in 2011," says Nei, the former senior nuclear safety official. But what worries Koppenborg is: "They're preparing for the worst they've seen in the past but not for what is to come." Some experts worry that these policies are not planning enough to account for rising sea levels due to climate change, or the once-in-a-century megaquake that Japan has been anticipating. "If the past repeats itself, Japan is super well-prepared," Koppenborg says. "If something really unexpected happens and a bigger than expected tsunami comes along, we don't know."

Train driver killed in second deadly Spain rail crash in days A train driver has been killed and at least 37 people injured, five seriously, after a commuter train derailed and crashed near Barcelona two days after a deadly two-train collision in southern Spain. According to local officials, the Rodalies train collided with a retaining wall which fell on to the track between Gelida and Sant Sadurní. Catalonia regional fire Inspector Claudi Gallardo said all the passengers had been removed from the train. The incident occurred as heavy storms battered north-eastern Spain, with coastal areas in the east and north-west of Spain on high alert because of the weather. Rail officials believe the wall collapsed as the train was passing shortly after 21:00 (20:00 GMT) on Tuesday evening, striking the driver's cab first and then causing considerable damage to the first carriage of the train in which most of the injured passengers were travelling. The identity of the driver was not immediately clear as three trainees had been with the driver when the accident happened. Firefighters said two of them were among those seriously injured. It took almost an hour to free one of the survivors at the scene in Gelida, about 35km (22 miles) west of Barcelona. Emergency services said they had evacuated some of the injured to nearby Moisès Broggi, Bellvitge, and Vilafranca hospitals. Services across Catalonia's main Rodalies commuter rail network have been suspended completely while safety checks are carried out and officials say they will not resume until lines are considered safe. Spanish train drivers' union Semaf has called a strike as a result of the two deadly crashes, at Gelida on Tuesday and near Córdoba in Andalusia where at least 43 people died. Two high-speed trains collided at Adamuz, Andalusia, on Sunday in one of the worst Spanish rail accidents in over a decade. Carriages on a Madrid-bound train derailed and crossed over to the opposite tracks and then collided with an oncoming high-speed train. "All members of Semaf are devastated and consider this situation of constant deterioration of the railway unacceptable," the union said in a statement. Local officials in Catalonia believe heavy rain after months of drought is to blame for the collapse of the wall. Meanwhile, another train on the Barcelona commuter network also derailed on Tuesday. "The axle was struck by a rock dislodged by the storm," Spain's rail network operator Adif said in a statement. The train was running between Blanes and Maçanet-Massanes, north-east of Barcelona and reportedly carrying about 10 passengers. As a result of the suspension of services across the entire Rodalies network in Catalonia some 400,000 commuters are expected to be affected, according to Spanish newspaper El País.

**Excerpt**

Blake Lively called Justin Baldoni 'a clown' in text messages Blake Lively referred to Justin Baldoni as a "doofus director" and a "clown", according to newly unsealed court documents from the actress's legal case. The pair starred together in It Ends With Us, but Lively sued Baldoni in December 2024, accusing him of sexual harassment and waging a smear campaign against her. Baldoni strongly denies the claims and is defending the lawsuit. Text messages from 2023 between Lively and people close to her appear to show that Lively called Baldoni a "rabid pig", while her friend Taylor Swift suggested Baldoni knew the lawsuit was coming "because he's gotten out his tiny violin". Baldoni's $400m (£295m) counter-suit was dismissed by a judge last June. Neither has yet responded to the BBC's request for comment. Lively's case is set to go to trial in May. The newly unsealed documents show both Lively and Baldoni venting to friends and colleagues about filming It Ends With Us, and the subsequent press tour, ahead of the film's release in August 2024. In the messages, Lively referred to Baldoni as "this doofus director of my movie" and described him as "a clown" who "thinks he's a writer now". In their filing earlier this week, Lively's team did not deny the language she had used but said the text messages were missing context. They referred the court to the "complete" text exchange, including subsequent messages from Lively to Baldoni which said "we all benefit" from her relationship with Swift and her husband Ryan Reynolds, and "you will too, I can promise you". The messages also show Lively saying of Baldoni: "Despite his repeated disturbing behaviour and acts, I still feel bad for him. "To be reminded multiple times daily that he's smearing me for... asking him not to sexually or emotionally harass me? For making his movie better? For calling in all the favours to turn out all the biggest musicians and entertainers to contribute to making his movie better? For leading a marketing campaign for free?" She continued: "I literally don't know a single thing I've done that he can smear me about. Ryan [Reynolds] says [Baldoni] should be writing me apology and thank you letters every day. And instead he chooses to make a monster outta me. "But what's my crime. I've only ever stayed focused on the work and given him every opportunity to make it better. And he just keeps behaving like a rabid pig." The messages also appear to show Lively texted Baldoni's former The Man Enough Podcast co-host, Liz Plank in May 2023, and told her that "today I came home and cried" following an "SOS set visit". Plank responded by saying that she "thought maybe things had gotten better", and that it was "astounding they have gotten away with so much". It is unclear who "they" refers to. The documents note that Plank recalled working on Baldoni's set as "truly one of the worst days of [her] life". Later that year, Lively also sent texts to actress and co-star Jenny Slate, and said she was "dreading" going back to set and "getting hits of the experience in really upsetting ways". In her deposition, Slate also alleged misconduct on the set of the film, with court documents revealing that she had made complaints against Baldoni and producer Jamey Heath during the course of filming It Ends With Us. Similarly, texts sent by Baldoni also suggest friction between him and Lively. In February 2024, Baldoni told Heath that he was concerned that Lively would use the allegations she had made against him as leverage. He wrote: "She had the nuclear bomb. If she doesn't promote the movie she can leak that I'm a bad person or that she felt unsafe with me and 'all the stuff' she has on me. Then she's the victim." Heath is the CEO of Wayfarer Studios, the independent production company behind It Ends With Us, which is named in Lively's lawsuit. Her legal filing accuses Baldoni and Heath of "repeated sexual harassment and other disturbing behaviour", in addition to a hostile working environment. The text messages were unsealed on Tuesday before a summary judgement hearing in Lively's ongoing lawsuit that is scheduled for 22 January. The BBC has contacted Lively and Baldoni's respective legal teams for comment.

**Excerpt**

Fact-checking Trump's Davos speech In a free-wheeling speech to world leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, President Trump made a series of contested claims. Trump touched on his desire to obtain Greenland from Denmark - which he referred to as a "small ask", America's contribution to Nato, and wind energy in China. His address - which lasted for more than an hour - contained a number of false assertions which BBC Verify has been looking at. Did the US 'give Greenland back' after World War Two? For weeks, Trump has spoken about his desire to acquire Greenland, a largely self-governing territory of Denmark. He has said it is critical to US national security. At Davos, he said that after World War Two "we gave Greenland back to Denmark," adding: "How stupid were we to do that?" But it was not America's to give back. In 1933 an international court - a predecessor to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) - ruled that Greenland belonged to Denmark. In 1941 - following Denmark's surrender to Germany the previous year - the US and Danish representatives signed an agreement allowing the US to defend Greenland to prevent the Nazis from taking it over. This led to the construction of US bases on the island as well as the deployment of US troops. However, the agreement did not involve a transfer of sovereignty, meaning Greenland never became US territory. Is the US paying for 'virtually 100%' of Nato's defence? The US president criticised Nato and claimed that "the United States was paying for virtually 100% of Nato". He said of the level of contributions from countries which are members of the military alliance: "They didn't pay the 2% and now they're paying the 5%". Neither of these claims are correct. In recent years US spending on defence accounted for about 70% of the total spent by Nato countries. In 2024, that went down to 65% and, in 2025, it is estimated to have been 62%, as all Nato members were set to have spent at least 2% of their GDP on defence for the first time. The US president has got these countries to commit to spending more on defence but the 5% that Trump is talking about is a long-term aim - to be achieved by 2035. Currently, no Nato member spends that much, as even Poland – the country spending the most of its GDP on defence – is estimated to have spent just below 4.5% in 2025. Has the US got nothing back from Nato? Trump claimed that the US had "never gotten anything" from Nato and "we've never asked for anything". The Nato website states that "collective defence is NATO's most fundamental principle" and Article 5 of its founding treaty states that "an armed attack against one NATO member shall be considered an attack against them all". The US is the only member of the alliance to invoke Article 5, doing so in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. Nato nations contributed troops and military equipment to the US-led war in Afghanistan which followed. Among the countries that contributed was Denmark, which suffered among the highest per capita casualty rates of the US allies. They were largely deployed to heavily contested areas alongside British forces in Helmand province. Does China have no wind farms? Trump also criticised wind energy - a familiar target which he said was part of a "new green scam". He singled out China, claiming that although it made lots of wind turbines, he had not "been able to find any wind farms in China." China has one of the largest wind farms in the world at Gansu, which can be seen from space. China generates more wind energy than any other country, according to Our World in Data. Its statistics show that in 2024 China generated 997 terawatt-hours from wind. That was more than double that of the US - which was in second place. Does the UK take 92% of North Sea oil revenue? President Trump also singled out the UK, criticising its energy policies. Referring to North Sea oil, Trump incorrectly said: "They [the UK] make it impossible for the oil companies to go, they take 92% of the revenues." Oil and gas firms operating in the North Sea pay a 30% corporation tax on their profits and a supplementary 10% rate on top of that. This is higher than the 25% corporation tax paid by other large companies. In November 2024, the government raised the windfall tax on oil and gas companies from 35% to 38%. That takes the total tax on North Sea Oil to 78%, which is paid on profits not revenue. The windfall tax, which was introduced by the Conservatives in 2022 as a response to rising energy bills, is due to expire in 2030. Has Trump secured $18tn worth of investments for the US? President Trump also spoke about the investments his administration had secured for America. He said, "we've secured commitments for a record-breaking 18 trillion dollars", and later on repeated, "18 trillion dollars is invested". He has made similar claims before - in October he said the US had attracted investments worth $17tn (£12.7tn) - but there is no publicly available evidence to support figures this big. A White House website, last updated in November, aims to track "new investment in U.S. manufacturing, technology, and infrastructure". It states that investments under Trump total $9.6tn (£7.1tn). The biggest amount on the list is a $1.4tn (£1tn) investment in manufacturing and industry by the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The website for the UAE embassy in Washington DC says the UAE is "working with the Trump Administration to make a historic $1.4 trillion investment in the US over the next decade". Greg Auclair, a statistician at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told BBC Verify the White House tracker "includes pledges that may not materialize - for example the EU trade deal now appears frozen due to Greenland tensions". On Wednesday the European Parliament's international trade committee said it was suspending the ratification of the deal "until the US decides to re-engage on a path of cooperation rather than confrontation". Auclair added that although there has been an uptick in foreign investment in the US over the past year, "it will take several years before the results of the Trump administration's investment push become clear".

Photos leaked to BBC show faces of hundreds killed in Iran's brutal protest crackdown Warning: this story contains graphic content which some readers might find distressing Hundreds of photos revealing the faces of those killed during Iran's violent crackdown on anti-government protests have been leaked to BBC Verify. The pictures, which are too graphic to show without blurring, reveal the bloodied, swollen and bruised faces of at least 326 victims - including 18 women. The images, displayed in a south Tehran mortuary, are one of the only ways families have been able to identify their dead loved ones. Many of the victims were too disfigured to be identified, and 69 people had been labelled in Persian as John or Jane Doe, suggesting their identity was unknown when the photo was taken. Only 28 of the victims had labels with clearly visible names in the photos. Labels on more than 100 victims, who had their date of death recorded, showed that date as 9 January, one of the deadliest nights for protesters in Tehran so far. The city's streets were set on fire during clashes with security forces, with protesters chanting slogans against the supreme leader and the Islamic Republic. It followed a call for nationwide protests from Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the late shah. The leaked photos provide a small snapshot of the thousands believed to have been killed at the hands of the Iranian state. BBC Verify has been tracking the spread of protests across Iran since they erupted in late December, but the near total internet blackout imposed by the authorities has made it extremely difficult to document the scale of the government's violence against those who oppose it. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has publicly acknowledged several thousand people have been killed but blamed the US, Israel and those he described as "seditionists". Despite the blackout entering its third week, a small number of people have managed to get some information out. Hundreds of close-up images of victims taken from inside the Kahrizak Forensic Medical Centre were leaked to BBC Verify. We analysed 392 photos of victims and were able to identify 326 people - some had multiple pictures taken of them from different angles. Sources claimed the true number of dead at the mortuary ran into the thousands. One source, who we are not naming for their safety, told us they weren't prepared for the level of devastation they encountered inside the mortuary complex, and said they saw victims ranging from as young as 12 or 13 to 60 and 70-year-olds. "It was just too much," they said. Amid the chaos inside the mortuary, family members and friends were huddled together around a screen, we were told. They were trying to identify their loved ones while hundreds of images of the dead flicked across the screen. The slideshow lasted for hours, they said, adding that many of the victims' injuries were so severe they could not be identified. One man's face was so swollen his eyes were barely visible. Another man still had a breathing tube in his mouth, suggesting he died after receiving medical treatment. Some victims were so badly injured that their families asked to see the pictures again and to zoom in on their faces to make sure it was really them, we were told. At other times people recognised their loved ones instantly and were seen collapsing to the floor, screaming. Many photos showed unzipped body bags with papers laid close to their faces, identifying them by name, ID number or date of death. In some cases, we were told, the only identifier was a bank card laid on top of a body bag – the victims' last remaining possession. BBC Verify has separately corroborated videos from the same mortuary that demonstrate the violence perpetrated against protesters. One shows the body of what appears to be a child, while another shows a man with a clear gunshot wound in the middle of his head. Both videos are too distressing to show. Some Iranians have been posting the names of victims killed by security forces when they manage to connect to the internet through Starlink or even using networks from neighbouring countries, though these opportunities are incredibly rare. We checked the names of victims identified in the mortuary against social media posts reporting the names of the dead and found five matches, but are not revealing the names as we cannot contact the victims' families. BBC Verify has tracked the spread of anti-government protests across 71 towns and cities in Iran since they first erupted on 28 December through verified video, though the true number of areas where demonstrations have taken place is likely much higher. The few images that people have managed to upload through Starlink show burnt-out cars left in the streets, while verified videos recorded rounds of gunshots fired around Tehran during protests. The internet blackout has made it extremely difficult to document the full extent of the death toll from the protests. However, US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) has placed its current estimate at more than 4,000 deaths.
