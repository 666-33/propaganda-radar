Former CNN host Don Lemon arrested after anti-ICE protests at Minnesota church Former CNN host Don Lemon has been arrested after he entered a Minnesota church and filmed anti-immigration enforcement protesters as they disrupted a service. Lemon was taken into custody by federal agents on Thursday night while in Los Angeles covering the Grammy Awards, according to a statement from his lawyer Abbe Lowell. "Don will fight these charges vigorously and thoroughly in court," the attorney said. Lemon went into the Cities Church in St Paul on 19 January with a group of protesters who said one of the pastors was an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) official. "Don has been a journalist for 30 years, and his constitutionally protected work in Minneapolis was no different than what he has always done," Lowell said in a statement posted to Lemon's Instagram account on Friday. The lawyer added: "This unprecedented attack on the First Amendment and transparent attempt to distract attention from the many crises facing this administration will not stand." In his own defence, Lemon said in a recent video: "Once the protest started in the church, we did an act of journalism, which was report on it." President Donald Trump's administration initially sought to charge eight people involved in the Minnesota church protest, citing a law that protects people in places of worship. But a magistrate judge who reviewed the evidence presented by the justice department approved charges for only three of those involved, excluding Lemon. The government then sought to challenge that decision, but was turned away by an appeals court. US Attorney General Pam Bondi criticised the protests during a previous visit to Minneapolis, saying in a Fox News interview that the scene was "horrific". "We're going to pursue this to the ends of the Earth," Harmeet Dhillon, from the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division, said during an interview with podcaster Megyn Kelly on Friday. The protests were part of ongoing unrest in Minnesota, where an operation by federal immigration agents has sparked confrontations that have left two US citizens dead. Jim Acosta, Lemon's former CNN colleague, wrote on social media in response to the arrest: "This is outrageous and cannot stand. The First Amendment is under attack in America!"

**Excerpt**

Syrian government reaches deal with Kurdish-led forces Syria's government has reached a deal with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) militia alliance that would see the gradual intergration of Kurdish forces and institutions into the state. This comes after weeks of clashes which saw Syrian troops reclaim large swathes of territory in the north-east that had been under SDF control for more than a decade. US envoy Tom Barrack called it "a profound and historic milestone in Syria's journey toward national reconciliation, unity, and enduring stability". Earlier this month - and after its major territorial losses - the SDF agreed to a ceasefire that saw much of its hold brought under government control, but reports of clashes continued. Much like that 14-point agreement, Friday's deal would see SDF withdraw from points of contact, its members join the Syrian army and government, and the integration of its administrative and civil bodies into those of the state. The SDF said the agreement also includes the formation of a military division consisting of three brigades made of its members. The statement on X added that an agreement on the civil and educational rights for Kurdish people was also reached, as well as a guarantee that those displaced would be allowed to return to their homes. Part of the deal saw the transfer of prisons, oil and gas fields - which were under SDF control - to Damascus. Syrian troops seized control of the Omar facility, the country's largest oilfield, after the SDF pulled back. Earlier, the army took the strategic Tabqa dam on the Euphrates river. The Kurds previously controlled nearly a third of Syria's territory with the support of the US after it helped defeat the Islamic State (IS) group. Their recent losses mark the biggest change of control in the country since the toppling of former leader Bashar al-Assad in December 2024, which ended Syria's 13-year civil war. Since leading the rebel offensive that overthrew the Assad regime, Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa has vowed to reunify a divided Syria. After the ceasefire was agreed on 18 January, he said he hoped it would allow the country to "end its state of division and move to a state of unity and progress". Sharaa also issued a decree recognising Kurdish cultural, linguistic and civil rights by making Kurdish a national language, granting nationality to stateless Kurds, and declaring their new year a national holiday. This is the first formal recognition of Kurdish national rights since Syria's independence in 1946. This agreement followed months of stalled negotiations over a March 2025 integration deal, which both sides had accused each other of trying to derail.

### 3. [Panama voids Hong Kong-based firm's canal port contracts](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c338ygzl7meo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

Panama voids Hong Kong-based firm's canal port contracts Panama's Supreme Court has annulled contracts allowing a Hong Kong-based company to operate container ports on the Panama Canal. The ruling comes a year after US President Donald Trump claimed China was "operating the Panama Canal" - the main shipping link between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans - in his inaugural speech. CK Hutchison Holding, through its subsidiary the Panama Ports Company (PPC), has operated two of the five ports since the 1990s. It had previously agreed to sell them to a group led by a US investment firm under a wider deal. The court found that laws allowing the firm to operate the ports were "unconstitutional", but PPC said the ruling "lacks legal basis". Trump has made repeated claims that the Central American canal is under Chinese control. During his address last January, he said: "China is operating the Panama Canal and we didn't give it to China. We gave it to Panama and we're taking it back." The following month, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio also demanded that Panama make "immediate changes" to what he called the "influence and control" of China over the canal. Panama has previously rejected the US government's claims and President Jose Raul Mulino has said the canal "is and will remain" in his country's hands. There is no public evidence to suggest China exercises control over the canal, though Chinese companies have a significant presence there. But Beijing's tighter political control over Hong Kong in recent years has changed how the company is viewed internationally. Its global assets - which include ports and logistics hubs - are now often seen through the lens of wider concerns about China's influence. Against a backdrop of rivalry between the US and China over global trade routes, as well as the Trump administration's focus on US dominance over the western hemisphere, the ruling on Thursday is likely to be seen as a victory for Washington. Panama's Supreme Court said in a statement published on its website that, after "extensive deliberation", it had found that laws that underpin a concession contract between the state and PPC at the ports of Balbao and Cristóbal were unconstitutional. In response, PPC said the new ruling lacks legal basis, and "jeopardises not only PPC and its contract, but also the well-being and stability of thousands of Panamanian families who depend directly and indirectly on port activity". Its statement added that it had invested more than $1.8bn (£1.3bn) in infrastructure and technology since it began operating the ports in 1997. Mulino said ports in the country will continue to operate without disruption despite the ruling. APM Terminals Panama, a subsidiary of Danish shipping company Maersk, will temporarily manage the Balbao and Cristóbal sites. The company told the BBC in a statement that it "aims to mitigate any risks that could impact essential services for regional and global trade". On Friday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said that the country would take "all necessary measures to resolutely safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies". Hong Kong's government also said it firmly rejected the ruling. The Panamanian court's decision could disrupt plans by CK Hutchison to sell its interests in ports worldwide to a consortium led by US investment firm BlackRock and shipping group MSC under a deal worth $22.8bn. Both firms have been contacted for comment by the BBC. The sale was widely seen as an attempt by CK Hutchison to reduce political risk in sensitive locations while raising money from valuable assets. Trump had previously hailed the plans, which would place key assets under majority US ownership, while the Chinese government had criticised them for not being in the national interest. Markets reacted quickly to the court decision. CK Hutchison's shares fell 4.6% in Hong Kong trading, pushing down the Hang Seng Index down by more than 2% - a sign of both the company's importance to the market and growing investor concern about political risk. Up to 14,000 ships use the 51-mile (82km) Panama Canal each year as a shortcut between the Atlantic and Pacific. The waterway, which handles about 5% of global maritime trade volume, is operated by the Panama Canal Authority, an agency of the Panamanian government. From October 2023 to September 2024, China accounted for 21.4% of the cargo volume transiting the canal, making it the second-largest user after the US.

**Excerpt**

Burkina Faso junta announces ban on all political parties Burkina Faso's junta has announced a ban on all political parties, whose activities have been suspended since the military seized power in 2022. Junta leader Captain Ibrahim Traoré has been criticised for suppressing dissent and the move will be seen as the latest move to tighten control. According to Burkina Faso's Interior Minister Emile Zerbo, the ban is part of plans to "rebuild the state" after what he said were "numerous abuses" in the country's multiparty system. Zerbo said the system had been "promoting division among citizens and weakening the social fabric". Parties were previously banned from holding public gatherings but the new decree stops them from operating altogether. All the assets of the dissolved parties would be transferred to the state, Zerbo said, adding that a draft law would be sent to the Transitional Legislative Assembly "as soon as possible". The country had more than 100 registered political parties before the coup, with 15 represented in parliament after the 2020 general election. "This will not help the country move forward. We're not happy with this," a member of a civil society group, who did not want to be named for fear of reprisals, told the BBC. "The regime has been pushing the idea that democracy is useless or harmful for Burkina. [Traoré] may be settling in for the long run but given the country's history, no leader is ever fully secure. Another coup is never far from the horizon." The banning of political parties also received some backlash on social media, but a number of other Burkinabes went online to support the junta's decision. "It is undeniable that a country like Burkina Faso having over 100 political parties creates chaos," one Traoré supporter said on X. "This fragmentation often led to clientelism and corruption, where parties function more like business ventures than civic organisations." Traoré's 2022 coup ousted Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba, who had taken power only nine months earlier. Traoré pledged to restore the civilian government by 1 July 2024 but two months before this deadline, the junta announced it would extend its rule for another five years. Despite his authoritarian reputation, 37-year-old Traoré has gained a huge following across the continent for his pan-Africanist vision and criticism of Western influence. Burkina Faso is one of several West African countries who have experienced coups, followed by the restriction of political parties and electoral institutions, in recent years. One of the coup leaders, Guinea's Gen Mamady Doumbouya, last month stood for election and won by a landslide.

**Excerpt**

At least 170 killed in air strikes during Myanmar's widely criticised election, UN says At least 170 people were killed in military air strikes during Myanmar's weeks' long election period, the United Nations has said. "Credible sources" had counted the civilian deaths, the UN rights office said, as well as 408 military aerial attacks from December 2025 to late last week, when the third and final round of voting was held. The election itself has already been widely denounced as a sham, by numerous countries and human rights groups. The Union and Solidarity Party (USDP), backed by Myanmar's military, won an overwhelming victory, according to state media - an outcome which was expected following the tightly-controlled vote. Voting was not possible in large parts of the country, which has been engulfed in civil war sparked by a military coup which saw the democratically elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi ousted and imprisoned in 2021. Her party, the National League for Democracy, which won landslides in the two elections prior to the coup, was not allowed to contest the vote. Many believe the military junta will use the vote to maintain its power through proxy political parties. UN rights chief Volker Turk described the election as "staged by the military" in a statement released on Friday. He pointed out that "opposition candidates and some ethnic groups were excluded" from standing in the election, which had its first round on 28 December. Turk added that people had made decisions "to vote or not to vote purely out of fear, flatly at odds with their internationally guaranteed civil and political rights". Meanwhile, "the conflict and insecurity continued unabated in large parts of the country". James Rodehaver, head of UN Human Rights' Myanmar team, said the figures on civilian deaths in military strikes were drawn from the period between the start of campaigning, in December, to the final voting day in late January. The figures, which came from open sources, are likely to be currently incomplete "because of the way in which communications are cut off and... the fear of individuals in some of these locations to speak to us", he added, according to news agency AFP.

**Excerpt**

Trump and his sons sue IRS and US Treasury over leaked tax information US President Donald Trump and his two sons have filed a billion-dollar lawsuit against the federal government over leaks of their business and personal tax returns. The civil complaint, filed in Miami federal court, seeks $10bn (£7.25bn) in damages. The Trump family accuses the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) - the US-wide tax body - and the Treasury Department of failing to prevent the disclosure of "confidential, personal financial information" by a former IRS contractor. The contractor, Charles "Chaz" Littlejohn, is serving a five-year prison sentence after being convicted of leaking the tax disclosures to US media outlets. Ahead of the 2016 election, Trump said he would not release his tax returns because he was under audit, making him the first in almost 50 years to not disclose the documents. He said the same ahead of his 2020 re-election run. But then in September 2020, just before the November election, The New York Times published an extensive report on Trump's tax returns, revealing he paid only $750 in federal income taxes the year he won the presidency and no taxes at all in 10 of the previous 15 years. The lawsuit states that both the IRS and Treasury Department "had a duty to safeguard and protect" such disclosures from being shared publicly but "failed to take such mandatory precautions". Trump, his sons Donald Trump Jr, Eric Trump and the Trump Organization said in the lawsuit that they suffered reputational and financial harm, along with public embarrassment from leaks to the New York Times and ProPublica, which "unfairly tarnished" their business reputations, portrayed them in a false light and negatively affected their public standing, according to the filing. Littlejohn pleaded guilty in 2023 to stealing tax data from Trump and thousands of wealthy Americans while working as a contractor for the IRS. In 2024, he was sentenced to five years in prison. The lawsuit accuses him of weaponising his access to "unmasked taxpayer data to further his own personal, political agenda, believing that he was above the law". "Littlejohn committed these crimes because he considered President Trump to be 'dangerous' and a 'threat to democracy,' and that disclosure was, in Littlejohn's view, necessary due to political 'norms,'" the lawsuit says. When asked in a deposition if Littlejohn was looking to cause some kind of harm to Trump, he said: "Less about harm, more just about a statement. I mean, there's little harm that can actually be done to him, I think... He's shown a remarkable resilience." Trump resigned from his namesake company and hundreds of affiliated entities in 2017 before taking office during his first term.

**Excerpt**

South Africa and Israel expel each other's envoys in diplomatic row South Africa has expelled Israel's top diplomat in the country for "violating diplomatic norms", a move that prompted Israel to kick out a South African envoy in retaliation. The diplomatic row started when South Africa's foreign affairs ministry declared Ariel Seidman, chargé d'affaires at the Israeli embassy, persona non grata and gave him 72 hours to leave the country. Hours later, Israel announced similar action against South Africa's representative in that country, Shaun Edward Byneveldt. Relations between the two countries have been frosty since South Africa accused Israel of genocide against Palestinians at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), a charge Israel has rejected. South Africa accused Seidman of using official social media platforms to attack Ramaphosa and inviting Israeli officials to the country without permission. Israel does not currently have an ambassador in the country. Announcing Seidman's expulsion, South Africa's foreign affairs ministry said his actions "represent a gross abuse of diplomatic privilege". Shortly afterwards, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar hit back and announced that "following South Africa's false attacks against Israel in the international arena and the unilateral, baseless step taken" against [Seidman], Byneveldt is also persona non grata and would have to leave Israel within 72 hours. "Additional steps will be considered in due course," the Israeli government told the BBC. Seidman was appointed chargé d'affaires at Israel's embassy in South Africa last year and his role also extends to the neighbouring countries of Eswatini, Lesotho, Madagascar, Mauritius and Namibia. Since then his close ties with Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo, a controversial South African king who is also Nelson Mandela's nephew, have come in for criticism from Ramaphosa's government. Dalindyebo visited Israel in December - and met high-ranking officials, without the knowledge of the South African government. On his return home, an Israeli delegation visited the monarch's home province of the Eastern Cape with the promise of aid. Israeli officials recently posted videos and images on X of their trip, which they said was to discuss "concrete assistance in water, health and agriculture". South Africa has several recognised monarchs representing different ethnic groups and clans, but they have no formal political power.

Indonesian couple caned 140 times for sex and alcohol offences A couple in Indonesia has been caned 140 times for having sex outside marriage and drinking alcohol because it violates Sharia, or Islamic religious law. The 21-year-old woman fainted after what authorities said was a record number of strokes to be meted out in a public caning session in the Aceh province. Three female officers took turns striking her with a rattan cane, while she cried. After she collapsed, she was carried off the stage by female officers to an ambulance. The couple were caned on Thursday along with four others, including an officer from the Islamic police force, who were all found guilty of violating Sharia. Caning is a common punishment for breaking Islamic law in religiously conservative Aceh, although the practice has long drawn criticism from rights groups who say it's cruel. Under Aceh's Islamic criminal code, sex outside marriage is punishable by 100 strokes of the cane, while consuming alcohol carries 40 strokes. Canings are not regulated properly, says Azharul Husna, the Aceh coordinator for Indonesian rights group Kontras, adding that the rules around such punishments should be "improved" to support people after they're caned. The officer from the Islamic police force was caned 23 times, as was his female partner, for being in close proximity in a private place. He was caught alone with her in her house, Muhammad Rizal, the head of Aceh's Islamic police force told BBC Indonesian, adding that the officer would be dismissed. Aceh is the only province in Muslim-majority Indonesia to enforce the Sharia, and punishes many of the offences with public canings. Additional reporting by Astudestra Ajengrastri

Man accused of impersonating FBI agent in bid to free Luigi Mangione A man accused of impersonating a federal agent in a bid to allegedly free Luigi Mangione, the man accused of gunning down the CEO of United Healthcare in 2024, has been arrested. Mark Anderson, 36, is accused of going to the New York jail where Mangione is being housed and allegedly posing as an FBI agent, a criminal complaint states. He allegedly said he had paperwork that had been "signed by a judge" to free the accused killer. Though the complaint does not name Mangione, a law enforcement source told the BBC that Anderson allegedly sought to free him. He appeared before a judge on Thursday but has not entered a plea. The BBC has contacted an attorney said to be representing him. Anderson approached the intake area of the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn on Wednesday and is accused of telling officers that he was an FBI agent, the criminal complaint states. He said he had paperwork "signed by a judge" to authorise the release of an inmate. When officers asked him for credentials, Anderson provided a Minnesota driver's licence, claimed be in possession of weapons, and "displayed and threw" what authorities described as "numerous documents" at jail staff, according to the complaint. Bureau of Prisons officials then detained Anderson and searched his bag, where they found a large "barbecue type fork" with two prongs and a tool that resembles a pizza cutter. The suspect had travelled to New York City for a job opportunity from Mankato, Minnesota, and had been working at a local pizzeria, according to the law enforcement source. Anderson is facing a charge of impersonating an officer. Mangione has been held at the Brooklyn jail since 2024. He was arrested in a McDonalds in Pennsylvania after a multi-state manhunt and then extradited to New York. He faces both state and federal charges in the killing of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson and has pleaded not guilty. Since his arrest, Mangione has attracted a legion of supporters both online and at his court appearances. The killing also launched a debate in the US over healthcare costs. Jury selection for Mangione's highly anticipated federal trial is currently scheduled for September.

**Excerpt**

Music legend Fela Kuti becomes first African to get Grammys Lifetime Achievement Award Long crowned by his legion of fans as the king of Afrobeat, the late Fela Kuti is finally being recognised by the global music industry. The Nigerian star will posthumously receive a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Grammys - almost three decades after his death at the age of 58. "Fela has been in the hearts of the people for such a long time. Now the Grammys have acknowledged it, and it's a double victory," his musician son Seun Kuti tells the BBC. "It's bringing balance to a Fela story," he adds. Rikki Stein, a long-time friend and manager of the late musician, says the recognition by the Grammys is "better late than never". "Africa hasn't in the past rated very highly in their interests. I think that's changing quite a bit of late," Stein tells the BBC. Following the global success of Afrobeats, a genre inspired by Fela's sound, the Grammys introduced the category of Best African Performance in 2024. This year, Nigerian superstar Burna Boy also has a nomination in the Best Global Music Album category. But Fela Kuti will be the first African to receive a Lifetime Achievement Award, albeit posthumously. The award was first presented in 1963 to American singer and actor Bing Crosby. Other musicians who will receive the award this year include Mexican-American guitarist Carlos Santana, Chaka Khan, the American singer known as the Queen of Funk, and Paul Simon. Fela Kuti's family, as well friends and colleagues, will be attending the Grammys to receive his award. "The global human tapestry needs this, not just because it's my father," Seun Kuti tells the BBC. Stein says it is important to recognise Fela as a man who championed the cause of people who had "drawn life's short straw", adding that he "castigated any form of social injustice, corruption [and] mismanagement" in government. "So it would be impossible to ignore that aspect of Fela's legacy," he tells the BBC. For Fela Anikulapo Kuti was not simply a musician, but also a cultural theorist, political agitator and the undisputed architect of Afrobeat - which is distinct from, but ultimately led to, the modern sound of Afrobeats. He pioneered the Afrobeat genre alongside drummer Tony Allen, blending West African rhythms, jazz, funk, highlife, extended improvisation, call-and-response vocals and politically charged lyricism. Across a career spanning roughly three decades until his death in 1997, Fela Kuti released more than 50 albums and built a body of work that fused music with ideology, rhythm with resistance, and performance with protest. His music incurred the wrath of Nigeria's then-military regimes. In 1977, after the release of the album Zombie, which satirised government soldiers as obedient, brainless enforcers, his compound in the main city, Lagos, was raided. Known as Kalakuta Republic, the property was burned, residents were brutalised, and his mother, Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti, later died from injuries sustained during the assault. Rather than retreat, Fela Kuti responded through music and defiance. He took his mother's coffin to government offices and released the song Coffin for Head of State, turning grief into protest. The musician's ideology was a blend of pan-Africanism, anti-imperialism, and African-rooted socialism. Fela Kuti's mother was hugely influential in his life, helping shape his political consciousness, while the US-born singer and activist Sandra Izsadore helped sharpen his revolutionary outlook He was born Olufela Olusegun Oludoton Ransome-Kuti, but dropped Ransome because of its Western roots. In 1978, he married 27 women in a highly publicised ceremony, bringing together partners, performers, organisers and co-architects of the cultural and communal vision of Kalakuta Republic. Fela Kuti endured repeated arrests, beatings, censorship and surveillance by the security forces. Yet repression only amplified his influence. "He wasn't doing what he was doing to win awards. He was interested in liberation. Freeing the mind," Stein tells the BBC. "He was fearless. He was determined." Fela Kuti's musical evolution was shaped not only by Nigeria but also by Ghana. During the 1950s and 1960s, highlife music, pioneered by Ghanaian musicians such as ET Mensah, Ebo Taylor and Pat Thomas, became a defining sound across West Africa. Its melodic guitar lines, horn sections, dance rhythms, and cosmopolitan identity deeply influenced Fela Kuti's early musical direction. He spent time in Ghana absorbing highlife's structure, horn phrasing, and dance-oriented arrangements before fusing it with jazz, funk, the rhythms of his own Yoruba people, and political storytelling. The DNA of highlife can be heard in Afrobeat's melodic sensibility and its balance between groove and sophistication. In this sense, Afrobeat is not only Nigerian. It is West African, pan-African, and diasporic in origin, carrying Ghana's musical imprint at its foundation. On stage, Fela Kuti cut an unmistakable figure. Often bare-chested or draped in the wax-printed fabric popular across West Africa, hair shaped into a crisp Afro, saxophone in hand, eyes alert with intensity, he commanded a large band of more than 20 musicians. His performances at the Afrika Shrine in Lagos were legendary, part concert, part political rally, part spiritual ceremony. Stein recalls that performances at the Shrine were immersive rather than conventional. "When Fela played, nobody applauded," he tells the BBC. "The audience wasn't separate. They were part of it." Music was not spectacle. It was communion. Fela Kuti's visual identity was shaped in part by artist and designer Lemi Ghariokwu, who created 26 of his album covers between 1974 and 1993. "Fela has been an ancestor for 28 years. His legacy is growing by the day. This is immortality," Ghariokwu tells the BBC, welcoming the posthumous award. Today, Fela Kuti's music is still popular with millions around the world, and his influence is audible in modern artists such as Burna Boy, Kendrick Lamar and Sir Idris Elba. Elba is a huge fan - the award-winning actor and DJ has curated an official vinyl box set, Fela Kuti Box Set 6, and has publicly compared him to icons such as Sade and Frank Sinatra to illustrate the point that Fela Kuti has his own unique sound. Fela Kuti performed at major international festivals in Europe and North America, introducing global audiences to a bold and politically charged version of modern Africa. Seun Kuti was just 14 when his father died. "Fela never made me feel like I was a child," he recalls. "He didn't hide anything from me. He talked about everything openly." There was no myth-building. "I didn't even realise my dad was famous," he says. "That's credit to him. He kept me grounded." What stayed with him most was not spectacle, but discipline, clarity and humanity. "The human part of him, leadership, musicianship, fatherhood, that was the epitome of who he was." One of Seun Kuti's most revealing reflections speaks to independence and identity. "Fela was our dad, but you didn't own him. Fela belonged to himself. But we all belonged to him." Fela Kuti insisted on being addressed by name, not by title, even by his children. Seun recalls having his pocket money docked after calling him "Pops", a moment that carried a lesson in respect. "He always reminded us that he was in service to others more than himself." That ethic shaped Seun's evolution from youthful ambition toward cultural responsibility. "I used to make music to make money. But as I've grown, I lean more toward working for my people as well as my art." Fela Kuti led multiple ensembles, most famously Africa 70 and later Egypt 80, the latter now carried forward by his son. These were not conventional backing bands. They were musical militias, trained in discipline, endurance, and ideological purpose. Stein recalls Fela Kuti's obsessive attention to detail. "He tuned every instrument personally. Music wasn't entertainment to him. It was his mission."

Worried families in India urge return of crew on ship seized by Iran The families of 16 Indian seafarers held in Iran since December say they are anxious about the fate of their loved ones as the geopolitical situation in the region remains tense. On 8 December, Iranian authorities seized an oil tanker, MT Valiant Roar, while it was in international waters. They alleged that the ship, operated by Dubai-based Prime Tankers LLC, was carrying 6,000 metric tonnes of illegal diesel. The company has denied this. Apart from the 16 Indians, the crew has one person each from Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. The Indian families of the crew members have approached the Delhi high court, asking it to issue urgent directions to the government to secure consular access and ensure their safe return. According to documents submitted by India's foreign ministry in a Delhi court, 10 of the Indian crew members have been arrested and moved to a jail in Iran while the others remain on board the ship. The ministry said it has now gained consular access to the 10 arrested men who are being held in Bandar Abbas prison. "The Indian embassy has learned that the Iranian side will facilitate access to the six Indian seafarers on board the vessel once requisite clearances are received from the Iranian Navy/Prosecutor's office," it added. Relatives of the detained crew members allege they have been confined to a tiny room on the vessel without proper food or potable drinking water. While most of their laptops and phones have been taken away, one phone was returned, allowing them to have limited contact with their families, they said. The BBC has sent detailed questions to the Iranian embassy in Delhi about the allegations but has not received a response. Press Secretary Agha Mahdi Esfandiari said in a brief phone conversation that he had no information about Indian crew members being arrested or detained in Iran. The BBC has also sent questions to the high commissions of Sri Lanka and Bangladesh in Delhi about the status of their citizens on the ship. While Iran had granted approval for consular access to the 10 arrested Indians on 10 January, this "did not happen at that time, presumably, due to the prevailing situation in Iran", according to the documents. The political situation in Iran has been turbulent over the past few weeks. Widespread protests broke out in the last week of December, initially triggered by anger against economic grievances and later expanding into calls for a regime change. Since then, there has been a significant build-up of US military forces in the region, raising speculation of a possible strike. Jugwinder Brar, owner of Prime Tankers, told the BBC that the protests in Iran had prevented the company's lawyer from meeting the crew. He also denied the allegations by Iranian authorities, saying that the vessel was carrying Very Low Sulphur Fuel Oil (VLSFO), a marine fuel used for refuelling the company's other ships in international waters. "This is standard practice," he told the BBC. He alleged that Iran also seized another ship owned by Prime Tankers in December 2023 due to similar claims of carrying illegal fuel. Of its 21 crew members, 18 were released after nine months, but three remain imprisoned, he said. Brar insisted that both ships carried valid documents for VLSFO and the company's priority was to ensure the safe return of all crew members to India. Brar and his companies, including Prime Tankers, are subject to US sanctions, with the treasury department alleging that many of his vessels operate as "part of Iran's shadow fleet" to transport oil. When asked why the US sanctioned him, Brar said: "America is an unchallenged country; no-one can question it. It can do whatever it wants." He also claimed that Iran may have seized his ship as they "probably thought that the ship had an American or Israeli owner". Domestic fuel prices in Iran are among the lowest in the world, mainly due to heavy government subsidies and authorities have said they routinely monitor maritime traffic around its waters to crack down on smuggling of fuel. Families and company officials of the seized ship allege that the crew are being held in a small room, where they also sleep at night. A relative of a detained crew member told the BBC on Thursday that food and fuel - which the Iranian navy last supplied nearly a week ago - are running low. The crew also does not have access to potable drinking water. Another concern, the person added, is that most of the ship's generators have stopped working. This has led to problems with the vessel's waste disposal and cleaning mechanisms, leading to blocked toilets and unsanitary living conditions, they added. The ship was seized weeks before many of the crew were due to complete their nine-month contracts in January. Masood Alam, one of the 10 arrested men, is set to get married after Eid, which falls in March. "We had a short call with him on 5 January. Since then, we have had no information. He was already suffering from fever when detained," his father, Ibrar Ansari, told the BBC. Gayatri Singh, wife of chief officer Anil Kumar Singh, accused Iran of using the crew as "human shields". Cargo disputes, she said, should be settled with companies, not workers. "The company decides the cargo, not the crew. Sending them to jail is inhuman," said Pradeep Singh, general secretary of the Sailors' Union of India.

**Excerpt**

Why Iran's response to a US attack could be different this time The arrival of the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group into the US Central Command area of responsibility, close to Iranian waters, has sharpened the sense that a broader confrontation may be taking shape. Coming amid the most extensive and violent crackdown on protests in Iran in recent memory, the deployment underscores how close Washington and Tehran may now be to a direct showdown, closer than at any point in recent years. Iranian leaders find themselves squeezed between a protest movement increasingly demanding the removal of the regime itself and a US president who has kept his intentions deliberately opaque, fuelling anxiety not only in Tehran but across an already volatile region. Iran's response to a potential US military strike may not follow the familiar, carefully calibrated pattern seen in earlier confrontations with Washington. President Donald Trump's recent threats, made in the context of Iran's violent suppression of domestic unrest, come at a moment of exceptional internal strain for the Islamic Republic. As a result, any US attack now carries a significantly higher risk of rapid escalation, both regionally and inside Iran. In recent years, Tehran has shown a preference for delayed and limited retaliation. After US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities on 21-22 June 2025, Iran responded with a missile attack on the US-operated Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar the following day. According to President Trump, Iran had given advance warning of the strike, allowing air defences to intercept most of the missiles. No casualties were reported. The exchange was widely interpreted as a deliberate attempt by Iran to signal resolve while avoiding a wider war. A similar pattern emerged in January 2020, during Trump's first presidency. Following the US assassination of Quds Force commander, Qassem Soleimani near Baghdad airport on 3 January, Iran retaliated five days later by firing missiles at the US Ain al-Asad airbase in Iraq. Again, advance warning was provided. While no US personnel were killed, dozens later reported traumatic brain injuries. The episode reinforced the perception that Tehran sought to manage escalation rather than provoke it. The present moment, however, is markedly different. Iran is emerging from one of the most serious waves of domestic unrest since the establishment of the Islamic Republic in 1979. Protests that erupted in late December and early January were met with a severe violent crackdown. Human rights organisations and medical workers inside the country report that several thousand people have been killed, with many more injured or detained. The exact numbers cannot be verified due to a lack of access and an internet blackout which has continued for more than two weeks. Iranian authorities have not accepted responsibility for the deaths, instead blaming what they describe as "terrorist groups" and accusing Israel of fomenting the unrest. That narrative has been echoed at the highest levels of the state. Iran's secretary of the Supreme National Security Council said recently that the protests should be seen as a continuation of last summer's 12-day war with Israel, a framing that offers insight into the authorities' security-first response and that might have been used as an excuse to justify the scale and intensity of the crackdown. Although the scale of street protests has since diminished, they have not ended. The grievances remain unresolved, and the divide between large parts of society and the ruling system has rarely appeared so wide. On 8 and 9 January, security forces reportedly lost control of parts of several towns and neighbourhoods in major cities before reasserting authority through overwhelming force. That brief loss of control appears to have deeply unsettled the authorities. The calm that followed has been imposed rather than negotiated, leaving the situation highly combustible. Uncompromising rhetoric Against this backdrop, the nature of any US strike becomes critical. A limited attack may allow Washington to claim military success while avoiding immediate regional war, but it could also provide Iranian authorities with a pretext for another round of internal repression. Such a scenario risks fresh crackdowns, mass arrests and a new wave of harsh sentences, including death penalties, for protesters already in detention. At the other extreme, a broader US campaign that significantly weakens or cripples the Iranian state could push the country towards the brink of chaos. The sudden collapse of central authority in a country of more than 90 million people would be unlikely to produce a clean or rapid transition. Instead, it could trigger prolonged instability, factional violence, and spillover effects across the region, with consequences that may take years to contain. These risks help explain the increasingly uncompromising rhetoric from Tehran. Senior commanders in both the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the regular armed forces, along with senior political officials, have warned that any US attack-regardless of scale-would be treated as an act of war. Such declarations have unsettled Iran's neighbours, particularly Gulf states hosting US forces. A rapid Iranian response would place those countries - and Israel - at immediate risk, regardless of their direct involvement, and raises the prospect of a conflict spreading far beyond Iran and the United States. Washington, too, faces constraints. Trump has repeatedly warned Iranian authorities against using violence against protesters and, at the height of the unrest, told Iranians that "help is coming". Those remarks were widely circulated inside Iran and raised expectations among protesters. Both sides are aware of the broader strategic picture. Trump knows Iran is militarily weaker than it was before last summer's 12-day war, and Tehran is aware that he has little appetite for a full-scale, open-ended conflict. That mutual awareness may provide some reassurance, but it could also create dangerous misperceptions, with each side potentially overestimating its leverage or misreading the opponent's intentions. For Trump, finding a balance, whatever that might be, is crucial. He needs an outcome he can present as a victory, without tipping Iran into either a renewed cycle of repression or a descent into chaos. For Iranian leaders, the danger lies in timing and perception. Iran's previous model of delayed, symbolic retaliation may no longer be sufficient if leaders believe speed is essential to reassert deterrence on the outside and control inside of the country that was shaken by the scale of the recent unrests. Yet, a rapid response would sharply increase the risk of miscalculation, drawing regional actors into a conflict few can afford. With both sides under intense pressure and little room to manoeuvre, a long-running game of brinkmanship may be approaching its most dangerous moment, one in which the cost of getting the balance wrong would be borne not only by governments, but by millions of ordinary Iranians and the wider region beyond.

Inside Syrian camp holding wives and children of suspected IS fighters Following the downfall of the so-called Islamic State in Syria, Kurdish-run prisons hold about 8,000 suspected IS fighters and around 34,000 of their family members in camps. But there is growing instability in the region as the central government in Damascus wants to extend its control across all of Syria, including the Kurdish autonomous region in the north-east. In the past two weeks, government troops have pushed the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) out of resource-rich areas they have controlled for a decade – since defeating IS. Will the gates remain locked if this region becomes a battleground? The BBC's Orla Guerin visited Roj, a camp holding the wives and children of suspected IS fighters near the Turkish and Iraqi borders. Read more on this story.
