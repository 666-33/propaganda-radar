Man accused of impersonating FBI agent in bid to free Luigi Mangione A man accused of impersonating a federal agent in a bid to allegedly free Luigi Mangione, the man accused of gunning down the CEO of United Healthcare in 2024, has been arrested. Mark Anderson, 36, is accused of going to the New York jail where Mangione is being housed and allegedly posing as an FBI agent, a criminal complaint states. He allegedly said he had paperwork that had been "signed by a judge" to free the accused killer. Though the complaint does not name Mangione, a law enforcement source told the BBC that Anderson allegedly sought to free him. He appeared before a judge on Thursday but has not entered a plea. The BBC has contacted an attorney said to be representing him. Anderson approached the intake area of the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn on Wednesday and is accused of telling officers that he was an FBI agent, the criminal complaint states. He said he had paperwork "signed by a judge" to authorise the release of an inmate. When officers asked him for credentials, Anderson provided a Minnesota driver's license, claimed be in possession of weapons, and "displayed and threw" what authorities described as "numerous documents" at jail staff, according to the complaint. Bureau of Prisons officials then detained Anderson and searched his bag, where they found a large "barbeque type fork" with two prongs and a tool that resembles a pizza cutter. The suspect had travelled to New York City for a job opportunity from Mankato, Minnesota, and had been working at a local pizzeria, according to the law enforcement source. Anderson is facing a charge of impersonating an officer. Mangione has been held at the Brooklyn jail since 2024. He was arrested in a McDonalds in Pennsylvania after a multi-state manhunt and then extradited to New York. He faces both state and federal charges in the killing of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson and has pleaded not guilty. Since his arrest, Mangione has attracted a legion of supporters both online and at his court appearances. The killing also launched a debate in the US over healthcare costs. Jury selection for Mangione's highly anticipated federal trial is currently scheduled for September.

Republicans and Democrats reach funding package deal, US president says US President Donald Trump has said Republicans and Democrats in the Senate have reached an agreement to move forward with parts of a funding package. Senate Democrats and Republicans agreed to a package of five spending bills on Thursday, but removed a sixth bill from the package related to funding for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the BBC's US partner CBS News reported. Funding for DHS will continue at its current amount for two weeks while both sides work out a new deal to fund the agency, CBS News said. US President Donald Trump endorsed the deal, and wrote in a post on social media: "Hopefully, both Republicans and Democrats will give a very much needed Bipartisan "YES" Vote." The deal approves funding for the defence department, the health department, the treasury, the federal court system and other agencies until the end of the 2026 fiscal year on 30 September. In his post Trump added: "Republicans and Democrats in Congress have come together to get the vast majority of the Government funded until September, while at the same time providing an extension to the Department of Homeland Security (including the very important Coast Guard, which we are expanding and rebuilding like never before)." Democrats have been pushing to remove funding for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) from a $1.2tn (£870bn) federal spending package since a federal agent killed a second US citizen in Minneapolis over the weekend. The DHS is a sprawling department encompassing multiple agencies, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the Coast Guard and Secret Service. Thousands of federal agents from ICE and CBP have been deployed to Minnesota as part of the Trump administration's aggressive immigration crackdown in the state. In Minneapolis, an ICE agent shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Good on 7 January, and a Border Patrol officer shot and killed 37-year-old Alex Pretti on 24 January. Both killings, and the ongoing immigration operation in the state, have sparked protests around the country. The second shooting led Democrats, and some Republicans, to push back on approving DHS funding. Among the changes to DHS Democrats are seeking are requirements that federal agents obtain warrants before making arrests and clearer rules governing how they identify themselves. On Wednesday, some Senate Democrats escalated their demands, expressly calling for DHS Secretary Kristi Noem's removal, and for structural changes to both ICE and CBP. "This madness," Schumer said, "this terror must stop." Some Republicans pushed back, with John Cornyn of Texas saying that "any changes must not come at the expense of shutting down the government". What happens next? The spending bill had already passed in the House of Representatives, but in the Senate, it needed 60 votes to advance. There are only 53 Republican senators in the 100-member body, meaning that passing the bill required support from at least some Democratic members. Before the Senate reportedly agreed to remove the DHS bill from the package, a procedural vote to advance the budget failed in the Senate by 45-55 earlier on Thursday. All Democrats voted no, along with eight Republicans who said they were concerned about wasteful spending. Earlier this week, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer said: "I will vote no on any legislation that funds ICE until it is reined in and overhauled, and Senate Democrats are overwhelmingly united on this issue." Because the Senate removed the DHS bill from the six-bill package, the package will now need to be re-approved by the House, whose lawmakers are not due back until Monday. That means that funding for the departments included in the package could lapse over the weekend until the House convenes on Monday. The effects will be minimal though, as many government services do not operate over the weekend. What is a 'partial shutdown'? The entirety of the US federal government will not be hit by a shutdown if it does occur this weekend. It would only be partial because legislation has already been passed to fund dozens of agencies through the end of the 2026 fiscal year. Other branches included in the same spending bill as DHS, are the defence department, the health department, the treasury and the federal court system. The reported agreement between the Republicans and the Democrats would strip out the DHS from the funding bill, allowing Congress to pass the overall package of bills. DHS funding would be extended for two weeks, giving negotiators time to reach an agreement on immigration tactics, according to the reported deal. The DHS is a sprawling department encompassing multiple agencies, including ICE, CBP, the Coast Guard and Secret Service. During a partial shutdown employees that are "essential" to the functioning of impacted agencies continue to work, but will not be paid until funding is restored - unless the government finds other sources - as Trump did with military personnel last year. How long was the last shutdown? The most recent shutdown lasted 43 days between 1 October and 12 November last year, making it the longest in US history. Democrats had initially refused to support the funding bill, demanding that Republicans agree to extend health insurance subsidies for low-income Americans that were set to expire at the end of the year. Eventually, enough Democrats crossed the aisle to help pass the bill. That shutdown left around 1.4 million federal employees on unpaid leave or working without pay. Food aid was also left in limbo, and air travel was severely disrupted across the US. There have been a total of 16 government shutdowns since 1981, although some only lasted days.

### 3. [Melania Trump documentary not showing in South African cinemas](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c89q287qxelo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

Melania Trump documentary not showing in South African cinemas Cinemas in South Africa will not be showing the documentary about US First Lady Melania Trump that is due to be released around the world on Friday. The South African distributor Filmfinity has decided not to release it, its head of sales and marketing told the New York Times and South Africa-based website News24. The company was not explicit about the reasons behind the move. The film, Melania, is not promoted on the websites of the country's main cinema chains. One Cape Town independent cinema contacted by the BBC said that it was called by Filmfinity and told not to list it. Relations between the US and South Africa have seriously deteriorated over the past year. Amazon has reportedly paid $35m (£25m) to market the film which follows Melania Trump in the 20 days leading up to her husband's second inauguration on 20 January last year. It is also believed that Amazon paid around $40m for the rights to the film. "Based on recent developments, we've taken the decision to not go ahead with a theatrical release in territory," Filmfinity's Thobashan Govindarajulu is quoted as saying by the New York Times. He told News24 that the decision had been taken "given the current climate". The executive did not elaborate on what was he meant by "recent developments" or "current climate". Attempts by the BBC to get comment from Filmfinity, which describes itself as the leading film distributor in southern Africa, have so far been unsuccessful. But contacting the independent Labia cinema in Cape Town, the BBC was told that it was called by Filmfinity who said that the film would not be playing. Show times for Melania are not listed on the websites of South Africa's two main cinema chains, Ster Kinekor and Nu Metro. Nu Metro trailed the film on its Instagram account a fortnight ago. Its website's Melania page still exists, but does not list any show times - unlike the page for the drama Hamnet, which is also released in South Africa on Friday. Since Donald Trump came to power a year ago, US relations with South Africa have slumped. He has been promoting the widely discredited idea that there is a "white genocide" against South Africa's Afrikaner community. Last May, Trump confronted South African counterpart Cyril Ramaphosa over the issue in a tense White House meeting. The president has also imposed high tariffs on South African goods and cut aid programmes. His anger was also partly fuelled by Pretoria's role in bringing a case against Israel to the International Court of Justice (ICJ). The US ally has strongly rejected the allegation of genocide against Palestinians in Gaza as "baseless".

### 4. [Venezuela's oil ghost towns hope Trump plan will revive their fortunes](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgnp8n40reo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

Venezuela's oil ghost towns hope Trump plan will revive their fortunes With its neat rows of detached family homes, complete with grass lawns and porches, Miraflores could be mistaken for a typical American suburb. Located in the heartland of Venezuela's oil industry, on the Costa Oriental (Eastern Coast) of Venezuela's Lake Maracaibo, this quiet neighbourhood once helped to make the country one of the wealthiest in Latin America. It was a symbol of national prosperity. This used to be one of the world's most productive oil basins, and along with the city of Maracaibo, across the lake, is seen as key to President Donald Trump's plan to get US firms to invest $100bn (£75bn) to rebuild Venezuela's energy industry. The country has the world's largest proven oil reserves, estimated at about 303 billion barrels. But for now, the area around Lake Maracaibo stands as a stark reminder of how much the country's fortunes have declined over the decades. There are oil pumps and rigs dotted everywhere - on street corners, in surrounding fields and rising out of the lake. While a handful have been freshly painted in the yellow, blue and red of the national flag and remain operational, many others have not moved in years and are rusting and falling apart. The decay is striking in the 20 or so American-style "oil camps" on the fringes of the lake - these were originally built by international companies to house their workforce, after the commercial exploitation of Venezuela's oil reserves took off in the 1920s. Oil giants such as Standard Oil of New Jersey (which later became Exxon), Chevron and Shell invested heavily in Maracaibo, Venezuela's second-largest city. Oil money turned former fishing villages into affluent communities with hospitals, schools, and social clubs. In Miraflores, which housed the industry's top executives, many homes now sit abandoned and looted, their windows smashed and wiring stripped bare. Gladysmila Gil moved to a more modest neighbourhood nearby in 1968 with her late husband, who worked in the oil industry and had the home given to him. "When we moved into this house, it was in good condition," she recalls, sitting on a frayed chair and looking at the pink paint peeling off the walls. "If we were sick, we went to the hospital and they treated us. The rubbish was collected every other day, and we didn't have these power outages," she adds of the economic decline Venezuela has experienced over the past 13 years. Now rubbish is only collected sporadically and despite the oil reserves, the region has been hit by a severe energy crisis over the past decade with blackouts reported almost daily. An unfinished light rail system mired in corruption allegations, a run-down central hospital which patients have described as "hell" and deepening inequality make it feel like a microcosm of the country. Venezuela's gross domestic product (GDP) has declined by more than 70% since Nicolás Maduro became president in 2013. "You don't see kids in these streets, there is no youth. I used to live here with nine relatives, and they all left," says 64-year-old José Gregorio Martínez, the son of a former oil worker, sitting on his front porch. Fighting back tears, the retired teacher explains that he only survives thanks to the money his relatives send from abroad. His monthly state pension of $2.80 (£2) does not even cover his most basic needs. Gil and Martínez recall what they see as the golden days, and are not alone in hoping that new investment from US companies will transform their lives. In the 1970s, Venezuela pumped as much as 3.5 million barrels of oil per day - accounting for more than 7% of total global output. Then, production was managed by a network of foreign firms, many from the US, operating under government concessions, until the industry was nationalised in 1976 and taken over by the state-owned giant, PDVSA. The industry continued to form the backbone of the country's economy, benefiting from the high oil prices of the 1970s. When oil prices fell in the 1980s and Venezuela ran into an economic crisis, reality hit. There were protests as the government introduced austerity measures to try to balance the books. In the 1990s, reforms were introduced to open doors to foreign investment and in 1999 the country still produced about 3.2 million barrels of oil per day, with approximately half of that output coming from Zulia state, the region around Lake Maracaibo. Then came the rise of Chavismo - an anti-American, nationalist ideology created by Maduro's predecessor Hugo Chávez. He became president in 1999 as oil prices were on the rise again, enabling his government to fund huge social programmes designed to lift millions out of poverty. But by the end of 2025, oil output had fallen to about 860,000 barrels per day, less than 1% of global crude production. Many cite 2002 as a turning point for the industry, when a strike by oil workers against Chávez's government was followed by a sweeping overhaul of PDVSA. It is widely reported that up to 22,000 people were fired. "You can't lose 22,000 technical people in a company and expect that nothing happens," says Jorge, not his real name, who was dismissed at the time. He says the shake-up aimed to align the company with political priorities and that much of the experienced management resisted, ultimately losing their jobs. In 2007, the oil sector was transformed again when President Chávez's government seized control of the industry. Some foreign firms remained under new state-led partnerships, while others - most notably ExxonMobil - left the country, and the industry's decline accelerated. Mismanagement and corruption have been a problem for the sector, but the government has pointed the finger firmly at US sanctions as a major cause of the decline. Broad economic sanctions were put in place in 2017 during Trump's first term, in response to what it called "serious abuses of human rights… establishment of an illegitimate Constituent Assembly, which has usurped the power of the democratically elected National Assembly… rampant public corruption" and "persecution of, and violence toward, the political opposition". The turning point for the US came in early January this year when its military seized Nicolás Maduro from his compound in Caracas and took him to New York to face narco-terrorism charges - accusations he denies. President Donald Trump said the US would "run" Venezuela and control the sale of its sanctioned oil "indefinitely", but a Maduro loyalist - Delcy Rodríguez - has since taken control of Venezuela's armed forces and the country's institutions. While defiantly demanding the release of Maduro, who she says has been "kidnapped", Rodríguez has co-operated with the Trump administration to reform the law to allow foreign and local oil companies to operate oilfields again, through a new contract model. Many in Maracaibo are optimistic about potential US investment. "It would be better because then there would be work, and our children wouldn't have to resort to fishing. They could have a future instead," says Carlos Rodríguez. Now in his late 20s, he has worked these waters since he was a teenager. As he pulls his oil-stained boat out on to the lake, the view is striking. The beauty of the sky contrasts sharply with the water, sometimes blue, but often a murky green from cyanobacteria or stained black. It's easy to see the oil slicking the surface and when I dip my hand in, it comes out streaked with oil. "It's getting worse every day. Green, black, oily," Rodríguez complains. "And there are fewer fish." That morning, he didn't catch a single one. He hopes that if international oil companies return, they will help clean the lake. Others are wary. "We have no problem with [foreign companies] coming to exploit our resources, to drill wells and to create jobs," says another fisherman, José Luzardo. "But we don't want to be anyone's colony." He is a staunch Maduro loyalist, but admits that both his family and colleagues are struggling. Trump "can come, but he has to pay us for the oil… the oil belongs to Venezuela, it belongs to all Venezuelans", he says as he prepares to set sail. Many others - in particular people who oppose the government - avoid speaking about politics for fear of repercussions. Later, the sound of the lake's waves lapping against the side of Luzardo's house competes with the sizzle of hot oil. In a kitchen with bare, unplastered walls, a group of women fry the few fish caught that morning. Luzardo says they were lucky. Sometimes they come back home with nothing at all. On those days, they go to bed hungry. Both the government and the opposition agree on the need for investment. Juan Romero, a member of parliament representing Zulia and a local leader of the ruling PSUV party, says it is the key to the industry's revival. "In Lake Maracaibo, there are approximately 13,000 wells that could be recovered, and there are reserves of 26 billion barrels of oil," he says. With US sanctions removed, he believes the "economic strangulation" of the sector will end and that Venezuela will be able to attract foreign money. But analysts warn it could take a decade and hundreds of billions of dollars to restore the nation's former output, and industry giants remain cautious. ExxonMobil's chief executive, Darren Woods, labelled the nation "uninvestable" in its current state. Speaking at a White House summit following the removal of Maduro, he pointed out that the company had had its assets seized there twice "so you can imagine to re-enter a third time would require some pretty significant changes". Without a new legal framework and stronger protections for investors, he warned that the billions of dollars required for redevelopment would not materialise. Yet for many in Maracaibo, hope remains that investment and prosperity will return. Among them is 93-year-old José Rodas, a retired oil worker who still owns a special-edition Dodge Dart, a classic American muscle car that he bought during the 1970s oil boom. "Things have become more difficult," he says. "In the past, life was easier. We had comforts then." He points to the "commissariat", a central department within the oil camps that not only provided subsidised food but also maintained the workers' homes, with fresh coats of paint and new light bulbs. Today, the car sitting on his neglected porch feels like a faded relic of that former life.
