Trump says 'it would be great' if US 'didn't have to use' military force on Iran Donald Trump says he has told Iran it has to do "two things" to avoid military action, as the US builds up its forces in the Gulf. "Number one, no nuclear. And number two, stop killing protesters," the US President said, adding that "they are killing them by the thousands". "We have a lot of very big, very powerful ships sailing to Iran right now, and it would be great if we didn't have to use them." His latest remarks follow weeks of pressure on Iran to negotiate a deal on its nuclear programme. Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has said armed forces were ready "with their fingers on the trigger" to "immediately and powerfully respond" to any aggression. Trump made his latest comments at the premiere of a documentary about his wife Melania. Earlier this week, Trump wrote on Truth Social: "Hopefully Iran will quickly 'Come to the Table' and negotiate a fair and equitable deal - NO NUCLEAR WEAPONS." He warned that a "massive Armada is heading to Iran", and it was "ready, willing, and able to rapidly fulfil its mission, with speed and violence, if necessary". In response, Araghchi said: "Iran has always welcomed a mutually beneficial, fair and equitable NUCLEAR DEAL - on equal footing, and free from coercion, threats, and intimidation - which ensures Iran's rights to PEACEFUL nuclear technology, and guarantees NO NUCLEAR WEAPONS." "Such weapons have no place in our security calculations and we have NEVER sought to acquire them," he added. Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Kazem Gharibabadi said that no negotiations with the US were currently under way, despite "exchanges of messages". Earlier this month, Trump said that the US would come to the "rescue" of Iranian protesters if authorities used violence against them. Demonstrations began in late December after a sharp fall in the value of the Iranian currency, but swiftly evolved into a crisis of legitimacy for the country's clerical leadership. Though Trump initially promised that "help is on the way", he later said that he had been told on good authority that the execution of demonstrators had stopped. The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (Hrana) says it has so far confirmed the killing of at least 6,479 people since the unrest began, including 6,092 protesters, 118 children and 214 people affiliated with the government. It is also investigating approximately 17,000 more reported deaths. Iranian authorities said last week that more than 3,100 people had been killed, but that the majority were security personnel or bystanders attacked by "rioters". The European Union has since added Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) to its terrorist list, in addition to placing new sanctions on six entities and 15 individuals in Iran.

**Excerpt**

Trump and his sons sue IRS and US Treasury over leaked tax information US President Donald Trump and his two sons have filed a billion-dollar lawsuit against the federal government over leaks of their business and personal tax returns. The civil complaint, filed in Miami federal court, seeks $10bn (£7.25bn) in damages. The Trump family accuses the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) - the US-wide tax body - and the Treasury Department of failing to prevent the disclosure of "confidential, personal financial information" by a former IRS contractor. The contractor, Charles "Chaz" Littlejohn, is serving a five-year prison sentence after being convicted of leaking the tax disclosures to US media outlets. Ahead of the 2016 election, Trump said he would not release his tax returns because he was under audit, making him the first in almost 50 years to not disclose the documents. He said the same ahead of his 2020 re-election run. But then in September 2020, just before the November election, The New York Times published an extensive report on Mr Trump's tax returns, revealing he paid only $750 in federal income taxes the year he won the presidency and no taxes at all in 10 of the previous 15 years. The lawsuit states that both the IRS and Treasury Department "had a duty to safeguard and protect" such disclosures from being shared publicly but "failed to take such mandatory precautions". Trump, his sons Donald Trump Jr, Eric Trump and the Trump Organization said in the lawsuit that they suffered reputational and financial harm, along with public embarrassment from leaks to the New York Times and ProPublica, which "unfairly tarnished" their business reputations, portrayed them in a false light and negatively affected their public standing, according to the filing. Littlejohn pleaded guilty in 2023 to stealing tax data from Trump and thousands of wealthy Americans while working as a contractor for the IRS. In 2024, he was sentenced to five years in prison. The lawsuit accuses him of weaponising his access to "unmasked taxpayer data to further his own personal, political agenda, believing that he was above the law". "Littlejohn committed these crimes because he considered President Trump to be 'dangerous' and a 'threat to democracy,' and that disclosure was, in Littlejohn's view, necessary due to political 'norms,'" the lawsuit says. When asked in a deposition if Littlejohn was looking to cause some kind of harm to Trump, he said: "Less about harm, more just about a statement. I mean, there's little harm that can actually be done to him, I think. . . He's shown a remarkable resilience." Trump resigned from his namesake company and hundreds of affiliated entities in 2017 before taking office during his first term.

**Excerpt**

Music legend Fela Kuti becomes first African to get Grammys Lifetime Achievement Award Long crowned by his legion of fans as the king of Afrobeat, the late Fela Kuti is finally being recognised by the global music industry. The Nigerian star will posthumously receive a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Grammys - almost three decades after his death at the age of 58. "Fela has been in the hearts of the people for such a long time. Now the Grammys have acknowledged it, and it's a double victory," his musician son Seun Kuti tells the BBC. "It's bringing balance to a Fela story," he adds. Rikki Stein, a long-time friend and manager of the late musician, says the recognition by the Grammys is "better late than never". "Africa hasn't in the past rated very highly in their interests. I think that's changing quite a bit of late," Stein tells the BBC. Following the global success of Afrobeats, a genre inspired by Fela's sound, the Grammys introduced the category of Best African Performance in 2024. This year, Nigerian superstar Burna Boy also has a nomination in the Best Global Music Album category. But Fela Kuti will be the first African to receive a Lifetime Achievement Award, albeit posthumously. The award was first presented in 1963 to American singer and actor Bing Crosby. Other musicians who will receive the award this year include Mexican-American guitarist Carlos Santana, Chaka Khan, the American singer known as the Queen of Funk, and Paul Simon. Fela Kuti's family, as well friends and colleagues, will be attending the Grammys to receive his award. "The global human tapestry needs this, not just because it's my father," Seun Kuti tells the BBC. Stein says it is important to recognise Fela as a man who championed the cause of people who had "drawn life's short straw", adding that he "castigated any form of social injustice, corruption [and] mismanagement" in government. "So it would be impossible to ignore that aspect of Fela's legacy," he tells the BBC. For Fela Anikulapo Kuti was not simply a musician, but also a cultural theorist, political agitator and the undisputed architect of Afrobeat - which is distinct from, but ultimately led to, the modern sound of Afrobeats. He pioneered the Afrobeat genre alongside drummer Tony Allen, blending West African rhythms, jazz, funk, highlife, extended improvisation, call-and-response vocals and politically charged lyricism. Across a career spanning roughly three decades until his death in 1997, Fela Kuti released more than 50 albums and built a body of work that fused music with ideology, rhythm with resistance, and performance with protest. His music incurred the wrath of Nigeria's then-military regimes. In 1977, after the release of the album Zombie, which satirised government soldiers as obedient, brainless enforcers, his compound in the main city, Lagos, was raided. Known as Kalakuta Republic, the property was burned, residents were brutalised, and his mother, Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti, later died from injuries sustained during the assault. Rather than retreat, Fela Kuti responded through music and defiance. He took his mother's coffin to government offices and released the song Coffin for Head of State, turning grief into protest. The musician's ideology was a blend of pan-Africanism, anti-imperialism, and African-rooted socialism. Fela Kuti's mother was hugely influential in his life, helping shape his political consciousness, while the US-born singer and activist Sandra Izsadore helped sharpen his revolutionary outlook He was born Olufela Olusegun Oludoton Ransome-Kuti, but dropped Ransome because of its Western roots. In 1978, he married 27 women in a highly publicised ceremony, bringing together partners, performers, organisers and co-architects of the cultural and communal vision of Kalakuta Republic. Fela Kuti endured repeated arrests, beatings, censorship and surveillance by the security forces. Yet repression only amplified his influence. "He wasn't doing what he was doing to win awards. He was interested in liberation. Freeing the mind," Stein tells the BBC. "He was fearless. He was determined." Fela Kuti's musical evolution was shaped not only by Nigeria but also by Ghana. During the 1950s and 1960s, highlife music, pioneered by Ghanaian musicians such as ET Mensah, Ebo Taylor and Pat Thomas, became a defining sound across West Africa. Its melodic guitar lines, horn sections, dance rhythms, and cosmopolitan identity deeply influenced Fela Kuti's early musical direction. He spent time in Ghana absorbing highlife's structure, horn phrasing, and dance-oriented arrangements before fusing it with jazz, funk, the rhythms of his own Yoruba people, and political storytelling. The DNA of highlife can be heard in Afrobeat's melodic sensibility and its balance between groove and sophistication. In this sense, Afrobeat is not only Nigerian. It is West African, pan-African, and diasporic in origin, carrying Ghana's musical imprint at its foundation. On stage, Fela Kuti cut an unmistakable figure. Often bare-chested or draped in the wax-printed fabric popular across West Africa, hair shaped into a crisp Afro, saxophone in hand, eyes alert with intensity, he commanded a large band of more than 20 musicians. His performances at the Afrika Shrine in Lagos were legendary, part concert, part political rally, part spiritual ceremony. Stein recalls that performances at the Shrine were immersive rather than conventional. "When Fela played, nobody applauded," he tells the BBC. "The audience wasn't separate. They were part of it." Music was not spectacle. It was communion. Fela Kuti's visual identity was shaped in part by artist and designer Lemi Ghariokwu, who created 26 of his album covers between 1974 and 1993. "Fela has been an ancestor for 28 years. His legacy is growing by the day. This is immortality," Ghariokwu tells the BBC, welcoming the posthumous award. Today, Fela Kuti's music is still popular with millions around the world, and his influence is audible in modern artists such as Burna Boy, Kendrick Lamar and Sir Idris Elba. Elba is a huge fan - the award-winning actor and DJ has curated an official vinyl box set, Fela Kuti Box Set 6, and has publicly compared him to icons such as Sade and Frank Sinatra to illustrate the point that Fela Kuti has his own unique sound. Fela Kuti performed at major international festivals in Europe and North America, introducing global audiences to a bold and politically charged version of modern Africa. Seun Kuti was just 14 when his father died. "Fela never made me feel like I was a child," he recalls. "He didn't hide anything from me. He talked about everything openly." There was no myth-building. "I didn't even realise my dad was famous," he says. "That's credit to him. He kept me grounded." What stayed with him most was not spectacle, but discipline, clarity and humanity. "The human part of him, leadership, musicianship, fatherhood, that was the epitome of who he was." One of Seun Kuti's most revealing reflections speaks to independence and identity. "Fela was our dad, but you didn't own him. Fela belonged to himself. But we all belonged to him." Fela Kuti insisted on being addressed by name, not by title, even by his children. Seun recalls having his pocket money docked after calling him "Pops", a moment that carried a lesson in respect. "He always reminded us that he was in service to others more than himself." That ethic shaped Seun's evolution from youthful ambition toward cultural responsibility. "I used to make music to make money. But as I've grown, I lean more toward working for my people as well as my art." Fela Kuti led multiple ensembles, most famously Africa 70 and later Egypt 80, the latter now carried forward by his son. These were not conventional backing bands. They were musical militias, trained in discipline, endurance, and ideological purpose. Stein recalls Fela Kuti's obsessive attention to detail. "He tuned every instrument personally. Music wasn't entertainment to him. It was his mission."

### 4. [France moves to abolish concept of marital duty to have sex](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgjwxdz45ywo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

France moves to abolish concept of marital duty to have sex France is to enshrine in law the end of so-called "conjugal rights" – the notion that marriage means a duty to have sex. A bill approved on Wednesday in the National Assembly adds a clause to the country's civil code to make clear that "community of living" does not create an "obligation for sexual relations". The proposed law also makes it impossible to use lack of sexual relations as an argument in fault-based divorce. Though unlikely to have a major impact in the courts, supporters hope the law will help deter marital rape. "By allowing such a right or duty to persist, we are collectively giving our approval to a system of domination and predation by husband on wife," said the bill's sponsor, Green MP Marie-Charlotte Garin. "Marriage cannot be a bubble in which consent to sex is regarded as definitive and for life." The law will erase an ambiguity that has persisted despite there being no explicit mention of "conjugal duty" in any legal text. Currently, the French civil code defines the duties of marriage as "respect, fidelity, support and assistance," and it says that couples commit themselves to a "community of living". Nowhere in the texts is there any mention of "conjugal" - ie sexual - rights. The origins of that notion lie in medieval church law. However judges in modern divorce suits have, from time to time, given a broad interpretation to the concept of "community of living" to include sexual relations. In a famous case in 2019 a woman was found to have withheld sex from her husband for several years, and he was then granted a "fault-based" divorce implying guilt on her part. But the woman then took her case to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), which last year condemned France for allowing refusal of sex to be grounds for a fault-based divorce. This was hailed as an important advance by feminist campaigners. The ECHR's decision has made it, in practice, impossible for any French divorce judge to make a similar ruling - which is why the new law is mainly intended as a clarification, with the change unlikely to have a major impact on the courts. For campaigners, the notion that wives have a "duty" to agree to sex with their husbands is one that persists in parts of society and needs to be confronted. The Mazan trial of 2024 – where a drugged and unconscious Gisèle Pelicot was repeatedly raped by men invited by her husband - is seen as emblematic. Several defendants said they assumed her consent because of what her husband had told them. In France, as in most other countries, marital rape is now enshrined in law, where prior to 1990 men could argue that marriage implied consent. Since November last year the legal definition of rape in France has also been expanded to include the notion of non-consent. Previously, rape was defined as a sexual act carried out with "violence, constraint, threat or surprise". Now it is any act where there is no "informed, specific, anterior and revocable" consent. Silence or an absence of reaction do not imply consent, the law says.

**Excerpt**

Israeli media cite official accepting Hamas figure of 70,000 war dead Israeli media report that a senior security source has said the military accepts that more than 70,000 Palestinians have been killed during the war in Gaza. Israel has previously cast doubt on figures from the Hamas-run health ministry. But their figures have been deemed reliable by the UN and other human rights groups and widely cited by international media. The war began after the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, when about 1,200 other people were killed and 251 were taken hostage. Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 71,660 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. It says at least 492 Palestinians have been killed since a ceasefire began on 10 October 2025. Four Israeli soldiers have also been killed. Israel has always disputed the Hamas figures and said before last year's ceasefire it had killed 1,600 fighters since 7 October 2023 and another 22,000 combatants in the war. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) previously said it believed two or three civilians had been killed for every dead militant. Now a senior military source has indicated to Israeli journalists, including those from Haaretz and the Times of Israel, that the total number given by the Hamas health ministry is largely accurate, even though they have not been able to break down how many were combatants and how many died as a direct result of the fighting. Following the latest Israeli media reports, a military official said the details published did not reflect official IDF data. "Any publication or report on this matter will be released through official and orderly channels," the IDF official said.

Chips, anyone? German farm gives away millions of potatoes after bumper harvest A vast stockpile of potatoes is being given away for free by a farm in the German state of Saxony, after a bumper national harvest . Thousands of tasty tubers have been rolling into the country's capital, Berlin, since mid-January, with residents risking icy streets to bag their share. Dubbed "the great potato rescue" it is part of a plan to stop about 4 million kg (8.8 million lb) of surplus spuds from going to ruin. Food banks, schools and churches are among the beneficiaries, according to organisers. However, the enterprise was labelled a "disgusting PR stunt" by the Brandenburg Farmers' Association, which lamented the impact on local markets. Germany is the European Union's potato-producing capital, and last year's harvest has left the market saturated. Ultimately it is about "putting the potato in the spotlight as a valuable food," said Berliner Morgenpost editor, Peter Schink who helped spearhead the plan. The newspaper teamed up with eco-friendly search engine firm, Ecosia, to co-ordinate and fund the distribution of the spuds. Not wishing to discard its "magnificent tubers" back into the fields, Osterland Agrar says it's set to have bussed around 500,000kg to Berlin, and other parts of Germany and Ukraine. "We can store them until the middle of this year," said Hans-Joachim von Massow, Managing Director of Osterland Agrar, the agricultural firm that ended up with all the potatoes, after a customer contract was cancelled and settled. But not everyone is celebrating. "Food is and will remain valuable, even if thoughtless do-gooders throw around free potatoes at schools and churches," said Timo Scheib from the Brandenburg Farmers' Association. The BBC skidded optimistically along to a pickup spot at the city's de-commissioned airfield, Tempelhofer Feld, but there were no veggie sacks to be seen. And when we sheepishly asked a local resident about whether she'd noticed any "frei Kartoffeln" in the area she seemed slightly mystified, if not a little concerned for me. Nevertheless, as potatoes took off out of Saxony, so has the story, receiving media coverage in Germany and beyond. However we are told by Schink that the influx is, as things stand, set to wind down in Berlin as the funding is drying up. One more truckload can be expected once the weather is warm enough.

**Excerpt**

What did UK and China get out of Starmer's reset visit? Sir Keir Starmer's visit to China this week is the clearest sign yet the two countries are seeking to end the diplomatic "ice age" that has defined their relationship. Both leaders face economic pressures at home and are seeking new opportunities for trade and investment. For Sir Keir, the first UK prime minister to visit China since Theresa May in 2018, the trip was a chance to highlight the strength of British firms in finance, pharmaceuticals, healthcare, clean energy and car making. President Xi Jinping, meanwhile, aimed to show that China can be a reliable partner for Western economies, as US President Donald Trump continues to rattle the global trading system. Although no sweeping free trade deal was reached, the visit marked a cautious but tangible reset of UK–China economic ties. Agreements on visas, services, healthcare, green technology and finance, combined with revived dialogue, might lead to better access for British firms to Chinese markets and greater Chinese investment in the UK. What deals were agreed? The biggest commercial announcement came from AstraZeneca, which promised to invest $15bn (£11bn) in China over the next four years, to expand research and the manufacturing of medicines – the company's biggest investment in China to date. In the energy sector, British firm Octopus Energy is entering the Chinese market for the first time through a partnership with local company PCG Power to develop a digital platform for trading electricity. The project aims to improve efficiency in the power system and support China's efforts to increase the use of renewable energy. For Octopus, which has grown quickly in the UK, the deal allows entry into China's large and growing energy market, where demand for clean energy and digital trading is rising. Greg Jackson, CEO of Octopus Energy who was part of the UK's business delegation to China flagged that the country's scale and innovation have made solar, wind energy and batteries cheaper. "Now there's a huge opportunity for Britain to succeed as we build the solutions that use these products to cut the cost of electricity," he added. China also agreed to halve tariffs on Scotch whisky, a deal the UK government said could generate £250m for the British economy over the next five years. "Our whisky distilleries are the jewel in Scotland's crown," Sir Keir said. This is "proof that our pragmatic, hard-headed international engagement brings benefits at home", he added. Scotch whisky is a key export for Britain's drinks sector, with more than £5bn in annual exports. In recent years, China has been one of its fastest-growing markets. Industry groups welcomed the move, saying it would help Scottish distillers compete in a crowded market where US, European and Japanese firms are also vying for customers. Another outcome of the trip was visa-free travel for British citizens visiting China for up to 30 days for holidays and business, putting the UK on par with around 50 other countries, including France, Germany, Australia and Japan. Both sides also agreed to cooperate on disrupting migrant-smuggling networks, a top priority for Sir Keir's government. What does China get? For Beijing, renewed ties with the UK - a major European economy and close US ally - signal that China remains a dependable partner for the West despite Trump's trade tensions. Economically, the reset secures access for Chinese exporters of high-value goods such as electric vehicles, solar panels and clean energy, while creating opportunities for Chinese investment in British services, finance and green tech. Chinese state media framed the visit as a step toward turning the "potential of China–UK cooperation into real achievements that benefit both peoples and the world". British firms were also quick to emphasise the benefits for both countries through the expanded partnerships. "The prime minister's visit, the first in eight years, is a significant moment, signalling the importance of the economic relationship between the UK and China," Chris Fitzgerald, group director for international affairs at Octopus Energy told the BBC from China. "Such partnerships mean we can bring affordable, secure, clean energy to British customers... And we can use our technology and know-how to bring some of the same benefits to Chinese customers." What challenges remain? Foreign businesses have long complained about the difficulties of doing business in China, flagging red tape, complex regulations, and a lack of transparency. These can complicate investment decisions and create uncertainty for companies. "Any market has its own challenges, so of course we've got to be clear eyed and seek expert advice," Fitzgerald said. "We have had good discussions with the Chinese officials who have welcomed our entry. And we have been careful to choose an excellent partner... So we are excited to take the immense opportunity that the world's largest renewable energy market offers." Sir Keir's Labour government has struggled to deliver the economic growth it promised, making the China visit a high-stakes test. Despite scrutiny at home, improving relations with the world's second-largest economy has been a priority for the British prime minister. The move, however, requires a delicate diplomatic balancing act. US President Trump recently warned that Canada could face 100% tariffs over deals struck with China during Mark Carney's visit, and he has warned the UK about deepening its commercial ties with Beijing. Sir Keir has insisted that Britain does not need to choose between Washington and Beijing, framing the reset as a pragmatic way to support growth at home while managing geopolitical risk. At the UK–China Business Forum in Beijing on Friday, he described meetings with Xi as "very warm" and highlighted the significance of agreements on visa-free travel and whisky tariffs. These offer British firms "really important access" and are "symbolic of what we're doing with the relationship", he said. "That is the way that we build the mutual trust and respect that is so important." Sir Keir's visit is one of a flurry of trips to Beijing, as leaders from France, Canada and Finland seek to hedge against an increasingly unpredictable United States. With Washington pursuing aggressive tariff policies and even making threats over Greenland, these so-called middle powers are looking to diversify trade and investment partners while securing new markets. At the same time, these countries will be watching closely the deals that the UK, Canada, France and others are striking with China. They will all need to remain competitive in attracting Chinese investment and accessing the world's second largest economy.
