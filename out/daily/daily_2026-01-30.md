**Excerpt**

Schitt's Creek and Home Alone star Catherine O'Hara dies aged 71 Catherine O'Hara, the comedic actress best known for her starring roles in the Home Alone and Beetlejuice films, as well as her Emmy-winning turn in Schitt's Creek, has died aged 71. The Canadian star rose to fame through Toronto's Second City improvisation troupe and on SCTV, before making a name for herself in the US in 1988's Beetlejuice and as the matriarch in the holiday classic Home Alone. O'Hara, whose colleagues remembered her as a "wonderful person, artist and collaborator", who most recently appeared in the Emmy-winning comedy The Studio and HBO's The Last of Us. In a statement to the BBC, O'Hara's agent said she died on Friday at her home in Los Angeles following a brief illness. O'Hara made lightning strike twice in her career with indelible cinematic turns. In 1988's spooky satire Beetlejuice, she played Delia Deetz who led her possessed dinner guests in an enthralling song and dance performance of Day-O (the Banana Boat song). Two years later, in Home Alone, her panicked scream of "Kevin!" as she realises her mischievous eight-year-old son had been left behind during their Christmas holiday became is among the most memorable moments from one of the most successful film comedies ever. Her young co-star Macaulay Culkin, now 45, paid tribute to his on-screen mother on Friday, sharing images of the two of them from the film and in later years: "Mama. I thought we had time. I wanted more. I wanted to sit in a chair next to you. I heard you. But I had so much more to say. I love you. I'll see you later." The Toronto-born actress got her foot in the door as a waitress at the Toronto Second City theatre franchise in the 1970s, before auditioning for a role with the famed acting troupe. She further developed her comedic chops after joining the cast of sketch comedy show Second City Television (SCTV) - one of the most successful Canadian TV programmes ever - alongside the likes of Eugene Levy and the late John Candy. She has credited her Canadian roots with helping develop her sense of humour. In 2020, she told Rolling Stone that growing up Canadian didn't have the same sense of nationalism or patriotism that she saw in the US. "And that's a good thing because it does make you look outside of yourself and be aware of the world and not take yourself seriously," she said. "And I think Canadians have not only a sense of humour about others but also about themselves." Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney joined Canadians and fans across the world in mourning O'Hara. "Over 5 decades of work, Catherine earned her place in the canon of Canadian comedy — from the iconic Toronto production of Godspell to SCTV to Schitt's Creek," he said. "Canada has lost a legend." O'Hara also collaborated with Christopher Guest and co-writer Eugene Levy four times, including on the critically acclaimed mockumentary films Waiting for Guffman, Best in Show, A Mighty Wind and For Your Consideration. Her role as character actress Marilyn Hack in For Your Consideration earned her the 2006 National Board of Review Award for supporting actress. In a statement to Variety, Guest said he was devastated and that "we have lost one of the comic giants of our age". O'Hara had a late career surge thanks to the Canadian comedy series Schitt's Creek that became one of the biggest hits of the Covid lockdown. The fish-out-of-water comedy show followed the wealthy Rose family as they abruptly lose their money and mansion, and are forced to move into a shabby motel in a deadbeat town they bought as a joke. O'Hara's character Moira was a particular delight, with her wildly fluctuating accent, outlandish fashion sense, and brilliant one-liners, like "Never assume, Twyla, because when you assume, it makes an ass out of... both of us." Upon winning the Emmy Award for actress in a comedy, O'Hara thanked her co-stars Eugene and Dan Levy for giving her the opportunity to play "a woman of a certain age - my age - who gets to fully be her ridiculous self". She had continued working until very close to her death, playing a therapist in HBO's sci-fi drama The Last of Us and an ousted movie executive in Seth Rogen's The Studio just last year. In The Studio she played Patty Leigh, a studio boss replaced by Rogen's character, who pursues more creative roles as a film producer and makes her way to the Golden Globes - a stage that O'Hara was no stranger to. She won a Golden Globe award for best actress in 2021 for her role in Schitt's Creek and was nominated for her role in The Studio at this year's awards. She is also nominated at the Actor Awards (formerly the Screen Actors Guild Awards), which take place in March, for her role as Patty. O'Hara is survived by her husband Bo Welch and sons Matthew and Luke, as well as her siblings Michael O'Hara, Mary Margaret O'Hara, Maureen Jolley, Marcus O'Hara, Tom O'Hara, and Patricia Wallice.

### 2. [UN risks 'imminent financial collapse', secretary general warns](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr579mdv4m7o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

UN risks 'imminent financial collapse', secretary general warns The United Nations is at risk of "imminent financial collapse" due to member states not paying their fees, the body's head has warned. António Guterres said the UN faced a financial crisis which was "deepening, threatening programme delivery", and that money could run out by July. He wrote in a letter to all 193 member states that they had to honour their mandatory payments or overhaul the organisation's financial rules to avoid collapse. It comes after the UN's largest contributor, the US, refused to contribute to its regular and peacekeeping budgets, and withdrew from several agencies it called a "waste of taxpayer dollars". Several other members are in arrears or are simply refusing to pay. Though the UN General Assembly did approve a partial change to its financial system in late 2025, the organisation still faces a massive cash crisis compounded by a rule that means it is refunding money it never received. At its headquarters in Geneva, signs warning of the situation have been put up everywhere. In an almost desperate attempt to save cash, the escalators are regularly turned off and the heating turned down. Guterres wrote in his letter that the UN had faced financial crises in the past but that the current situation was "categorically different". "Decisions not to honour assessed contributions that finance a significant share of the approved regular budget have now been formally announced," the secretary general said, without naming specific members. He said the "integrity of the entire system" depended on states adhering to their obligation under the UN charter to pay their "assessed contributions" - adding that 77% of the total owed had been paid in 2025, leaving a record amount unpaid. Guterres said a rule that the UN must return unspent money on particular programmes to members if it could not implement a budget created a "double blow" in which it was "expected to give back cash that does not exist". "I cannot overstate the urgency of the situation we now face. We cannot execute budgets with uncollected funds, nor return funds we never received." As a result, the UN is now returning millions of dollars it never actually had. The letter reads: "Just this month, as part of the 2026 assessment, we were compelled to return $227m [£165m] – funds we have not collected." "The bottom line is clear," Guterres wrote. "Either all member states honour their obligations to pay in full and on time – or member states must fundamentally overhaul our financial rules to prevent an imminent financial collapse." UN agencies rarely get all the money they ask for to tackle humanitarian crises, but the past 12 months have been particularly difficult. The US is the UN's largest contributor, but President Donald Trump has said it was not fulfilling its "great potential" and has criticised it for failing to support US-led peace efforts. The US did not pay its contribution to the UN's regular budget in 2025 and offered only 30% of its expected funding to UN peacekeeping operations. Then in January, Trump withdrew it from dozens of international organisations, including 31 UN agencies, to "end American taxpayer funding and involvement in entities that advance globalist agendas over US priorities". In late December, the US pledged $2bn (£1.5bn) in funding for UN humanitarian programmes - warning the international organisation must "adapt or die" - a fraction of the $17bn it spent in 2022. Other countries, such as the UK and Germany, have also announced significant reductions in foreign aid, which will inevitably impact the UN's work. Guterres had warned earlier that same month that the UN faced its most fragile financial position in years - again citing unpaid fees - having said in October that it faced a "race to bankruptcy". Trump has separately been accused by critics of seeking to replace some functions of the UN with his Board of Peace to oversee regeneration efforts in Gaza. The US president has said its work would happen "in conjunction with the United Nations" - but when previously asked by a Fox TV journalist whether the board would take the UN's place, he replied: "Well, it might." The US officially left the UN's World Health Organization last week. It had refused to pay its 2024 and 2025 dues despite, WHO lawyers say, being legally obliged to do so. Other agencies are also making huge cuts. The UN's human rights office has warned that serious violations will now go undocumented because it lacks the funds to deploy investigators. In the past, their evidence has led to prosecutions for war crimes and crimes against humanity. In Afghanistan, which has one of the highest rates of maternal mortality in the world, UN Women has had to close mother and baby clinics. Meanwhile, the World Food Programme has had to cut rations to refugees fleeing the conflict in Sudan.

### 3. [Trump picks Kevin Warsh to lead the US Federal Reserve](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2d7yddrl2xo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

Trump picks Kevin Warsh to lead the US Federal Reserve US President Donald Trump has picked Kevin Warsh to lead the US Federal Reserve when current chairman Jerome Powell's four-year term ends in May. Warsh is a former Fed governor and was considered for chair during Trump's first term. He has been an outspoken Fed critic and is expected to support lower interest rates in the near term. The appointment comes amid mounting worries about the Fed's independence, following Trump's increasing attacks on Powell in recent months. Powell has angered Trump by not cutting interest rates quickly enough, and federal prosecutors recently opened a criminal investigation over testimony he gave to the Senate about renovations to Fed buildings. The Department of Justice (DoJ) probe prompted a forceful condemnation from Powell and messages of support from former Fed chairs and central bank heads. Warsh, who served as a Fed governor from 2006 to 2011, had re-emerged in recent weeks as a potential choice for the top job as speculation grew over who would replace the under-fire incumbent. Announcing the nomination on Truth Social, Trump said Warsh "will go down as one of the GREAT Fed Chairmen, maybe the best". Warsh's appointment still needs to be approved by the Senate, meaning it could face lengthy delays. If confirmed for the role, he will take the helm of the Fed at an unusually tense time, as economists and Wall Street investors monitor threats to the central bank's autonomy. Who is Kevin Warsh? Warsh, a 55-year-old economist, is a fellow at the right-leaning Hoover Institution and serves on the board of courier UPS. He has been an outspoken Fed critic, lambasting everything from the central bank's heavy reliance on data to its use of assets on its balance sheet. Warsh has escalated his rhetoric since emerging as a contender for the top Fed job, going as far as calling for "regime change". He had a relatively "hawkish" reputation as a Fed governor, meaning he tended to favour higher interest rates and took more seriously concerns about inflation. But he is now seen as a voice that would support lower rates in the near term. He has argued the Fed should shrink its balance sheet in order to bring down short-term interest rates, though some have questioned his logic. The Fed this week voted to hold interest rates steady, despite the White House pushing for a cut. Policymakers are continuing to monitor the effect on the economy of last year's trio of interest rate cuts. There are signs the US employment market is stabilising - job creation is sluggish but the unemployment rate has ticked lower. Inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target. "Warsh will have to convince his colleagues that rate cuts are appropriate this year, an argument that is unlikely to win unless the labour market shows renewed signs of weakening or inflationary pressures ease materially later this year," economists at Deutsche Bank wrote in a research note on Friday. Warsh also has close family connections to Trump's orbit. He is married to Jane Lauder, whose family is known for the Estee Lauder cosmetics group. His father-in-law, billionaire businessman Ronald Lauder, is a long-time Trump donor and ally. Republican Senator Thom Tillis, a member of the Senate Banking Committee, has said he will oppose Trump's nominees until the potential legal case against Powell is resolved. Trump has also taken aim at Fed governor Lisa Cook, whom he wants to remove. He has accused her of engaging in mortgage fraud, which she has denied. The Supreme Court is now assessing the case. Warsh had been seen of one of four leading candidates for the Fed job. The other frontrunners were White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett, Fed governor Christopher Waller and Wall Street bond guru Rick Rieder. When Warsh takes up his role, financial markets will keep a close eye on how independently he acts of President Trump. Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said Warsh "seems like a relatively safe choice". "Warsh's long-running hawkish views should help to counteract concerns that he might morph into a full-blown Trump stooge," he added. As news of Warsh's impending nomination started to leak out, the dollar strengthened slightly while the price of gold sank by 6%. Stuart Clark, portfolio manager at wealth management business Quilter, said investors would be "breathing somewhat of a sigh of relief" at Warsh's nomination. "Warsh was in contention for the job back in 2017 and as such comes to the role with a level of authority that is respected across the market," he added. "Concerns around Fed independence and an erosion on this should now be tempered, although Warsh's words and actions will be scrutinised by market participants intensely."

### 4. [Luigi Mangione will not face death penalty if convicted, judge rules](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c78egdg3r0po?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

Luigi Mangione will not face death penalty if convicted, judge rules Luigi Mangione, the man accused of gunning down UnitedHealthcare chief executive Brian Thompson, will not face the death penalty if convicted, a court has ruled. US District Judge Margaret Garnett dismissed the federal firearms charges against the 27-year-old that carried the possibility of the death penalty. He will still face stalking charges, which can bring a maximum punishment of life in prison. Mangione was arrested days after he allegedly shot Thompson as he walked into a New York City hotel on 4 December 2024. He has pleaded not guilty to all federal and state charges. After the ruling, Mangione's attorney Karen Agnifilo thanked the court for "this incredible decision", according to the BBC's US partner CBS News. "We're all very relieved," Agnifilo said. "We're prepared, and have been prepared, to fight this case, and we look forward to fighting this case." In her ruling, Judge Garnett, a Biden appointee, said two of the four federal charges did not "meet the federal statutory definition of a 'crime of violence' as matter of law". She noted that her decision was "solely to foreclose the death penalty as an available punishment to be considered by the jury". Garnett's ruling was a setback for the justice department, which had called Thompson's murder a "premeditated, cold-blooded assassination". The judge has given the government 30 days to challenge her decision to rule out the death penalty in the Mangione case. In a win for prosecutors, Garnett said they could present evidence to the jury from Mangione's backpack that he had at the time of his arrest at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania. Among the items in the bag were a gun, fake IDs and a notebook with writings that allegedly detailed Mangione's grievances against the US healthcare system. Defence attorneys had sought to dismiss that evidence from trial, arguing that authorities obtained it illegally without a warrant. Mangione, an Ivy League graduate from a wealthy Maryland family, is also facing nine charges in a separate case brought by New York state prosecutors, including second-degree murder. Father-of-two Thompson, 50, was shot from behind by a masked gunman as he walked to a Manhattan hotel for an annual investor conference. Investigators say the words "deny", "defend" and "depose" were written on shell casings found at the scene of Thompson's murder. Law enforcement sources say this may be a reference to the "three Ds of insurance" - tactics used by companies to reject payment claims by patients. Jury selection in the federal trial is due to begin on 8 September with opening statements due to start on 13 October. But state prosecutors are seeking to try Mangione as soon as July. In a separate incident, a Minnesota man was arrested on Wednesday for allegedly impersonating an FBI agent in an attempt to free Mangione from the Brooklyn jail where he is being held. The suspect - Mark Anderson - was carrying a barbecue fork and pizza cutter, prosecutors say. He is now being held at the same facility as Mangione.

**Excerpt**

Civil rights investigation opened into Alex Pretti shooting The Department of Justice (DOJ) has opened a civil rights investigation into the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by federal immigration agents, the US deputy attorney general has said. Todd Blanche said he did not want to "overstate" the move, calling it "a standard investigation by the FBI when there are circumstances like what we saw". The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said the FBI would lead the investigation into Pretti's shooting in Minneapolis, with support from the DOJ's Civil Rights Division. His death came just weeks after Renee Good was shot dead by federal officers in the same city. "We're looking at everything that would shed light on that day," Blanche told a news conference. He added the investigation would "to the extent it needs to" involve lawyers at the civil rights division. The investigation was previously being led by the Homeland Security Investigations branch of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the BBC's US partner CBS News reported. Two agents involved in Pretti's shooting have been placed on administrative leave while the incident is investigated, the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said on Thursday. According to a preliminary DHS report sent to Congress, two officers fired their weapons at Pretti during a scuffle. Initial official accounts had alleged Pretti brandished his gun. The 37-year-old intensive care nurse, who was a US citizen, is understood to have joined protests in the city after Renee Good was shot dead by an ICE agent in Minneapolis on 7 January. Their deaths sparked fresh demonstrations in the state, and prompted public outcry across the US and criticism from lawmakers in both parties. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey have called for federal agents to be withdrawn entirely from the state's capital region. The state has also asked a federal judge to stop Operation Metro Surge, the DHS's immigration enforcement initiative which began on 1 December and involves some 3,000 officers. President Donald Trump has said his administration is "going to de-escalate a little bit" in Minnesota, while his border tsar Tom Homan said on Thursday that the administration planned to "draw down" federal forces if local officials co-operated. "We are not surrendering our mission at all. We're just doing it smarter," Homan told a news conference in Minneapolis, without specifying what form a de-escalation might take.

**Excerpt**

Iran wants to make deal rather than face military action, Trump says President Donald Trump has said Iran wants to make a deal rather than face US military action, despite Tehran's insistence that its missile and defence systems will "never" be up for negotiation. "I can say this, they do want to make a deal," Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday when asked about a build-up of US military forces in the Gulf, without providing details. He had warned Tehran on Wednesday that time was "running out" to negotiate a deal on its nuclear programme after a large US naval fleet had gathered near the country. Iran's foreign minister said there were no talks planned with the US at present but that Tehran was open to negotiations based on "mutual respect" and trust. Also on Friday, the Kremlin said the head of the Iran's Supreme National Security Council Ali Larijani had met Russian President Vladimir Putin. They discussed "Middle Eastern and international issues" among other matters, state news agency Ria-Novosoti reported. Iran insists its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful and has repeatedly denied accusations by the US and its allies that it is seeking to develop nuclear weapons. Asked on Friday whether he had given Tehran a deadline by which to strike a deal, Trump said that "only they know for sure". He told reporters: "Hopefully we'll make a deal. If we do make a deal, that's good. If we don't make a deal, we'll see what happens." He said a large "Armada" was on its way to the region and declined to give a timeline for its withdrawal: "We'll see how it all works out. They have to float someplace, so they might as well float near Iran." Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi had said earlier that the country's missile defence systems would "never" be on the negotiating table, and repeated the government's position that its nuclear programme was peaceful. At a press conference with his Turkish counterpart after talks in Istanbul to avert US action, he said preparations were needed for "fair and just negotiations". Trump's warning regarding a nuclear deal on Wednesday came after he had promised Washington would intervene to help those involved in a brutal crackdown on protests in the country earlier this month. He had said help was "on the way", before saying he had been told the execution of demonstrators had stopped. On Thursday, he said he had told Iran that it had to do two things to avoid military action: "Number one, no nuclear. And number two, stop killing protesters." The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) said it had confirmed the killing of more than 6,300 people, including more than 5,900 protesters, since the unrest began at the end of December. It said it was also investigating another 17,000 reported deaths received despite an internet shutdown after nearly three weeks. Another group, the Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR), has warned the final toll could exceed 25,000.

**Excerpt**

Mali lawmaker jailed in Ivory Coast for insulting president A Malian lawmaker has been jailed in neighbouring Ivory Coast for three years for insulting the 84-year-old Ivorian leader, who recently won a fourth term in office. Mamadou Hawa Gassama, who serves in the transitional parliament set up by Mali's junta, was arrested last July while on a trip to Ivory Coast. Prosecutors said he described President Alassane Ouattara as a "tyrant", "an enemy of Mali" and strongly criticised his leadership in interviews and on social media. Since Mali's military took power in 2020, relations with Ivory Coast have been strained. Ouattara, an ally of France - the former colonial power in both nations - has been critical of the takeover and other coups in West Africa. Since the Malian politician's arrest in Abidjan last July, the authorities in Bamako have not commented on the case. "We believe that this decision is... excessive... it is very severe," the AFP news agency quotes Gassama's lawyer Mamadou Ismaila Konate as saying. Prosecutors argued that Gassama's remarks went beyond political critique, accusing him of deliberately seeking to undermine Ivorian institutions and sow discord between the two neighbours. It is a reminder of the diplomatic row that blew up two years after the coup, when 49 Ivorian soldiers were sentenced in Mali to 20 years in prison for undermining state security. At the time Ivory Coast denied the allegation and said they had been sent to Mali as part of a UN mission fighting militant Islamists. They were freed after mediation efforts led by Togo. Since then, Mali's military leaders have overseen the exit of the UN peacekeeping mission and French forces, which had deployed to Mali in 2013 to help deal with an escalating jihadist insurgency. Instead it has sought closer ties with Russia - and Russian mercenaries have been brought in to deal with the insecurity affecting several countries in the vast Sahel region.

**Excerpt**

Ukraine sees quieter night as Trump says Putin will not attack its cities Ukraine has seen a relatively quiet night after Donald Trump said his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin had agreed not to attack Kyiv and "various towns" during a cold snap. The Kremlin confirmed it had agreed to cease attacks on Kyiv until Sunday to "create favourable conditions" for peace talks. While the US president did not say when the pause would begin, air raid alerts sounded in just eight Ukrainian regions overnight into Friday, with two minor injuries recorded in Zaporizhzhia. Temperatures in the capital, Kyiv, are due to plummet to -24C (-11F) over the coming days. Russia has recently intensified attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, as it has during cold periods since its invasion began. Ukrainian officials had been expecting a major attack this weekend ahead of the current cold spell - if that does not take place, it could mark a significant step in US-led efforts to bring the war to a close. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday that Putin had called a halt to strikes on Kyiv "for a week until 1 February" at the personal request of Trump. That date is just two days away. He made no mention of the cold weather and refused to be drawn on whether Russia would refrain from targeting energy infrastructure, instead portraying the agreement as an effort to facilitate US-mediated peace negotiations. While the last few nights have been quiet for the capital, there have been 530 air raid alerts in Kyiv this week, according to one monitor. Ukraine's air force said more than 100 drones and a ballistic missile were fired at regions near the front line overnight. But, as of Friday morning, there have been no fresh attacks on electricity or heating infrastructure crucial for keeping people warm. Trump told a televised cabinet meeting in Washington DC on Thursday: "I personally asked President Putin not to fire into Kyiv and the various towns for a week, and he agreed to do that." He added: "It was very nice. A lot of people said, 'Don't waste the call, you're not going to get that.' And he [Putin] did it." The US president said of the Ukrainians: "Almost they didn't believe it, but they were very happy about it because they are struggling badly." Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky later wrote on social media that Trump had made an "important statement" about "the possibility of providing security for Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities during this extreme winter period". He told reporters on Friday that there had been no "direct dialogue or agreement" with Russia to pause attacks on energy infrastructure, but that Kyiv would act in kind if Moscow did so. Ukraine has targeted oil depots and refineries within Russia in a bid to limit its ability to finance its invasion. Meanwhile, residents of Kyiv who spoke to the BBC expressed scepticism about the deal between Trump and Putin. "I don't believe that Putin will stop even for a week," said Olena. "We have seen so many talks and deals but, nevertheless, he continues to do what he wants." She added: "We have survived -20C recently, and if air strikes decrease even a little, then we'll overcome the next week as well." Meanwhile, Hennadiy said he too did not believe Russia would stop targeting Kyiv's energy infrastructure, but expressed hope that it would. "If we get a one-week respite, it will be good," he said. "These days, -30C is a catastrophe for us. Before it was OK and we could cope." Russian, Ukrainian and US negotiators met in the United Arab Emirates last week for the first trilateral talks since the war began in 2022. All sides described the talks as constructive, but while Zelensky said Russia pausing its attacks for the duration of the cold snap had been discussed, no agreement was announced. Instead, attacks continued, crippling the power supply to major Ukrainian cities, leaving millions without heating or electricity. Kyiv's Mayor Vitaly Klitschko has said 378 apartment blocks in the capital remain without heating. Electrical companies have been carrying out round-the-clock repairs, but their work can be quickly undone by Russian air attacks. Even when power is restored, the supply only lasts a few hours - enough to charge appliances but not to substantially warm up homes. A second round of peace talks was scheduled to take place in Abu Dhabi on Sunday, but may now be postponed and relocated due to "what's happening between America and Iran", Zelensky said. Trump has threatened Tehran with military action over a crackdown on nationwide protests that human rights monitors say have led to thousands of deaths, as well as its nuclear programme. Negotiations on a peace plan have been mediated by the US for months, with a key sticking point being Ukraine ceding territory to Russia. Moscow currently controls around a fifth of Ukraine, including most of the eastern Donbas region. It wants Kyiv to hand over the areas of the Donbas it has not yet taken by force, while Ukraine reportedly wants Russia to hand back control of its largest nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia. "We are not ready for compromises that violate territorial integrity," Zelensky said on Friday. "We will not hand Donbas or the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to the Russians without a fight."

**Excerpt**

Syrian government reaches deal with Kurdish-led forces Syria's government has reached a deal with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) militia alliance that would see the gradual intergration of Kurdish forces and institutions into the state. This comes after weeks of clashes which saw Syrian troops reclaim large swathes of territory in the north-east that had been under SDF control for more than a decade. US envoy Tom Barrack called it "a profound and historic milestone in Syria's journey toward national reconciliation, unity, and enduring stability". Earlier this month - and after its major territorial losses - the SDF agreed to a ceasefire that saw much of its hold brought under government control, but reports of clashes continued. Much like that 14-point agreement, Friday's deal would see SDF withdraw from points of contact, its members join the Syrian army and government, and the integration of its administrative and civil bodies into those of the state. The SDF said the agreement also includes the formation of a military division consisting of three brigades made of its members. The statement on X added that an agreement on the civil and educational rights for Kurdish people was also reached, as well as a guarantee that those displaced would be allowed to return to their homes. Part of the deal saw the transfer of prisons, oil and gas fields - which were under SDF control - to Damascus. Syrian troops seized control of the Omar facility, the country's largest oilfield, after the SDF pulled back. Earlier, the army took the strategic Tabqa dam on the Euphrates river. The Kurds previously controlled nearly a third of Syria's territory with the support of the US after it helped defeat the Islamic State (IS) group. Their recent losses mark the biggest change of control in the country since the toppling of former leader Bashar al-Assad in December 2024, which ended Syria's 13-year civil war. Since leading the rebel offensive that overthrew the Assad regime, Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa has vowed to reunify a divided Syria. After the ceasefire was agreed on 18 January, he said he hoped it would allow the country to "end its state of division and move to a state of unity and progress". Sharaa also issued a decree recognising Kurdish cultural, linguistic and civil rights by making Kurdish a national language, granting nationality to stateless Kurds, and declaring their new year a national holiday. This is the first formal recognition of Kurdish national rights since Syria's independence in 1946. This agreement followed months of stalled negotiations over a March 2025 integration deal, which both sides had accused each other of trying to derail.

Three reasons for the record rise in gold prices, and one why they are falling Gold prices have reached record highs recently, with investors piling money into the safe haven asset amid rising global political uncertainty. The metal surged past the $5,000 (£3,646) per ounce mark for the first time on Monday and briefly hit $5,500. Silver and platinum prices also saw similar rises. All have since fallen sharply after signs of political stability in the US, though they remain much higher than this time last year. Trump uncertainty shifting investment Global trade has been upset by tariffs introduced by US President Donald Trump on countries who wish to trade with the US but whom he sees as unfavourable. His trade policies continue to worry investors, helping to drive the gold rally, says Emma Wall, chief investment strategist at Hargreaves Lansdown. In January, gold and silver prices hit record highs, but share prices fell as investors reacted to Trump's threat of fresh tariffs on eight European countries opposed to his proposed takeover of Greenland. Hamad Hussain, an economist at Capital Economics, said the perception gold is a safe investment, in contrast with the risks associated with US foreign and fiscal policies under Trump, has put the precious metal "in the spotlight". War and Greenland threats add to uncertainty Wars in Ukraine and Gaza have added to a climate of general political uncertainty. The US seizure of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro also pushed the gold price to blockbuster levels. Trump's Greenland threats heightened global political tensions and saw confidence in the US dollar plummet, with investors turning to precious metals as a safer investment. The biggest hit the dollar has faced during Trump's tenure was in the aftermath of his so-called "Liberation Day" tariffs, announced last spring. "Gold is doing what it does best when the world feels messy, jumping amid rising trade tensions, geopolitical flare-ups, political uncertainty in the US," Wall says. "Fresh friction between the US, Canada and China, unease around Europe and the Middle East, and even shutdown risks in Washington have all added to gold's appeal." Central bank buying Central banks buying gold has been a key factor pushing up its price. "Investors and global central banks have... favoured gold as their reserve currency of choice, which they believe insulates them from US policy dependence," says Wall. "Certain nations will have observed the threat of Russia having its US dollar assets seized by global players supportive of Ukraine, and subsequently considered the metal a more attractive neutral reserve," she added. But while central banks are still buying more gold than before 2022, Hussain says, estimates suggest that demand actually softened in 2025. Other buyers of gold include China, which is the biggest buyer of gold, with demand in the country coming from individuals buying jewellery as well as investors. Investors in the west are also huge buyers of gold, with money flowing into firms on the stock market that own and trade gold. Hussein also says new buyers in the market have been picking up huge amounts of gold, adding to its dramatic rise recently. One example was Tether, a digital currency specialist which has recently purchased so much gold its reserves reportedly outsize those of some small countries. Why has the price of gold and silver fallen in recent days? Gold prices had been soaring to record highs in recent days, partly driven by fears Trump would choose a Fed chairman who would cave into his demands to cut interest rates, leading to a falling dollar and rising inflation. Buying gold is a strategy to protect against those things. But, as reports emerged the president would nominate Kevin Warsh, who is seen as a relatively safe bet compared with other candidates, gold, silver, and plantinum prices all slumped. However, precious metal prices are still much higher than this time last year because of ongoing geopolitical tensions, current tariffs and further tariff threats from Trump, and ongoing conflicts around the world. It means the shine of gold and silver feels more attractive than ever for investors seeking "safe haven" assets. One of gold's biggest appeals is its relative scarcity. Nicholas Frappell, global head of institutional markets at ABC Refinery, told the BBC: "When you own gold, it's not attached to the debt of somebody else like a bond is or an equity where the performance of a company will drive performance. "It's a really good diversifier in a very uncertain world." Friday's gold price volatility shows its value can fall almost as quickly as it rises, like all traded commodities.

**Excerpt**

Will Trump's pick to lead US central bank get him the change he wants? Donald Trump has been calling for change at the US central bank. Now, with Jerome Powell's term as Federal Reserve chairman poised to end in May, he could be about to get his wish. On Friday, the US president announced Kevin Warsh - a conservative whom he had passed over for the post, to his regret, during his first term - as his choice to replace Powell. "Warsh "is 'central casting' and he will never let you down," Trump declared on social media as he announced the decision. The irony of the choice was lost on no one. Warsh has made his name as a supporter of higher interest rates - a reputation he has tried to shed in recent opinion articles and media appearances. It's a position that would seem to put him at odds with Trump, a self-described "low interest rate guy", who has criticised Powell for not cutting interest rates quickly enough and who has made no secret that his choice to lead the Fed should be on board with his views. It remains to be seen whether Warsh's selection will lead to the bank Trump wants. Warsh brings a traditional background to the job: an Ivy League education, a prior stint at the Fed, as well as time on Wall Street and at the Hoover Institution - a conservative economic think tank. Supporters say he is sensitive to concerns about the bank's independence and alert to the risks if its policies serve short-term political aims rather than the wider economy. Lee Ohanian, an economics professor at UCLA and senior fellow at the right-leaning Hoover Institution, who has known Warsh for years, said taking directions from Trump "would diminish the Fed. It would diminish the office of the chairman, and it would create tremendous turmoil in the financial markets. Kevin knows that". In Congress and on Wall Street, where Trump's attacks on Powell have caused alarm, Warsh's potential independent streak is seen as a plus. His nomination has drawn praise from establishment figures including former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and Mohamed el-Erian, a high-profile economist with a long career on Wall Street. Critics have questioned whether it is the fact that Warsh's father-in-law, Ronald Lauder, is a Trump donor and friend that got him the job. Others say his record as a policymaker is poor, noting that Warsh opposed economic stimulus during the 2008 financial crisis as he fretted the policies would lead to inflation – a minority view then and now. Congressman Don Beyer, a Democrat from Virginia, accused Warsh of showing "willingness to wildly alter his views...based on who is in the White House". But on balance, many in financial circles see him as a responsible pick. "There appears to be at least some degree of comfort with a Warsh-led Fed vs. the other choices," Wells Fargo analysts said on Friday - noting that his relatively sparse public profile in recent years implies a degree of uncertainty. "Investors should be thankful," Jeffrey Roach, chief economist for LPL Financial, told the BBC. What Warsh could mean for interest rates? The acceptance of Warsh is partially a gamble that a Fed with him in charge might not change much. After all, despite Trump's complaints, the Fed cut interest rates three times last year and most analysts expect additional cuts this year – regardless of what Trump thinks. That's good news for borrowers in the US, who may see lower rates on mortgages, car loans and other kinds of debt - and maybe for the president too, if this makes people feel better about the economy. It also means Warsh does not necessarily have to surrender his credibility as an independent economist to deliver lower interest rates for Trump. 'Mission creep' at the Fed Where differences might be felt more is in other parts of the Fed, which Warsh has accused of "mission creep" and taking on too big a role in the economy. He wants to reduce its role in bank regulation and cut back study of issues like climate change - putting him in alignment with the White House. He, like Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, is a fierce critic of the interventions the Fed made in markets after the 2008 financial crisis and again during the Covid-19 pandemic, which has left the bank with huge holdings of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. Warsh maintains these policies prop up the stock market and other assets - benefiting the wealthy and big financial interests rather than the mainstream economy - and has called for reducing those holdings and coordinating their management more closely with the Treasury Department. Whether he would actually lead the Fed to shrink its balance sheet more quickly than the bank has been doing is unclear. One effect of doing so could be higher borrowing costs - exactly the opposite of what Trump wants to see. On Friday, gold prices dropped and the dollar gained, suggesting traders see Warsh as likely to stick to his initial instincts as a "hawk" who favours higher interest rates. Narayana Kocherlakota, a finance professor at the University of Rochester, who served on the Fed with Warsh, said he thinks he would go against the president if conditions called for it. "He's very smart and he's very independent. And I think that's the kind of person that Americans should want at the head of their central bank," Kocherlakota said. Others argue Warsh's thinking on the economy has evolved to be closely aligned with Trump, including downplaying concerns that rapid growth and rising wages could fuel inflation. "Warsh is not the Fed's guy, he is Trump's guy, and has shadowed Trump on monetary policy almost every step of the way since 2009," wrote Thierry Wizman, global foreign exchange and rates strategist at Macquarie Group. For now, Warsh may look like the candidate most likely to satisfy all parties. But Trump's swift turn on Powell - his last pick for Fed chair - should serve as a cautionary reminder.

**Excerpt**

Music legend Fela Kuti becomes first African to get Grammys Lifetime Achievement Award Long crowned by his legion of fans as the king of Afrobeat, the late Fela Kuti is finally being recognised by the global music industry. The Nigerian star will posthumously receive a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Grammys - almost three decades after his death at the age of 58. "Fela has been in the hearts of the people for such a long time. Now the Grammys have acknowledged it, and it's a double victory," his musician son Seun Kuti tells the BBC. "It's bringing balance to a Fela story," he adds. Rikki Stein, a long-time friend and manager of the late musician, says the recognition by the Grammys is "better late than never". "Africa hasn't in the past rated very highly in their interests. I think that's changing quite a bit of late," Stein tells the BBC. Following the global success of Afrobeats, a genre inspired by Fela's sound, the Grammys introduced the category of Best African Performance in 2024. This year, Nigerian superstar Burna Boy also has a nomination in the Best Global Music Album category. But Fela Kuti will be the first African to receive a Lifetime Achievement Award, albeit posthumously. The award was first presented in 1963 to American singer and actor Bing Crosby. Other musicians who will receive the award this year include Mexican-American guitarist Carlos Santana, Chaka Khan, the American singer known as the Queen of Funk, and Paul Simon. Fela Kuti's family, as well friends and colleagues, will be attending the Grammys to receive his award. "The global human tapestry needs this, not just because it's my father," Seun Kuti tells the BBC. Stein says it is important to recognise Fela as a man who championed the cause of people who had "drawn life's short straw", adding that he "castigated any form of social injustice, corruption [and] mismanagement" in government. "So it would be impossible to ignore that aspect of Fela's legacy," he tells the BBC. For Fela Anikulapo Kuti was not simply a musician, but also a cultural theorist, political agitator and the undisputed architect of Afrobeat - which is distinct from, but ultimately led to, the modern sound of Afrobeats. He pioneered the Afrobeat genre alongside drummer Tony Allen, blending West African rhythms, jazz, funk, highlife, extended improvisation, call-and-response vocals and politically charged lyricism. Across a career spanning roughly three decades until his death in 1997, Fela Kuti released more than 50 albums and built a body of work that fused music with ideology, rhythm with resistance, and performance with protest. His music incurred the wrath of Nigeria's then-military regimes. In 1977, after the release of the album Zombie, which satirised government soldiers as obedient, brainless enforcers, his compound in the main city, Lagos, was raided. Known as Kalakuta Republic, the property was burned, residents were brutalised, and his mother, Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti, later died from injuries sustained during the assault. Rather than retreat, Fela Kuti responded through music and defiance. He took his mother's coffin to government offices and released the song Coffin for Head of State, turning grief into protest. The musician's ideology was a blend of pan-Africanism, anti-imperialism, and African-rooted socialism. Fela Kuti's mother was hugely influential in his life, helping shape his political consciousness, while the US-born singer and activist Sandra Izsadore helped sharpen his revolutionary outlook He was born Olufela Olusegun Oludoton Ransome-Kuti, but dropped Ransome because of its Western roots. In 1978, he married 27 women in a highly publicised ceremony, bringing together partners, performers, organisers and co-architects of the cultural and communal vision of Kalakuta Republic. Fela Kuti endured repeated arrests, beatings, censorship and surveillance by the security forces. Yet repression only amplified his influence. "He wasn't doing what he was doing to win awards. He was interested in liberation. Freeing the mind," Stein tells the BBC. "He was fearless. He was determined." Fela Kuti's musical evolution was shaped not only by Nigeria but also by Ghana. During the 1950s and 1960s, highlife music, pioneered by Ghanaian musicians such as ET Mensah, Ebo Taylor and Pat Thomas, became a defining sound across West Africa. Its melodic guitar lines, horn sections, dance rhythms, and cosmopolitan identity deeply influenced Fela Kuti's early musical direction. He spent time in Ghana absorbing highlife's structure, horn phrasing, and dance-oriented arrangements before fusing it with jazz, funk, the rhythms of his own Yoruba people, and political storytelling. The DNA of highlife can be heard in Afrobeat's melodic sensibility and its balance between groove and sophistication. In this sense, Afrobeat is not only Nigerian. It is West African, pan-African, and diasporic in origin, carrying Ghana's musical imprint at its foundation. On stage, Fela Kuti cut an unmistakable figure. Often bare-chested or draped in the wax-printed fabric popular across West Africa, hair shaped into a crisp Afro, saxophone in hand, eyes alert with intensity, he commanded a large band of more than 20 musicians. His performances at the Afrika Shrine in Lagos were legendary, part concert, part political rally, part spiritual ceremony. Stein recalls that performances at the Shrine were immersive rather than conventional. "When Fela played, nobody applauded," he tells the BBC. "The audience wasn't separate. They were part of it." Music was not spectacle. It was communion. Fela Kuti's visual identity was shaped in part by artist and designer Lemi Ghariokwu, who created 26 of his album covers between 1974 and 1993. "Fela has been an ancestor for 28 years. His legacy is growing by the day. This is immortality," Ghariokwu tells the BBC, welcoming the posthumous award. Today, Fela Kuti's music is still popular with millions around the world, and his influence is audible in modern artists such as Burna Boy, Kendrick Lamar and Sir Idris Elba. Elba is a huge fan - the award-winning actor and DJ has curated an official vinyl box set, Fela Kuti Box Set 6, and has publicly compared him to icons such as Sade and Frank Sinatra to illustrate the point that Fela Kuti has his own unique sound. Fela Kuti performed at major international festivals in Europe and North America, introducing global audiences to a bold and politically charged version of modern Africa. Seun Kuti was just 14 when his father died. "Fela never made me feel like I was a child," he recalls. "He didn't hide anything from me. He talked about everything openly." There was no myth-building. "I didn't even realise my dad was famous," he says. "That's credit to him. He kept me grounded." What stayed with him most was not spectacle, but discipline, clarity and humanity. "The human part of him, leadership, musicianship, fatherhood, that was the epitome of who he was." One of Seun Kuti's most revealing reflections speaks to independence and identity. "Fela was our dad, but you didn't own him. Fela belonged to himself. But we all belonged to him." Fela Kuti insisted on being addressed by name, not by title, even by his children. Seun recalls having his pocket money docked after calling him "Pops", a moment that carried a lesson in respect. "He always reminded us that he was in service to others more than himself." That ethic shaped Seun's evolution from youthful ambition toward cultural responsibility. "I used to make music to make money. But as I've grown, I lean more toward working for my people as well as my art." Fela Kuti led multiple ensembles, most famously Africa 70 and later Egypt 80, the latter now carried forward by his son. These were not conventional backing bands. They were musical militias, trained in discipline, endurance, and ideological purpose. Stein recalls Fela Kuti's obsessive attention to detail. "He tuned every instrument personally. Music wasn't entertainment to him. It was his mission."
