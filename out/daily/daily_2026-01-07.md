Aldrich Ames, CIA agent who sold secrets to the Soviets, dies aged 84 Aldrich Ames, a CIA officer who became one of America's most damaging double agents, has died aged 84. The former counterintelligence officer, who was serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole, died on Monday at the Federal Correctional Institution in Cumberland, Maryland, CBS News, the BBC's media partner in the US, reported. Ames was jailed on 28 April 1994 after he admitted to selling secret information to the Soviet Union and later Russia. He compromised more than 100 clandestine operations and divulged the identities of more than 30 agents spying for the West - leading to the deaths of at least 10 CIA intelligence assets. Seeking money to pay debts, Ames said he began providing the KGB with the names of CIA spies in April 1985, receiving an initial payment of $50,000. Known to the KGB by his code name, Kolokol (The Bell), Ames went on to identify virtually all of the CIA's spies in the Soviet Union, for which he was well rewarded. "To my enduring surprise, the KGB replied that it had set aside for me $2 million in gratitude for the information," he said in an eight-page statement he read to the court. Over the course of nine years, Ames admitted receiving a total of about $2.5 million from the Soviet Union for his betrayal of the US. The cash fuelled a lavish lifestyle, with Ames splashing out on a new Jaguar car, foreign holidays and a $540,000 house - despite never having a salary of more than $70,000 a year. Ames's 31-year career at the CIA began when his father, an analyst at the CIA, helped him land a job there after dropping out of college in 1962. He married his first wife, fellow CIA agent Nancy Segebarth, in 1969, before being sent to Turkey as a counterintelligence officer to recruit foreign agents. Three years later, he was brought back to the US, where his problems with alcohol began to emerge and his marriage began to collapse. Despite several security violations over the years, including leaving a briefcase full of classified information on a subway, Ames was then sent to Mexico City in 1981. There he met his second wife, Maria del Rosario Casas Dupuy, a cultural attaché at the Colombian embassy and a CIA asset who would later be charged as his accomplice. Returning to the US in 1983, Ames became head of the CIA's Soviet counterintelligence department - despite continuing concerns over his drinking. While his career was soaring, his personal life was spiralling. As well as paying monthly support to his first wife, he was also funding Rosario's lifestyle, including her love of shopping. It was his escalating debts that led him to selling the wealth of secrets that he had access to. "It was about the money, and I don't think he ever really tried to lead anybody to believe it was anything more than that," FBI agent Leslie G Wiser, who was involved in the investigation that led to Ames's arrest, told the BBC's Witness History in 2015. His treachery began in 1985 when he gave the Soviets the names of a few KGB officers secretly working for the FBI in exchange for $50,000. His espionage continued for the following nine years, until his arrest on 21 February 1994, after a mole hunt that had started closing in the year before. Ames cooperated with the authorities in exchange for a plea deal that secured a lenient sentence for Rosario, who admitted she had known about the money and his meetings with the Soviets. She was released after five years. The CIA director at the time, R. James Woolsey, described Ames as "a malignant betrayer of his country". Woolsey said the agents Ames betrayed died because a "murdering traitor wanted a bigger house and a Jaguar".

**Excerpt**

An Indian state wants to tackle hate speech with a law - can it work? Can a law help curb hate speech in India? That's what the southern state of Karnataka is betting on. Last month, legislators passed a bill which aims to prevent hate speech and hate crimes that fuel communal tension or target individuals and groups. Hate speech is not new in India, but it has intensified in recent years as social media has spread and television channels amplify comments and reactions. A report last year found hate speech against minorities - mainly Muslims - rose 74% in 2024, peaking during the national elections. That's why the Karnataka government - led by the Congress party - says the move is necessary, arguing that hate speech can lead to real-life violence. But critics warn this could come at the cost of civil liberties and free speech. The Karnataka Hate Speech and Hate Crimes (Prevention) Bill, 2025, which still needs the state governor's sign to become law, sets out how hate speech cases should be investigated and prosecuted. It defines hate speech as any "expression which is made, published, or circulated… in public view" verbally, in print, television or social media. But it also defines a hate crime as the "communication of hate speech", without specifying whether it needs to lead to violence or not. The bill gives the state government the power to order social media and digital platforms to take down content it deems hate speech, something only the federal government can do currently. India doesn't have a federal law against hate speech but a number of provisions across laws prohibit certain forms of speech, writing and actions as exceptions to free speech. This includes criminalisation of acts that could promote "enmity between different groups on grounds of religion" and "deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs". The BJP, which governs nationally but is in the opposition in Karnataka, has said that bringing in a separate law is unnecessary. But Karnataka home minister G Parameshwara told the assembly the bill would close loopholes in existing law, making hate speech and hate crimes non-bailable and giving the state wider powers to act. It also raises punishments. If passed into law, those convicted of hate crimes would face non-bailable jail terms of one to seven years and fines of 50,000 rupees ($550; £410), with tougher penalties for repeat offenders. The chief minister of neighbouring Telangana state, also governed by the Congress, has said that they will introduce a similar bill as well. The BJP, often accused of coming down sharply on dissent nationally and in states it governs, has been protesting against the bill, saying it could curb free speech. "Through this law, the state government is taking away people's right to free speech guaranteed by the constitution, and putting opposition leaders and the media behind bars," opposition leader R Ashoka told the assembly. Legal experts and free speech activists echo the concerns. Supreme Court lawyer Sanjay Hegde warns that the law could be misused by political parties across the spectrum. "One party's hate speech is another man's political propaganda and vice versa. Just because you dislike some speech, it does not become hate speech," he says. Alok Prasanna Kumar, advocate and co-founder of Vidhi Centre for Legal policy, says that while the intent behind the law might be good, there is "enormous scope for misuse". The debate has also raised a more fundamental issue around how hate speech and crime are defined by law. "It is an attempt by a state to define hate speech as a term in the law, which expands beyond existing provisions on promoting enmity and outraging religious feelings, to include speech targeting caste, religion and other identities," said Siddharth Narrain, assistant professor at National Law School of India University. However, he says the bill blurs the line between hate speech and hate crime. Hate speech, he argues, should be prosecuted because it can lead to violence, but the current wording treats communication itself as a hate crime even when no violence follows. Experts also cite a 2015 Supreme Court ruling that laws criminalising speech must be precise, not vague or overly broad, to avoid a "chilling effect" in which people self-censor for fear of prosecution. BJP leaders and some activists have urged the governor not to pass the bill but to instead send it to the Indian president for consideration. Advocate and social activist Girish Bhardwaj, who has written to the governor, says the bill regulates citizens rather than hate speech. He argues it gives excessive discretion to "executive agencies" - senior police and administrative officers - to decide what speech falls under the law, raising the risk of conflicts of interest, especially when the government is being criticised. However, a senior Karnataka government official told the BBC, on condition of anonymity, that the bill would empower police by removing the need for government permission to file chargesheets, ruling out abuse of power. "The police will have to approach the court directly and face consequences for inaction or mistakes," the official said. This also means the accused can be tried regardless of political affiliation, the official added. "If a party worker indulges in hate speech or a hate crime, the ruling party may not sanction prosecution. Under this law, the government cannot intervene," the official said. Critics, however, argue that because the first point of action is the police, they may exercise a wider discretion in deciding what qualifies as hate speech. "The first step is the police; the judiciary comes much later," Kumar says, arguing that the law's breadth and harsh penalties could push police to act on political signals rather than independent judgement. "This is why I am not so sure this bill will achieve any of its intended effects at the end of the day," he adds.

### 3. [US discussing options to acquire Greenland, including use of military, says White House](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyg1jg8xkmo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

US discussing options to acquire Greenland, including use of military, says White House US President Donald Trump has been discussing "a range of options" to acquire Greenland, including use of the military, the White House said. The White House told the BBC that acquiring Greenland - a semi-autonomous region of fellow Nato member Denmark – was a "national security priority". The statement came hours after European leaders issued a joint statement rallying behind Denmark, which has been pushing back against Trump's ambitions for the Arctic island. Trump repeated over the weekend that the US "needed" Greenland for security reasons, prompting Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen to warn that any attack by the US would spell the end of Nato. The White House said on Tuesday: "The president and his team are discussing a range of options to pursue this important foreign policy goal, and of course, utilizing the US military is always an option at the Commander-in-Chief's disposal." Nato is a trans-Atlantic military group where allies are expected to go to each other's aid in case of external attacks. On Tuesday, six European allies expressed support for Denmark. "Greenland belongs to its people, and only Denmark and Greenland can decide on matters concerning their relations," the leaders of the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, and Denmark said in a joint statement. Stressing they were as keen as the US in Arctic security, the European signatories of the joint statement said this must be achieved by Nato allies, including the US "collectively". They also called for "upholding the principles of the UN Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders". Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen welcomed the statement and called for "respectful dialogue". "The dialogue must take place with respect for the fact that Greenland's status is rooted in international law and the principle of territorial integrity," Nielsen said. The issue of Greenland's future resurfaced in the wake of the US military intervention in Venezuela, during which elite troops seized the country's President Nicolás Maduro and took him to face drugs and weapons charges in New York. A day after that raid, Katie Miller - the wife of one of Trump's senior aides - posted a map on social media of Greenland in the colours of the American flag, alongside the word "SOON". On Monday, her husband, Stephen Miller, said it was "the formal position of the US government that Greenland should be part of the US". Asked repeatedly in an interview with CNN whether America would rule out using force to annex it, Miller responded: "Nobody's going to fight the US over the future of Greenland." Greenland, which has a population of 57,000 people, has had extensive self-government since 1979, though defence and foreign policy remain in Danish hands. While most Greenlanders favour eventual independence from Denmark, opinion polls show overwhelming opposition to becoming part of the US, which already has a military base on the island. Morgan Angaju, 27, an Inuit living in Ilulissat in the west region of the country, told the BBC it had been "terrifying to listen to the leader of the free world laughing at Denmark and Greenland and just talking about us like we're something to claim". "We are already claimed by the Greenlandic people. Kalaallit Nunaat means the land of the Greenlandic people," Morgan said. He added that he was worried about what happens next - wondering whether Greenland's prime minister may suffer the same fate as Maduro - or even about the US "invading our country". An unnamed US senior official told Reuters news agency that the American options included the outright purchase of Greenland or forming a Compact of Free Association with the territory. In response, a state department spokesperson told the BBC on Tuesday that the US "is eager to build lasting commercial relationships that benefit Americans and the people of Greenland". "Our common adversaries have been increasingly active in the Arctic. That is a concern that the United States, the Kingdom of Denmark, and NATO Allies share," the spokesperson said. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio also told lawmakers at a classified briefing on Capitol Hill on Monday that the Trump administration did not plan to invade Greenland, but mentioned buying it from Denmark, the Wall Street Journal reports. Greenland and Denmark previously said they had asked to meet Rubio quickly to discuss the American claims on the island. Denmark's Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said speaking with America's top diplomat should resolve "certain misunderstandings". Senator Eric Schmitt, a Republican from Missouri, emphasised the national security aspect when he spoke to the BBC on Tuesday. "I think they're just in talks right now," he said. "My hope is that Europe would understand that a strong America is good - it's good for Western civilisation." Trump floated his idea of acquiring Greenland as a strategic US hub in the Arctic during his first presidential term, saying in 2019: "Essentially it's a large real estate deal." There is growing interest from Russia and China in the island, which has untapped rare earth deposits, as melting ice raises the possibility of new trade routes. In March, Trump said America would "go as far as we have to go" to get control of the territory. During a congressional hearing last summer, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth was asked if the Pentagon had plans to take Greenland by force if necessary, and he said they "have plans for any contingency".

Opposition leader Machado says she should be in charge of Venezuela Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado has said she should "absolutely" be in charge of the country, following the US ousting of President Nicolás Maduro last week. "We are ready and willing to serve our people as we have been mandated," Machado said in an interview with the BBC's US partner CBS. She thanked US President Donald Trump for his "leadership and courage" after US forces stormed Caracas and arrested Maduro, but said nobody trusted the deposed president's ally who has been appointed as interim leader. Machado and her opposition movement claimed victory in 2024's heavily disputed elections, but Trump has refused to back her, saying she lacks popular support. The former legislator, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last year, described US military action in Venezuela over the weekend as "a major step towards restoring prosperity and rule of law and democracy in Venezuela". She said she had not spoken with Trump this year, but expressed gratitude to him for deposing Maduro. "President Trump's leadership and courage has brought Nicolás Maduro to face justice and this is huge," she told CBS. Despite her overtures, the US president has publicly dismissed Machado as a credible successor to Maduro. "I think it would be very tough for her to be the leader," Trump told a news conference days ago, referring to Machado. "She doesn't have the support within or the respect within the country. She's a very nice woman, but she doesn't have the respect." But Machado said nobody trusted Venezuela's interim leader, Delcy Rodríguez, who was formerly Maduro's vice-president. The opposition leader told CBS that Rodríguez was "one of the main architects... of repression for innocent people" in the South American country. "Everybody in Venezuela and abroad knows perfectly who she is and the role she has played," Machado said. While Rodríguez, 56, has faced US sanctions for her ministerial roles in the Maduro administration, she has not been charged by US officials with any crimes. Rodríguez was sworn in on Monday days after a US special forces breached Venezuelan security to arrest Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores. Earlier on Tuesday, Rodríguez rebuffed claims by Trump that the US was in charge of Venezuela. "The Venezuelan government rules our country, and no-one else does," she said in a televised speech. "There is no external agent governing Venezuela."

Lego unveils tech-filled Smart Bricks - to play experts' unease Lego has unveiled Smart Bricks - tech-filled versions of its small building blocks - which it says will bring sets to life with sound, light and reaction to movement. However, the new product range has got a mixed reaction from play experts, who say it risks undermining what makes Lego distinct for children in an increasingly digital world. Announced at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2026 in Las Vegas, the Danish toymaker's Smart Play system introduces new electronic components to the classic plastic blocks. Lego says its new tech-enabled products, launching in March with a new Star Wars set, are its "most revolutionary innovation" in nearly 50 years. But Josh Golin, executive director of children's wellbeing group Fairplay, believes Smart Bricks could "undermine what was once great about Legos" - harnessing children's own imagination during play. He said the toy did not require extra features to generate sounds or other effects. "As anyone who has ever watched a child play with old-school Legos knows, children's Lego creations already do move and make noises through the power of children's imaginations," he told the BBC. " Andrew Manches, professor of children and technology at the University of Edinburgh, agreed the beauty of Lego lay in "the freedom to create, re-create, and adapt simple blocks into endless stories powered by children's imagination". But he also welcomed Lego's efforts to integrate physical and digital play with tools that react to the way children interact with its Smart Play products. Julia Goldin, the company's chief product and marketing officer, previously told the BBC it viewed digital technology as an opportunity to "expand physical play and physical building". "We don't look at the digital world as a threat," she said - adding its smart range weaves interactivity "seamlessly" with its physical products. What are Lego Smart Bricks? Lego says its Smart Bricks can sense motion, position and distance, allowing the models to respond in various ways during play. Measuring 2x4, the brick itself contains sensors, lights, a small sound synthesiser, an accelerometer and a custom-made silicon chip enabling it to detect movement and react to it. But it is designed to be used with Smart Minifigures and Smart Tags tiles - two additional products making up Lego's Smart Play System. Similarly adapted from existing Lego components, these possess digital identifiers triggering different sounds or reactions when they detect and interact with each other. For instance, when tried out by the BBC at CES, a Lego birthday cake recognised when its "candles" were blown out - sounding a cheer and a happy birthday song. Meanwhile, a Lego helicopter made whooshing sounds when moved or rotated, with its Smart Brick lighting up red upon crashing. Tom Donaldson, head of Lego's Creative Play Lab, said the tech intended to respond to children's actions and complement the way they naturally play. He said the Smart Brick's reactions to responses would "hopefully inspire and surprise the user to keep them continuing to play". "We are building a platform that we want to last for many years," he said. Prof Manches told the BBC reduced cost and size of components has "enabled more toymakers to integrate digital technology seamlessly into a range of toys". But he added despite exciting innovation, concerns remain about the security and privacy of new and emerging smart toys for children - particularly those which integrate AI. "The key is to us all to remain critically reflective of the design of these toys, and to pay much attention to how they influence children's everyday lives," he said. It is not the first time Lego has dabbled in digital experimentation or sought to appeal to increasingly online audiences. Since 2017 it has released augmented reality apps and experiences letting people play with computer-generated models layered over their surroundings. Through collaborations with video game publishers such as Nintendo and Fortnite-maker Epic Games it has also looked to appeal to fans of trending games or new launches - releasing a Super Mario Minifigure in 2020 with a tiny display screen. Lego chief executive Niels B. Christiansen said in the firm’s 2024 annual report it had accelerated spending on digital technology as a "strategic area" for the company.

Iran anti-government protests spread to majority of provinces, videos show Protests have broken out in at least 17 of Iran's 31 provinces, presenting the largest challenge to the country's clerical establishment since 2022, a BBC Verify and BBC Persian analysis has found. The BBC's analysis of protests includes only those for which we have verified video footage - the true number is almost certainly far higher. There are reports of protests in a further 11 provinces. The wave of protests has spread rapidly across Iran since 28 December, when anger initially broke out in the capital Tehran following a fresh and sharp devaluation of the country's currency against the dollar and other major foreign currencies. Verified footage from the last 10 days shows evidence of anti-government demonstrations and gatherings in more than 50 towns and cities across the country, including in several regions previously perceived as being highly loyal to the state. More than 100 videos which we geolocated and checked for publication date paint a picture of the scale of the unrest, with people taking to the streets in many major cities in Iran and presenting the largest challenge to the state since the Women, Life and Freedom protests in 2022. Footage has also shown protests in Qom in central Iran and Mashhad in the north-east, both of which have traditionally hosted populations extremely loyal to the Islamic Republic. Prof Sina Azodi, Director of Middle East Studies Program at George Washington University, said that unrest in those cities was "very telling" and amounted to evidence that the government's "base of support is also suffering under the economic hardship". Authorities have traditionally used violence to crush unrest. During the 2022 protests - sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young woman who had been detained in Tehran for wearing "improper hijab" - more than 550 people were allegedly killed by security forces, according to human rights groups. While the latest response by police and security forces initially appeared to be more restrained, verified footage has shown officers ramping up the use of force since Saturday. This change in approach coincided with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's first public reaction to the protests on that day, in which he said that "rioters must be put in their place". Since the supreme leader's remarks, Iran's judiciary chief, Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei, said authorities would "listen to protesters and critics who legitimately and rightly have concerns about their livelihood and social and economic welfare". But he added that they would "deal firmly with those who seek to exploit the situation, incite riots, and undermine the security of the country and the people". The powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) has also issued warnings to protesters in Lorestan province that they will no longer tolerate street gatherings. BBC Persian has so far confirmed the identities of at least 11 people reported dead since 28 December using a combination of verified funeral videos and interviews with family members and friends. Foreign-based human rights group HRANA says at least 35 people have so far been killed in the unrest, including two affiliated with security forces. One of the most violent crackdowns happened in Malekshahi, a small town in the western province of Ilam, on Saturday. Verified footage showed a small demonstration taking place at Commandery Boulevard, where the officers of several state institutions are located, before gunfire appeared to break out. Human rights groups said four people were killed in the incident, with the semi-official Mehr and Tasnim news agencies putting the figure at three dead. Later footage showed a number of people being transported to hospital. It was unclear from the footage what condition those seen in the footage were in. Multiple verified videos filmed in the nearby Ilam city show security forces firing shots towards Imam Khomeini Hospital in the centre of the city later on Saturday. Iran's president has ordered an investigation into the incident. Security forces have also been firing on protestors in other cities. In Fasa in the south-western Fars province, forces wearing military and riot gear were seen firing towards demonstrators. Experts warned that the security forces heavy-handed response could exacerbate the challenges facing the government. "Escalating repression is likely to deepen popular resentment toward the political system while risking fatigue and demoralisation within the police and security forces - who, at some point, may cease to comply with orders," Peyman Jafari, assistant professor of international relations at the US-based College of William and Mary, told BBC Verify. Iran security force member killed during protests, officials say - Iran protests enter ninth day as Trump renews intervention threat - Protests and US warnings shake Iran at its weakest point in years - While most of the footage featuring violence seen by the BBC was carried out by security forces, a few clips have also shown demonstrators attacking government forces. In Qom, one video showed officers riding motorbikes being pelted with rocks as they sped past a small gathering. Another dramatic clip showed a security officer on a motorbike set ablaze by a demonstrator wielding an improvised flamethrower after security forces violently detained and beat up a protester. It is unclear what happened to the officer, as the footage cut off, while other officers gave chase to the demonstrator who fled on foot. And in the western city of Azna, demonstrators appeared to start a fire outside a police station after security forces opened fire on protesters earlier. BBC Persian has identified at least three demonstrators killed in Azna by verifying footage of funerals and speaking to family members. The demonstrations initially began as a backlash against what they say is the government's mismanagement of the country's struggling economy, which has increasingly floundered under the weight of international sanctions. Officials have also been accused of widespread corruption. But in recent days the demonstrations have taken an anti-state tone, with protesters in numerous locations chanting slogans against Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the clerical establishment that has been ruling the country since the 1979 Islamic revolution. Verified videos have also shown chants in support of Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the Shah of Iran, and the pre-1979 revolution Pahlavi dynasty. At the University of Tehran, some protesters chanted "death to the dictator" - a reference to Khamenei - as dozens of demonstrators flooded through the institution's main gate on 30 December. And in the city of Iranshahr in the coastal Sistan and Baluchestan province, protesters set fire to a statue of Khamenei and the leader of the 1979 revolution, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Holly Dagres, senior fellow at the Washington Institute and curator of the Iranist newsletter, said the Tehran government had learned few lessons from the 2022 protests which raged across Iran for more than four months. "While the catalysts differ… the problems remain the same: systemic mismanagement, corruption, and repression," she said. "The countless anti-regime chants make clear that many Iranians are calling for the ouster of the Islamic Republic." Despite the extent of the demonstrations, most of the experts who spoke to the BBC said they do not yet amount to an existential threat to the state. "Security forces are loyal - there are no defections at this point and law enforcement forces are carrying out the orders," Azodi said. "Furthermore, while the protests are widespread we are not seeing a clear strategy [or] attempt by the protesters to bring down the Islamic Republic."

Children killed after drone hits home in Sudan, medics say At least 13 people have been killed - eight of them children - after a drone strike on a house in the Sudanese city of el-Obeid, says the Sudan Doctors' Network. Most of the dead were part of the same family, the medical group added. Although no group has claimed responsibility, the medics say the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) carried out the attack in an area controlled by the army, and which it has been trying to penetrate for months. As the civil war between Sudan's army and RSF rebels approaches its third year, the scale of suffering has seen it described as the world's worst humanitarian crisis by the UN and aid agencies. To date, more than 11 million people have been forced from their homes by the violence, and hundreds of thousands of people have been killed. Widespread sexual violence is also being used as a weapon of war. Both the RSF and the Sudanese Armed Forces are accused of atrocities. Witnesses say Monday's drone attack on the house in el-Obeid happened in a residential neighbourhood. The Sudan Doctors' Network says it "reflects a dangerous escalation of the policy of indiscriminate killing and systematic bombing of safe residential areas". The city of el-Obeid remains under army control despite the RSF's advance elsewhere in the wider state of North Kordofan. Analysts say it is a key target for the RSF because of its strategic location between Sudan's capital city, Khartoum, and the Darfur region where they have established a parallel government and are accused of genocide. The attack comes days after the RSF hit a power plant in el-Obeid, and also follows what the army claims was an attempted RSF drone attack on the country's largest hydro-electric dam near the northern town of Merowe.

Trump's Venezuela raid has created chaos - and that is a risk for China It took just a few hours for Donald Trump to upend a relationship that China had been cultivating for decades. Only hours before he was seized in a nighttime raid, Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro had been praising his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping as "an older brother" with a "powerful message as a leader to the world" during a meeting with senior diplomats from Beijing. China has invested heavily in oil-rich Venezuela, one of its closest South American partners. And its state media showed off the footage from that meeting to prove it: smiling men in suits, reviewing some of the 600 current agreements between their two countries - except the next photograph of Maduro was taken on board a US warship, blindfolded and handcuffed, in grey sweats. China joined many countries around the world in condemning Washington's stunning move against a sovereign state. It accused the US of acting like a "world judge" and insisted that "the sovereignty and security of all countries should be fully protected under international law". Those stern words aside, Beijing will be making careful calculations not just to insure its foothold in South America, but also to manage an already tricky relationship with Trump and plot its next steps as the great power competition between the US and China takes a new, wholly unexpected turn. Many see this as an opportunity for China's authoritarian Communist Party rulers. But there is also risk, uncertainty and frustration as Beijing tries to figure out what to do after Trump tore up the very international rulebook it has spent decades trying to play by. Beijing, which likes to play the long game, is no fan of chaos. That is certainly what it seems to be coming up repeatedly against in Trump's second term. It had planned ahead and weathered the on-again, off-again trade war. Xi will believe he showed the US and the world just how dependent they are on Chinese manufacturing and technology. But now Beijing faces a new challenge. Trump's play for Venezuelan oil has likely strengthened China's deepest doubts about American intentions – how far would the US go to contain Chinese influence? Speaking to NBC on Sunday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio declared: "This is the western hemisphere. This is where we live – and we're not going to allow the western hemisphere to be a base of operations for adversaries, competitors and rivals of the United States." The not-so-hidden message was for Beijing: get out of our backyard. Beijing is unlikely to listen. But it will wait to see what happens next. Some wonder if China is waiting and watching to see if it could do the same in Taiwan, the self-governing island which it views as a breakaway province. Xi has vowed that Taiwan will one day be "reunified" with the mainland and has not ruled out the use of force to achieve this. And some nationalists on Chinese social media are asking: if the US can unilaterally act in Caracas, what is stopping Beijing from snatching the Taiwanese president? For one, Beijing might not see those parallels because it considers Taiwan an internal matter, and not a concern of the international order. But more important, if Xi decides to invade the island, it will not be because the US has set a precedent, according to David Sacks from the Council on Foreign Relations. He writes that China doesn't have the "confidence that it can succeed at an acceptable cost". "Until that day comes, though, China will continue with its strategy of employing coercion to wear down Taiwan's people, with the aim of forcing Taiwan to the negotiating table. The US strikes on Venezuela do not change this dynamic." Rather, they are a challenge China did not need and does not want - and they risk its long-term plan to win over the Global South. The relationship between Beijing and Caracas was fairly simple. China needed oil. Venezuela needed cash. From around 2000 to 2023 Beijing provided more than $100bn to Venezuela to finance railways, power plants and other infrastructure projects. In exchange, Caracas gave Beijing the oil it needed to fuel its booming economy. Around 80% of Venezuelan oil was sent to China last year. That's still only 4% of the country's oil imports. So, when it comes to China's financial risks in Caracas, "it's important to keep some perspective", says Eric Olander, editor-in-chief of The China-Global South Project. "Chinese firms like CNPC and Sinopec are among the largest players there and there is a risk of those assets either being nationalised by the Venezuelans, under the direction of the US or otherwise marginalised amid the chaos." There are also around $10bn of outstanding loans that Venezuela owes Chinese creditors, but again, Olander urges caution as it's unclear if any investments in the country are currently at risk. But it could warn off future investors. "Chinese enterprises need to fully assess the risks and extent of potential US intervention before investing in related projects," Cui Shoujun, from the School of International Relations at Renmin University, said on Chinese state media. Beijing will not want to jeopardise the fragile trade truce it just signed with the US, but it won't want to lose its foothold in Latin America either. Striking that balance is going to be hard, especially with someone as unpredictable as Trump. The concern for China is that other countries across South America start to worry about significant Chinese investments "out of concern of attracting unwanted US attention", Olander says. "This region is a critical source of food, energy and natural resources to China with two-way trade now topping half a trillion dollars." The US has also made it clear it wants the Panamanian government to cancel all Chinese port holdings and investments related to the Panama Canal, which, he adds, is "undeniably concerning for China". So Beijing may have to win the battle in Washington's backyard in other ways. China has shown patience and persistence in wooing South America. The Global South is a group of countries that have signed up to "a community with a shared future" and urge opposition to "unilateral bullying". This message resonates with governments that have grown wary of the West and, in particular, Washington under Trump. China is usually explicit from the start about what it wants from its partners - they recognise the "One China" principle and Taiwan is treated as an "integral part" of China. Beijing has had considerable success in persuading Latin American states to switch diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China, with Costa Rica, Panama, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Honduras all siding with the $19tn economy's talk of strategic partnership over the last 20 years. In contrast, Trump has shown that a relationship with Washington can be volatile. And that could play into China's hands, as it seeks to project Xi as a stable leader, now more than ever before. "This is important because the situation in Venezuela could easily descend into chaos," Olander says. "Also, don't forget the lesson from Iraq, where the US also said the country's oil reserves would pay for the reconstruction of the economy. That did not happen and China is now the largest buyer of Iraqi crude. Something similar could easily happen in Venezuela." For years, the US was urged by China hawks in Congress to counter Beijing's influence across South America. It has made its move but what no-one seems sure of is what comes next. Everything about this is a gamble – and Beijing, by all accounts, hates to gamble.
