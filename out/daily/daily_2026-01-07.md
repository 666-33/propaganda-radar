Aldrich Ames, CIA agent who sold secrets to the Soviets, dies aged 84 Aldrich Ames, a CIA officer who became one of America's most damaging double agents, has died aged 84. The former counterintelligence officer, who was serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole, died on Monday at the Federal Correctional Institution in Cumberland, Maryland, CBS News, the BBC's media partner in the US, reported. Ames was jailed on 28 April 1994 after he admitted to selling secret information to the Soviet Union and later Russia. He compromised more than 100 clandestine operations and divulged the identities of more than 30 agents spying for the West - leading to the deaths of at least 10 CIA intelligence assets. Seeking money to pay debts, Ames said he began providing the KGB with the names of CIA spies in April 1985, receiving an initial payment of $50,000. Known to the KGB by his code name, Kolokol (The Bell), Ames went on to identify virtually all of the CIA's spies in the Soviet Union, for which he was well rewarded. "To my enduring surprise, the KGB replied that it had set aside for me $2 million in gratitude for the information," he said in an eight-page statement he read to the court. Over the course of nine years, Ames admitted receiving a total of about $2.5 million from the Soviet Union for his betrayal of the US. The cash fuelled a lavish lifestyle, with Ames splashing out on a new Jaguar car, foreign holidays and a $540,000 house - despite never having a salary of more than $70,000 a year. Ames's 31-year career at the CIA began when his father, an analyst at the CIA, helped him land a job there after dropping out of college in 1962. He married his first wife, fellow CIA agent Nancy Segebarth, in 1969, before being sent to Turkey as a counterintelligence officer to recruit foreign agents. Three years later, he was brought back to the US, where his problems with alcohol began to emerge and his marriage began to collapse. Despite several security violations over the years, including leaving a briefcase full of classified information on a subway, Ames was then sent to Mexico City in 1981. There he met his second wife, Maria del Rosario Casas Dupuy, a cultural attaché at the Colombian embassy and a CIA asset who would later be charged as his accomplice. Returning to the US in 1983, Ames became head of the CIA's Soviet counterintelligence department - despite continuing concerns over his drinking. While his career was soaring, his personal life was spiralling. As well as paying monthly support to his first wife, he was also funding Rosario's lifestyle, including her love of shopping. It was his escalating debts that led him to selling the wealth of secrets that he had access to. "It was about the money, and I don't think he ever really tried to lead anybody to believe it was anything more than that," FBI agent Leslie G Wiser, who was involved in the investigation that led to Ames's arrest, told the BBC's Witness History in 2015. His treachery began in 1985 when he gave the Soviets the names of a few KGB officers secretly working for the FBI in exchange for $50,000. His espionage continued for the following nine years, until his arrest on 21 February 1994, after a mole hunt that had started closing in the year before. Ames cooperated with the authorities in exchange for a plea deal that secured a lenient sentence for Rosario, who admitted she had known about the money and his meetings with the Soviets. She was released after five years. The CIA director at the time, R. James Woolsey, described Ames as "a malignant betrayer of his country". Woolsey said the agents Ames betrayed died because a "murdering traitor wanted a bigger house and a Jaguar".

Families shocked Swiss ski bar was not inspected for years before deadly fire Families of the victims of a fire at a Swiss bar on New Year's Eve have expressed shock after officials admitted the venue had not undergone safety checks for five years. Romain Jordan, who represents some of the families, said the "staggering number of breaches and shortcomings in the inspections raises the question of whether the municipality should be investigated with even greater urgency". Other lawyers also urged officials to take responsibility for the disaster at Le Constellation bar in Crans-Montana in which 40 people died and 116 were injured. Prosecutors believe the fire started when champagne bottles with sparklers attached set light to sound-insulating foam on the ceiling. The two bar managers have been placed under criminal investigation, but not in custody. French couple Jacques and Jessica Moretti are suspected of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence. In their first statement since the fire, they said they were "devastated" and pledged "full co-operation" with the investigation. Venues like Le Constellation should have been checked annually, but the mayor of Crans-Montana, Nicolas Feraud, said on Tuesday he could not explain why it hadn't been checked in so long. "We regret that - we owe it to the families and we will accept the responsibility," he said. He added that sparklers would be banned in local venues. Most of the victims of the fire were young - eight under the age of 16. Many of the injured have severe burns and are being treated in Switzerland and other European countries. The funerals of some of those who died have been taking place. Under Switzerland's political system, power is distributed among three levels of the confederation, 26 cantons and then about 2,131 municipalities. While safety regulations are set by cantons, they need to be implemented by local authorities.

Yemen separatist leader accused of treason as Saudi Arabia strikes forces The Saudi-backed presidential council in Yemen has expelled the leader of a separatist group and charged him with treason after he failed to fly to Riyadh for talks. Six other members of the presidency accused Aidarous al-Zubaidi, head of the United Arab Emirates-backed Southern Transitional Council (STC), of "undermining the independence of the republic". A Saudi-led military coalition said Zubaidi "fled" after not joining STC officials on a flight from Aden and "moved a large force" to al-Dahle province. Coalition aircraft launched strikes on the forces in response, it added. The STC said the strikes, which reportedly killed four people, were "unjustified" and that Zubaidi was still in Aden. It also expressed concern that contact had been lost with the group's delegation in Riyadh. The past few weeks have seen southern Yemen moving to the brink of a new conflict, pitting factions battling the Iran-backed Houthi movement in the country's decade-long civil war against each other and deepening a rift between Saudi Arabia and the UAE. STC-aligned forces have in recent years taken control of much of the south, which they want once again to be an independent state, by pushing out forces loyal to the internationally recognised government and the Presidential Leadership Council overseeing it. In December, the STC's forces launched offensives to seize the eastern provinces of Hadramawt and al-Mahra from the government, saying they were necessary to "restore stability" in the south and combat the Houthis, al-Qaeda and Islamic State group. However, Saudi Arabia warned last week that the advances near the kingdom's borders constituted threats to its national security as well as the security and stability of Yemen. It also accused the UAE of "pressuring" its separatist allies to push into eastern Yemen and expressed support for a demand from the presidential council for all Emirati forces to leave. At the same time, the Saudi-led coalition - which was formed in 2015 by Arab states, including the UAE, after the Houthis seized control of north-western Yemen - struck what it said was a shipment of weapons and military vehicles for the STC that had arrived from the UAE. The UAE expressed "deep regret" at the Saudi accusations and denied there were any weapons, but agreed to pull its remaining forces out of the country. Since then, forces loyal to the government have largely retaken control of Hadramawt and al-Mahra with the help of coalition air strikes. In order to further diffuse tensions, Zubaidi and an STC delegation had been due to fly from Aden to Riyadh on Tuesday night for talks with the government. However, the coalition said the plane left three hours late without Zubaidi, who "fled to an unknown location". "The legitimate government and the coalition received intelligence indicating that Zubaidi had moved a large force - including armoured vehicles, combat vehicles, heavy and light weapons, and ammunition - from the Jabal Hadid and al-Solban camps [in Aden] towards al-Dhale," coalition spokesman Maj-Gen Turki al-Malki said in a statement. "Coalition forces, in co-ordination with legitimate government forces and the [Saudi-backed] National Shield Forces, launched limited pre-emptive strikes to disrupt these forces and thwart Zubaidi's attempts to escalate the conflict and extend it into al-Dhale," he added. More than 15 strikes hit al-Dahle early on Wednesday and at least four civilians were killed, two hospital sources told AFP news agency. Maliki also accused Zubaidi of distributing weapons to "dozens of elements" in Aden "with the aim of creating unrest", and said the coalition had asked STC deputy leader Abdul Rahman al-Mahrami, who is also a member of the presidential council, to impose security there. Later, the presidential council issued a decree saying Zubaidi had been stripped of his membership and referred to the attorney general for prosecution on charges including "high treason", "damaging the republic's military, political and economic standing", and "forming an armed gang and committing the murder of officers and soldiers of the armed forces". "It has been established that [Zubaidi] has abused the just cause of the South and exploited it to commit grave crimes against civilians in the southern governorates," it alleged. The STC's foreign affairs authority said in a statement that it had sent a delegation led by its secretary-general, Sheikh Abdul Rahman al-Subaihi, to Riyadh because it was committed to "engaging positively and responsibly with various political initiatives and dialogue efforts". "At the same time, President Aidarous Qassem al-Zubaidi continues to carry out his duties from the capital, Aden, alongside his people, closely following up on and directly supervising the work of the military, security, and civilian institutions," it added. The STC said it had been "taken by surprise" by the coalition air strikes in al-Dahle, describing them as an "unfortunate escalation that is inconsistent with the declared climate of dialogue". It also expressed concern that no official information had been received about the whereabouts and circumstances of Subaihi's delegation in Riyadh, which it said "raises serious questions that require urgent clarification".

### 4. [Plot to kill Burkina Faso leader foiled, says junta](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyz4dzyq7po?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

Plot to kill Burkina Faso leader foiled, says junta A plot to kill Burkina Faso's military leader, Capt Ibrahim Traoré, has been thwarted, the West African nation has announced. The sophisticated plan had been hatched by Lt Col Paul Henri Damiba, the military officer ousted by Traoré in September 2022, the security minister said in a late-night broadcast. "Our intelligence services intercepted this operation in the final hours. They had planned to assassinate the head of state and then strike other key institutions, including civilian personalities," said Mahamadou Sana, further alleging that the plot had been funded from neighbouring Ivory Coast. There has been no comment from either Col Damiba or Ivory Coast. Since seizing power, Capt Traoré has faced at least two coup attempts and is also grappling with growing jihadist violence that has forced millions from their homes. Despite these challenges and his authoritarian reputation, the 37-year-old military leader maintains strong popular support and has gained a following across the continent for his pan-Africanist vision and criticism of Western influence. According to the security minister, the authorities uncovered a leaked video showing the plotters discussing their plans. In the footage they allegedly spoke about how they intended to assassinate the president - either at close range or by planting explosives at his residence - just after 23:00 local time on Saturday 3 January. Afterwards they allegedly planned to target other senior military and civilian figures. Sana alleged that Damiba had mobilised both soldiers and civilian supporters, secured foreign funding - most significantly 70m CFA francs ($125,000; £92,000) delivered from Ivory Coast - and planned to knock out the country's drone-launch base before foreign forces could intervene. "We are carrying out ongoing investigations and have made several arrests. These individuals will be brought to justice soon," the minister said on national television. Sana insisted the situation was under control and urged citizens "not to be misled, out of naivety, into dangerous schemes". It is not clear how many people have been arrested. Critics, both local and foreign, have accused Traoré of authoritarianism and say his government suppresses dissent - including arbitrary arrests of military officers and restrictions on the media. It is not the first time the junta has pointed the finger of blame about foreign interference in its affairs at Ivory Coast. These continuing internal power struggles will further heighten regional tensions. Col Damiba served as Burkina Faso's leader from January-September 2022 after seizing power from an elected government. After being ousted he went into exile in neighbouring Togo and said in a message published on social media that he wished his successor every success.

**Excerpt**

Nigeria's ex-justice minister granted bail in $6m corruption case A Nigerian court has granted bail to the country's former attorney general, Abubakar Malami, along with his wife and son, who are facing money laundering charges. Malami, 58, was one of the most influential figures in the administration of former President Muhammadu Buhari between 2015 and 2023. He was charged last month with 16 counts of money laundering and abuse of office worth a total of 8.7bn naira ($6m; £4.5m), and has been held in prison since 30 December. In court, he pleaded not guilty to all charges. He previously described his arrest as politically motivated. The lawyer, who is married to Buhari‘s third child, Nana Hadiza, recently left the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to join the opposition African Democratic Congress, which is viewed as the biggest rival to the APC in the 2027 general elections. Malami is one of several ministers in the Buhari administration accused of corruption, including another influential figure, Hadi Sirika, who was in charge of the country’s aviation ministry. In court on Wednesday, presiding judge Emeka Nwite stated that the charges against the defendants were bailable offences. He said they could be released on bail set at 500 million naira (£260,000; $350,000) each. They must also provide two guarantors who own property in designated parts of the capital, Abuja, and surrender their travel documents to the court. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) alleges that the former minister used his office to divert government funds, which were then used to acquire properties in several Nigerian cities, including Abuja. The EFCC recently released a list of high-value properties allegedly linked to Malami, including hotels, residential buildings, schools, factories, parcels of land and a printing press. The properties are spread across the capital, Abuja, as well as Kebbi and Kano states. The scale of the properties he allegedly owned sparked a national debate about the wealth of Nigeria's politicians when the list was released. Political analyst Idris Adamu told the BBC the case had taken him by surprise given the minister's previous perceived invulnerability. "Seeing the video of Malami being ushered into the vehicle that would take him to Kuje prison last month felt surreal," Adamu said. "This was a man that wielded so much power and influence under Buhari." He added that the high-profile prosecution signalled that "no-one is above the law, even if you are the former justice minister of a country". The case has been adjourned until 17 February 2025.

Six dead and hundreds of flights cancelled as snow causes chaos across Europe Intense snowfall and icy weather conditions have caused widespread travel disruption across Europe, with six reported killed in weather-related incidents on the continent. Five people died in two separate regions of France as a result of treacherous driving conditions, authorities said, while one woman was also killed in Bosnia's capital, Sarajevo, after 16in (40cm) of snow fell on the city. Hundreds of flights have been cancelled across Europe, with thousands left stranded at airports in Paris and Amsterdam. Disruption is expected to continue into Wednesday. In France, three people died in two separate incidents in Landes, in the south-west, due to black ice, authorities said. Two more died in separate motor accidents in the Paris region. One was the result of a collision between a driver and a heavy goods vehicle in east Paris, police said. The other was killed after a taxi driver hit a kerb due to snow and plunged into the Marne river, the outlet said. The Balkans has also seen snow and heavy rain. A woman died in the Bosnian capital Sarajevo on Monday after a tree weighed down with wet snow fell on her, police said. French Transport Minister Philippe Tabarot said more snow was expected in the country on Tuesday night and Wednesday. He called on people to travel as little as possible on the roads and to work from home. France's national weather service said 38 districts would be placed on orange alert for snow and black ice on Wednesday. Many train services were cancelled in parts of the country. In France's capital, authorities said Roissy-Charles de Gaulle airport would see 40% of its flights cancelled for several hours on Wednesday morning, so that staff could clear snow from the runways. The capital's Orly airport planned to cancel a quarter of its flights during the same time period. More than 400 flights were cancelled at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport on Wednesday, causing widespread disruption to travel plans. Hundreds of passengers were stranded, with many unable to join connecting flights. Long queues formed at airline counters as people waited for information about when flights would resume. Many of the cancelled flights were operated by Dutch airline KLM, which warned it had nearly run out of de-icing fluid for its aircraft. It blamed the "extreme" weather conditions and supply delays. At Schiphol airport, many travellers complained of long lines and a lack of information. Spanish passenger Javier Sepulveda, who was trying to fly from Amsterdam to Norway, told Reuters news agency the situation at the airport was "chaotic, unacceptable, frustrating, annoying" and "totally unacceptable." He said he started queuing at the KLM help desk at 06:30 local time (07:30 GMT) on Tuesday and that six hours later he was still far from the front of the line. Schipol airport said its "snow crews are working around the clock to keep the runways clear, and aircraft are being carefully de-iced to ensure everyone can travel safely." A further 600 flights scheduled to take off from Schiphol on Wednesday have also been cancelled, Dutch broadcaster NOS reported. Rail journeys were also disrupted. On Tuesday morning, all train services in the Netherlands stopped for a short period after an IT outage. Some trains started running after 09:00 local time (10:00 GMT) but problems persisted during the day. Eurostar services to Paris from Amsterdam were either cancelled or running late.

### 7. [Japan nuclear agency worker loses phone with confidential data in China](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8j38rmm4z3o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

Japan nuclear agency worker loses phone with confidential data in China An employee at Japan's nuclear safety agency lost his work phone containing sensitive information during a personal trip to China, Japanese media report. The phone contained confidential contact details of staff involved in nuclear security work at the Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA). The agency could not confirm if the data was leaked, reports say. The incident comes as Japan attempts to revive its atomic energy programme, which has been stalled for more than a decade. Japan ordered all its nuclear power plant reactors to be shut down in 2011 after a magnitude 9 earthquake and massive tsunami caused a meltdown at the Fukushima nuclear plant. The NRA was formed after the Fukushima nuclear disaster to oversee nuclear safety, including the restarting of the country's reactors. The NRA employee is believed to have lost his work phone on 3 November while undergoing a security check at a Shanghai airport on a personal trip. He noticed the phone was missing three days later and, despite checking with the airport, did not recover it. The NRA issues smartphones to certain employees so they can respond promptly to emergencies, the Asahi newspaper reported. According to Kyodo News, the affected NRA department deals with protecting nuclear materials from threats like theft and terrorism at the country's facilities. The NRA reported the incident to the country's Personal Information Protection Commission and has warned employees against bringing work phones overseas, local media reported. This is not the first time that Japan's nuclear officials have made headlines for security lapses. In 2023, an employee at the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant—the world's largest nuclear facility—lost a stack of documents after placing it on top of their car and driving off. Last November, another employee at the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant was found to have mishandled confidential documents by making copies of them and locking them in a desk. And this week, Chubu Electric Power, a nuclear plant operator in central Japan, said it might have used cherry-picked data during safety screenings for its nuclear plant. The NRA has since suspended its review for Chubu to restart its reactors, citing the "fabrication of critical inspection data", Reuters reported.

**Excerpt**

UK and France to send troops to Ukraine if peace deal agreed The UK and France have signed a declaration of intent on deploying troops in Ukraine if a peace deal is made with Russia, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has announced. After talks with Ukraine's allies in Paris, he said the UK and France would "establish military hubs across Ukraine" to deter future invasion, while French President Emmanuel Macron later said thousands of troops may be deployed. Allies also largely agreed robust security guarantees for Ukraine and proposed that the US would take the lead in monitoring a truce. But the key issue of territory is still being discussed. Russia has repeatedly warned that any foreign troops in Ukraine would be a "legitimate target". Moscow has not yet commented on the announcements made in the French capital. Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory. Heads of state and top officials from the "Coalition of the Willing" took part in Tuesday's talks in Paris. Speaking at a joint press conference after the meeting, Starmer said: "We signed a declaration of intent on the deployment of forces to Ukraine in the event of a peace deal. "This is a vital part of our commitment to stand with Ukraine for the long-term. "It paves the way for the legal framework under which British, French, and partner forces could operate on Ukrainian soil, securing Ukraine's skies and seas, and regenerating Ukraine's armed forces for the future." The UK prime minister added London would participate in any US-led verification of a potential ceasefire. Top US negotiator Steve Witkoff said "durable security guarantees and robust prosperity commitments are essential to a lasting peace" in Ukraine - referring to a key demand made by Kyiv. Witkoff said the allies "largely finished" their work on agreeing security protocols "so that people of Ukraine know that when this [war] ends, it ends forever". Jared Kushner, US President Donald Trump's special envoy and son-in-law, said that after a deal Ukrainians needed to know that "real backstops" were in place to ensure war would "not happen again". Meanwhile, President Macron said Ukraine's allies had made "considerable progress" at the talks. He said "robust" security guarantees for Kyiv had been agreed in the event of a potential ceasefire. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said a "huge step forward" had been made in Paris, but added that he would only consider efforts to be "enough" if they resulted in the end of the war. What Ukraine calls security "guarantees" and what American officials have described as security "protocols" may leave some wiggle room for Trump in the event of coming to Kyiv's defence after a future Russian attack - but there is no doubt Zelensky feels he and his European allies have secured an important concession from Washington. We heard few, if any, new details about where a future ceasefire line would be drawn and what territory, currently occupied by Russian forces, Ukraine would agree to surrender. That prospect is still something many Ukrainians would find hard to swallow, especially as Russia continues to strike against cities and critical infrastructure across Ukraine on a daily basis. But as the snows fall and bitter winds sweep in from the east, Zelensky knows the only alternative to a ceasefire and subsequent peace deal, is another costly, attritional winter of warfare with the inevitable loss of life that will hit Ukraine far harder than Russia. Ukraine's president clearly hopes that guarantees of American monitoring, a multinational force on Ukrainian soil and more weapons support for his armed forces, will convince a sometimes-sceptical population that he is right to sue for peace, bolstered by a growing international coalition. But, in concluding the Paris press conference, Zelensky acknowledged Tuesday's "milestone" did not necessarily guarantee peace. Real progress still needs Russian support, and Moscow has been notably silent in recent days about diplomatic efforts to end the war. Putin is known to oppose the prospect of a European-led international force in any disputed areas and will be reluctant to halt his troops', albeit slow, advance if Moscow's war objectives have not been realised. But pressure is undoubtedly growing on both sides to make compromises and end the war. Last week, Zelensky said a peace deal was "90% ready". Agreeing on the remaining 10% would "determine the fate of peace, the fate of Ukraine and Europe". Territory and security guarantees have been at the forefront of unresolved issues for negotiators. Putin has repeatedly warned that Ukrainian troops must withdraw from all of Ukraine's eastern Donbas or Russia will seize it, rejecting any compromise over how to end the war. Zelensky has so far ruled out ceding any territory, but has suggested that Ukraine could withdraw its troops to an agreed point - but only if Russia does the same. Moscow currently controls about 75% of the Donetsk region, and some 99% of the neighbouring Luhansk. The two regions form the industrial region of Donbas. The original US-led 28-point peace plan widely leaked to the media last year was seen by Kyiv and its European allies as being heavily skewed in Russia's favour. This triggered weeks of intensive high-level diplomacy - with Ukraine, the US and European leaders trying to amend the draft. Last month, Kyiv sent the US an updated 20-point plan - as well as separate documents outlining potential security guarantees and provisions for Ukraine's reconstruction, Zelensky said.
