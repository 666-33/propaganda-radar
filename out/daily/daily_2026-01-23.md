Could Trump's bid to become peacemaker-in-chief sideline the struggling UN? "Together we are in a position to… end decades of suffering, stop generations of hatred and bloodshed, and forge a beautiful, everlasting and glorious peace for that region and for the whole region of the world." Such was the soaring promise of US President Donald Trump as he inaugurated his new Board of Peace on the stage of stages that is the Davos Economic Forum this week. The world of all too much suffering and strife badly wants to believe him. But for many observers and officials in capitals the world over, it is yet more proof of Trump's drive to dismantle the post-war international architecture and replace it with new institutions - dominated by him. "We will not let anyone play us," Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk warned tersely on social media. But from Trump's biggest backer in Europe, Viktor Orban, came effusive praise: "If Trump, then peace." What exactly will this Board, headed in perpetuity by Trump himself, do? Could this really be a bid to build a UN mini-me? Power of the Board chairman The idea - born last year in US-led efforts to end the war in Gaza and endorsed by a UN Security Council resolution - now has a much greater, far grander, more global ambition. And it pivots around the president. In leaked details of the draft charter he is the Board's chairman for life even when he leaves office. Under that charter his powers would be vast: authority to invite member states or not; to create or dissolve subsidiary bodies; and the mandate to appoint his successor whenever he decides to step down, or if he is incapacitated. If any other country would like to become a permanent member, the price is an eye-watering $1 billion (£740m). This latest bombshell lands in what is already a head-spinning month. In a few short weeks there's already been the US capture of Venezuela's leader, Trump threats and preparations for military action against Iran, and demands to acquire Greenland which sent shock waves across Europe and beyond. Nineteen countries showed up in Davos for the Board's inauguration from all corners of the compass - from Argentina to Azerbaijan, from former Soviet republics to Gulf kingdoms. Many more are said to have "agreed to join". "In this group, I like every single one of them," Trump grinned as he eyed leaders and officials whose names are now on this Board or the layers of executive bodies beneath it. Many more potential members have so far politely demurred. "This is about a treaty that raises much broader issues, and we do also have concerns about President Putin being part of something that is talking about peace" explained the UK's Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper. Trump says Russia is on board although the message from Moscow was that they were still "consulting partners". "As the text stands right now," we're not joining, replied Sweden. "The proposal raises unanswered questions that require further dialogue with Washington" was Norway's diplomatic response. Even a group of seven predominantly Muslim countries, including six Arab nations, as well as Turkey and Indonesia, made it clear they were in it for a "just and lasting peace in Gaza," including the reconstruction of the shattered enclave. However leaked details of the Board's charter don't mention Gaza. For some of the critics, including some countries reluctant to join, it's a vainglorious project for a president who doesn't hide his fixation with winning the biggest accolade – the Nobel Peace Prize, which was was won by President Obama in 2009 at the start of his first term in the White House. World leaders know there may be a price to pay for not joining this new club. "I'll put a 200% tariff on his wines and champagnes, and he'll join, but he doesn't have to join." This was the president's rebuke to France's President Emmanuel Macron with a threat to wield his weapon of choice. Only Slovenia said the quiet part out loud. Prime Minister Robert Golob made his concern clear – it "dangerously interferes with the broader international order". Trump addressed this concern head-on. "Once this Board is completely formed, we can do pretty much whatever we want to do and we'll do it in conjunction with the United Nations," he explained to the packed hall hanging on his every word. But he likes to keep the world guessing. A day earlier, when asked by a Fox TV journalist whether his Board would replace the UN, he replied "Well it might. The UN just hasn't been very helpful." Then he added "I'm a big fan of the UN potential, but it has never lived up to its potential. The UN should have settled every one of the wars that I settled." A new contender for peacemaker-in-chief? The UN, 193 members strong, has indeed long lost its role as peacemaker-in-chief. When I interviewed the Secretary General António Guterres in October 2016, on his first day in his first term, just hours after a rare unanimous endorsement by the Security Council, he promised "a surge in diplomacy for peace". For the past decade, the UN's efforts were thwarted by the gridlocked Security Council, the growing number of spoilers and state sponsors in wars the world over, as well as the steady erosion in its own standing vis-a-vis the world's most powerful players, including the United States. "We must all welcome the activism of Mr Trump on ending wars," says Martin Griffiths, a UN veteran who believes this new effort is "obviously a reflection of the failure of the UN Security Council and of the UN writ large." But the former Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator cautioned that "what we've learned over these last 80 years, through lots and lots of failures and clunkiness, we learned the value of inclusion, of being representative of the global community, not just the friends of Mr Trump." Guterres himself recently regretted that "there are those that believe the power of law should be replaced by the law of power". Asked in an interview with the BBC's Today programme about Trump's constant claim that he's ended eight wars, he replied matter-of-factly "they are ceasefires." Some have already broken down. The temporary peace deal between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo soon fell apart, Cambodia and Thailand started hurling accusations and more across their border, and India disputed Trump's central role in ending its conflagration with Pakistan. But only Trump's muscular mediation could have ended the 12-day war between Iran and Israel. His own personal involvement finally secured a ceasefire in Gaza's destructive confrontation last October which eased both the suffering of Palestinians, and the agony of Israeli hostages. His decision to finally and fully focus on this disaster, partly in response to urging from his closest Arab allies and grieving Israeli families, pushed him to pressure Israel's Prime Minister Netanyahu and Hamas, to do a deal. But even the Board's first test – to move from the first phase of the deal to end the Gaza war – is daunting. Even now, as this new Board slowly takes shape, it includes Netanyahu who has vowed to stop the establishment of a Palestinian state, and Arab leaders who insist the only pathway to a sustainable peace must lead to Palestinian self-governance and the end of Israeli occupation. And the other big war on America's - and Europe's agenda - is Ukraine. President Zelensky has balked at being at the same table as Moscow and Minsk. Three layers lie beneath this Board, most focusing on Gaza – an Executive Board, a Gaza Executive Board, and the National Committee for the Administration for Gaza. They bring together a mix of senior American officials and billionaires, as well as respected former politicians and ex-UN envoys who know Gaza well, along with Arab ministers and intelligence chiefs, and Palestinian technocrats. Even some critics credit the president with putting an age-old battle of a different kind on the table – the incessant demand to reform the UN's post-war architecture including a Security Council which no longer aligns with the world's political map of major powers in every region. It's simply not fit for purpose. "Maybe an unintended good consequence of what Trump has done is those issues will be pushed back towards the top of the international agenda," reflected Mark Malloch Brown, the former UN deputy secretary-general. "We're coming out of a period of extremely weak UN leadership and I think this could be a call to action." Ironically, Trump's bid to lead the world towards peace comes as discussions gather steam in many capitals to replace Guterres who completes his second term at the end of this year. The president, who previously declared that he could end the Ukraine war in a day, has learned in his last year in power that peacemaking is a protracted and perilous process. But today he hailed a Middle East region where only "little fires" were burning now. He promised that a settlement in Ukraine "is coming very soon". And he revelled in his new role as would-be peacemaker-in-chief. "This is for the world" he exclaimed.

### 2. [Eight surprise takeaways from the Oscar nominations](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp3zzv40422o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

Eight surprise takeaways from the Oscar nominations Awards pundits were taken by surprise from the first two words spoken at the Oscar nominations on Thursday. "Elle Fanning, for Sentimental Value," said hosts Danielle Brooks and Lewis Pullman, as they kicked off the nominations with the best supporting actress category. Fanning's appearance got things off to a spicy start from the earliest possible moment - she had received praise for her performance in the Norwegian family drama but few had predicted a nomination. The opening category set the tone for a string of snubs and surprises, which started coming thick and fast. Here are eight of the big takeaways. 1. Some hot favourites missed out Although Hamnet and One Battle After Another did well, both had a slightly softer showing than expected in the acting categories. Paul Mescal missed out on a supporting actor nod for Hamnet - a surprising omission, although we're confident it won't have much impact on his co-star Jessie Buckley's frontrunner status for best actress. Meanwhile, four big actors from One Battle After Another were recognised, but its break-out star Chase Infiniti missed best actress despite being a red-hot contender. It was an admittedly competitive category. But at 25 years old and with rave reviews for her performance in the film, we're pretty sure we haven't heard the last of her. Other actors who had momentum but ended up missing included Jesse Plemons for Bugonia and Joel Edgerton for Train Dreams. But both of those movies made it into best picture - so the Academy clearly liked them overall. 2. F1 is a comfort-food movie F1, which stars Brad Pitt as a racing driver brought out of retirement, was the biggest surprise in the best picture category. It wasn't exactly an outsider - many awards pundits expected it to pick up several below-the-line nominations for its impressive technical achievements (we recommend watching the film in a cinema or with surround sound if you can). But the fact that it had enough momentum to propel it into best picture was a real show of strength - especially without other major nominations in best director or the acting categories. It shows the old guard of the Academy still appreciates traditional, well-made films that can simply be enjoyed with a bucket of popcorn. 3. Sinners were the big winners Sinners scored a record-breaking 16 nominations, flying way past the previous joint record holders La La Land, Titanic and All About Eve, which got 14 each. Ryan Coogler's vampire horror has done particularly well to maintain its momentum with voters, considering it was released last spring. But it's exactly the kind of film the Academy would want to recognise. Although vampire movies might not be traditional Oscars bait, Sinners was a real artistic achievement, blending genre horror with 1930s blues music against a backdrop of the Mississippi Delta. Coogler also made headlines in the Hollywood trade publications last year for the deal he negotiated with Warner Brothers, which will see the film's ownership rights return to him after 25 years. 4. Wicked did not bewitch the Academy The first Wicked film received 10 Oscar nominations and went on to win two. So it's an extraordinary fall from grace for its sequel to have got zero. This was largely expected, however. Wicked: For Good was far less well received than its predecessor - something it shares with the original musical. The second act of the stage show is widely considered weaker than the first, partly because all the big hits appear before the interval. But it was still thought that Wicked: For Good could get into some categories, with many predicting a best original song nomination for The Girl in the Bubble, a track performed by Ariana Grande that was newly added for the film adaptation. There was better news for another blockbuster, Avatar: Fire and Ash, which at least managed a couple of technical nominations for visual effects and costume design. Some of the most mainstream films can instead be found in the animated category. That's where we find the $1.7bn-grossing Zootopia 2 (known as Zootropolis 2 in the UK) and viral streaming hit KPop Demon Hunters. 5. The Brits showed up Sinners didn't just score the highest number of nominations, it also delivered the only two Brits to be nominated in the acting categories. Wunmi Mosaku and Delroy Lindo made it into best supporting actress and actor respectively. While Mosaku's was broadly expected, Lindo's was more of a surprise, and his inclusion is perhaps one of the biggest indicators of how much love there clearly is for Sinners across the Academy. Lindo narrowly missed a best actor nomination a few years ago for Spike Lee's Da 5 Bloods. The 73-year-old's first ever Oscar nomination feels long overdue. 6. Several actresses carried their films to a nomination Three of the actresses nominated on Thursday ended up being the only recognition their film received. Rose Byrne was the sole representation for motherhood drama If I Had Legs I'd Kick You, while Kate Hudson made it in on her own for the touching musical love story Song Sung Blue. Meanwhile, Weapons star Amy Madigan was nominated for her role as an eccentric aunt who shows up in a US town just before the local school children go missing. Madigan's nomination is perhaps the most impressive, given that jump-scare horror movies aren't traditional Oscars fodder. But the 75-year-old was a passion pick for many pundits and voters, and her fans have been campaigning hard for her to be recognised for her memorable (and slightly terrifying) performance. 7. New category is a mixed bag The newly introduced casting category overlapped with many of the general frontrunners, with nominations for Marty Supreme, One Battle After Another, Hamnet, Sinners and The Secret Agent. We can't help but feel slightly bemused, however, that one other film in particular missed out. Sentimental Value failed to score a casting nomination despite all four of its lead stars scoring individual nods - Stellan Skarsgård, Elle Fanning, Renate Reinsve and Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas. If that quartet was impressive enough to be nominated individually, you might've thought there was a good chance of recognition for the casting directors who put them together - Avy Kaufman and Yngvill Kolset Haga. 8. Timothée is even closer to greatness At the SAG Awards last year, Timothée Chalamet spoke about his desire to eventually be considered "one of the Hollywood greats". He's a big step closer to that with the likelihood that he will win his first Oscar this year, as the clear frontrunner in best actor for table-tennis drama Marty Supreme. Although he's only been nominated twice before, Chalamet is popular with the Academy, having starred in a whopping eight best picture-nominated films. He is also the youngest actor since Marlon Brando to receive three nominations for best leading actor. Brando was 30, the same age as Chalamet, when he got his third in 1954. Timothée came close to a win last year for playing Bob Dylan in A Complete Unknown, but we're confident that 2026 will be his time to reign supreme.

Trump sparks anger over claim Nato troops avoided Afghanistan front line Donald Trump has sparked fresh outrage in the UK after saying Nato troops stayed "a little off the front lines" during the war in Afghanistan. Labour MP Emily Thornberry, the chair of the foreign affairs committee, called it an "absolute insult" to the 457 British service personnel killed in the conflict, while Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said: "How dare he question their sacrifice?" Conservative MP Ben Obese-Jecty, who served in Afghanistan, said it was "sad to see our nation's sacrifice, and that of our Nato partners, held so cheaply". The UK was among several allies to join the US in Afghanistan from 2001, after it invoked Nato's collective security clause following the 9/11 terror attacks. The US president told Fox News on Thursday that he was "not sure" the military alliance would be there for America "if we ever needed them". "We've never needed them," he said, adding: "We have never really asked anything of them." "They'll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan," he said, "and they did, they stayed a little back, a little off the front lines". He said the US had "been very good to Europe and to many other countries", adding: "It has to be a two-way street." Thornberry told the BBC's Question Time that the remarks were "much more than a mistake". "It's an absolute insult... How dare he say we weren't on the front line, how dare he? "We have always been there whenever the Americans have wanted us," she said, calling Trump "a man who has never seen any action" but was now "commander in chief and knows nothing about how it is that America has been defended". She said the US was the UK's "friend" but its leader had "behaved in a way that is bullying, rude, that has deliberately been trying to undermine us, which has been trying to undermine Nato." On the same programme, Conservative shadow cabinet member Stuart Andrew also called the comments "disgraceful" and "appalling". "There are many people in this country who served both in Iraq and Afghanistan, many of whom lost their lives, but also many more who came back with life-changing injuries and we should say thank you to them." He added that the UK-US special relationship was important for both defence and security, and that in recent weeks Trump had directed conversation to the security of the Arctic - where he said there was a "very serious threat". Sir Ed wrote on social media that Trump had "avoided military service", adding: "How dare he question their sacrifice?" Speaking to BBC's Newsnight programme, Dutch foreign minister David van Weel rejected Trump's remarks as "false", saying "Europeans shed blood" in support of US troops in Afghanistan. He said Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte had rebuffed similar comments Trump made earlier, during a joint press conference the pair held at Davos on Thursday. Asked about the US president repeating the claim, van Weel, said: "We should speak out for the truth as Mark Rutte did. And if he repeated it, we need to repeat it again because that's not how history went." Meanwhile, former British Army officer Obese-Jecty said it was "sad to see our nation's sacrifice, and that of our Nato partners, held so cheaply by the president of the United States". "I saw first hand the sacrifices made by British soldiers," he wrote on X. "I don't believe US military personnel share the view of President Trump; his words do them a disservice as our closest military allies." Calvin Bailey, a Labour MP and former RAF officer who served alongside US special operations units in Afghanistan, said the president's claim bore "no resemblance to the reality experienced by those of us who served there". "As I reminded the US Forces I served with on 4 July 2008, we were there because of a shared belief, articulated at America's founding, that free people have inalienable rights and should not live under tyranny," he told the PA news agency. "That belief underpinned the response to 9/11, and it is worth reflecting on now." The BBC approached the Ministry of Defence for comment. A spokesperson pointed to comments made by Defence Secretary John Healey while visiting Nato ally Denmark on Wednesday - before Trump's comments. He said: "In Afghanistan, our forces trained together, they fought together, and on some occasions, they died together, making the ultimate sacrifice." The US invaded in October 2001 to oust the Taliban, whom they said were harbouring Osama Bin Laden and other al-Qaeda figures linked to the 9/11 attacks. Nato nations contributed troops and military equipment to the US-led war. More than 3,500 coalition soldiers had died as of 2021, when the US withdrew from the country - about two-thirds of them Americans. The UK suffered the second highest number of military deaths in the conflict behind the US, which saw 2,461 deaths. The US is the only country to have invoked the collective security provisions of Nato's Article 5, which states that "an armed attack against one Nato member shall be considered an attack against them all".

'Blood was all over' - victim of Nigeria church abduction describes escape There was a huge plaster on Sarah Peter's head to staunch the bleeding caused by the blow of a gunman's weapon. Sarah, not her real name, was in church in a village in northern Nigeria on Sunday morning when attackers raided the compound to abduct the worshippers and take them away on foot. The 60-year-old was whacked on the skull with a rifle to encourage her to move. "Blood was all over," she said, her fingers brushing the area where the wound was. "I suffered," she added, clearly still traumatised by what happened three days earlier. "They kept dragging me even when I told them I couldn't walk. Then I hid somewhere until I couldn't see them any more. I was so weak I had to crawl back to the village." Dozens of others were taken away from her branch of the Cherubim and Seraphim Movement Church and two other churches in Kurmin Wali, a village 135km (84 miles) north of the capital, Abuja. Although 11 people managed to escape, including Sarah, more than 160 people are still unaccounted for, according to the local branch of the Christian Association of Nigeria. The remaining villagers have been left devastated and fear more attacks. Authorities have not released any figures for those missing. Kurmin Wali is near Kaduna state's Rijana forest, a hideout for armed gangs, known here as "bandits", who have been carrying out raids and abductions in the region. No group has said it was behind Sunday's raid, but the attack is part of a wider security crisis in Nigeria, with kidnapping for ransom becoming more common. Paying kidnappers is illegal in Nigeria but it is often suspected that money has been handed over to free those who have been abducted. In this case, no ransom demand has been reported. There has been an increasing international focus on the issue after US President Donald Trump alleged last year that Christians were being targeted and killed in record numbers. Last month, the US military carried out air strikes on camps of suspected Islamist militants in Nigeria's north-west. Nigerian officials have denied that Christians were being singled out because of their faith, and have said Muslims, Christians and those with no religion have all been affected by the insecurity. There is an air of tension and anger in Kurmin Wali. The village head said people had been living in fear for a while. Local residents have been urging authorities to improve security and have accused them of trying to suppress information in the wake of Sunday's raid. Forty-eight hours of confusion followed the attack as officials initially denied anything had happened, despite eyewitness reports, only to finally confirm events on Tuesday evening. "They told us not to give out any information, they want to intimidate us but we must tell our story. They have also been stopping some journalists from coming to the town," said a young man in his 20s, who wished to remain anonymous. It is not clear why the authorities may have been reluctant for news to get out, but Kaduna state governor Uba Sani told the BBC that officials wanted to confirm details first before making any statements. However, that does not explain why the local police chief and a state official initially denied there had been any attack, describing the reports as a "mere falsehood which is being peddled by conflict entrepreneurs who want to cause chaos". The BBC also faced difficulties reaching Kurmin Wali, after a politician and security personnel attempted to block access to the village. But we managed to get through and once inside, we found a scene of chaos in the building of the Cherubim and Seraphim Movement Church. Colourful plastic chairs were on their sides, prayer books scattered on the floor and musical instruments broken, as if the moment after the attack had been frozen in time. Nearby, Christopher Yohanna was looking forlornly at his two-year-old daughter. He said he managed to escape from the attackers with his child. "We were in the church when we heard shouting. When we came out and tried to run, we saw that gunmen had already surrounded the village." He was lucky not to be caught, but he is devastated because his two wives and other children were not so lucky. "If my family is not with me then my life is worthless and free of any joy," he said. Governor Sani was in Kurmin Wali three days after the attack, pledging to establish a military base, a hospital and a road in the area. He also announced relief measures for affected residents, including medical support. "We cannot relocate them because they have to farm… but to ensure that we protect them going forward, we need to have a military base around that area between that village and Rijana forest," he told the BBC. He also said efforts were under way to work with security agencies to rescue those still in captivity. "When we met [the villagers] I affirmed that we are with them and… we will not let any of them down." As the residents of Kurmin Wali wait anxiously for the return of their family members, they are hoping the governor keeps to his word. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

### 5. [France seizes suspected Russian 'shadow fleet' oil tanker in the Mediterranean](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdexxr2y907o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

France seizes suspected Russian 'shadow fleet' oil tanker in the Mediterranean France says it has seized an oil tanker in the Mediterranean suspected of being part of Russia's sanction-busting "shadow fleet". French President Emmanuel Macron said the tanker, named the Grinch, was "subject to international sanctions and suspected of flying a false flag". The French navy, with the assistance of allies including the UK, boarded the vessel on Thursday morning between Spain and Morocco. French maritime authorities said that a search of the vessel had "confirmed the doubts as to the regularity of the flag". Russia's embassy in Paris said it had not been informed of the seizure. Moscow's so-called shadow fleet is a clandestine network of tankers used to evade Western sanctions on Russian oil exports by shipping the oil on aged tankers with obscure ownership or insurance. The Grinch was travelling from the Arctic port of Murmansk in northern Russia when it was intercepted, French authorities said. The vessel had been flying a Comoros flag, according to ship tracking websites marinetraffic and vesselfinder. Announcing the seizure on X, Macron said: "We are determined to uphold international law and to ensure the effective enforcement of sanctions. "The activities of the "shadow fleet" contribute to financing the war of aggression against Ukraine," he said, adding that the vessel had been "diverted". Defence Secretary John Healy said the UK navy had provided "tracking and monitoring" support, with HMS Dagger monitoring the tanker through the Straits of Gibraltar. He added: "Alongside our allies, we are stepping up our response to shadow vessels to choke off the funds that fuel Putin's illegal invasion of Ukraine." The UK has imposed sanctions on 544 Russian shadow fleet vessels. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky welcomed the action, saying it was "exactly the kind of resolve needed to ensure that Russian oil no longer finances Russia's war". "Vessels must be apprehended. And wouldn't it be fair to confiscate and sell the oil carried by these tankers?" he said on X. Speaking at Davos earlier, Zelensky exhorted Europe to do more to ensure its own security, saying: "Europe loves to discuss the future but avoids taking action". Many Western countries imposed sanctions on Russian energy following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Earlier in January, British armed forces supported a US operation to seize a Russian-flagged tanker in the Atlantic that US officials said had broken sanctions by carrying oil for Venezuela and Russia. Moscow denounced the move, saying no state had the right to use force against vessels properly registered in other states' jurisdictions. Last October, France seized another sanctioned tanker, the Boracay, off its west coast before releasing it a few days later. Shadow fleets are becoming increasingly common, with Venezuela, Iran and Russia all accused of using them to avoid sanctions on oil. Financial intelligence firm S&P Global estimates that one in five oil tankers worldwide are used to smuggle oil from sanctioned countries.

**Excerpt**

German nurse jailed for murders could be linked to 100 more deaths An ex-nurse convicted of murdering 10 patients in western Germany may be linked to more than 100 additional deaths, an official has said. The chief public prosecutor in Aachen, Katja Schlenkermann-Pitts, told the BBC that there was "a correspondingly high number of suspicious cases" under review. She cautioned that the cases represented preliminary suspicions and that some could be dismissed following forensic examination. In November last year, a regional court in Aachen convicted the former palliative care nurse, who has not been publicly named, of 10 counts of murder and 27 counts of attempted murder, sentencing him to life imprisonment. The court found that during night shifts at a hospital in Würselen, the man had administered excessive doses of sedatives and painkillers to seriously ill patients without medical justification. Prosecutors said the drugs were sometimes given repeatedly and that the defendant was aware of the potentially fatal consequences. Judges concluded that the actions were driven by personal unease and a desire to impose order during night shifts. The defendant denied the charges during the trial in Aachen, stating that he had intended to help patients sleep and had not believed the medication posed a lethal risk given their underlying illnesses. But prosecutors told the court that he showed "irritation" and a lack of empathy to patients who required a higher level of care, and accused him of playing "master of life and death". The offences examined in the initial trial occurred between December 2023 and May 2024 at the Rhein-Maas hospital in Würselen, where the nurse had worked since 2020. The newly identified suspected cases relate largely to earlier periods. As part of the expanded inquiry, investigators have ordered around 60 exhumations. Twenty seven have already been carried out, with roughly 30 more pending. Schlenkermann-Pitts said autopsy results were still outstanding in many cases and would determine whether further charges could be brought. "Of course, they may still be dropped," she cautioned. Prosecutors in Cologne are also examining deaths linked to hospitals where the nurse worked before his transfer to Würselen, 65km (40 miles) away. Two exhumations have taken place so far, including the remains of a 94 year old woman who died in 2018, and a 78 year old patient who died in 2015. Further exhumations have been ordered. Prosecutors in both Aachen and Cologne said preparations for potential new charges were under way, but officials said that any further proceedings were unlikely to begin before 2027. The case bears similarity to that of former nurse Niels Högel, who was handed a life sentence in 2019 after he was convicted of murdering 85 patients at two hospitals in northern Germany. Högel is believed to be the most prolific killer in Germany's modern history.

Ubisoft cancels six games including Prince of Persia and closes studios Ubisoft has cancelled six video games - including its long-awaited Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake - as part of a "major reset" of its operations. The French developer and publisher, known for popular games such as Assassin's Creed, Far Cry and Just Dance, has closed two studios and delayed seven titles as part of its changes. Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot said the move would "create the conditions for a return to sustainable growth". The firm's shares plunged by 33% on Thursday morning following the announcement. The move comes at a time when studios are increasingly turning to video game remakes and remasters, with new versions of Super Mario Galaxy, Oblivion and Metal Gear Solid 3 proving popular in 2025. So the decision to bin the remake of Sands of Time - which sold millions of copies in 2003 - has left many fans scratching their heads. Ubisoft has not specified which titles it has discontinued alongside the Prince of Persia remake. But it says among them are four unannounced titles, including three based on new intellectual property, and a mobile game. Ubisoft has closed its studios in Stockholm, Sweden and Halifax, Canada as part of the move, which will include restructuring three others. The developers were working on a new intellectual property (IP) and mobile titles for Assassin's Creed, respectively. The closure of Ubisoft Halifax was previously announced in January - the same week the studio formed a union. "While these decisions are difficult, they are necessary for us to build a more focused, efficient and sustainable organisation over the long term," Guillemot said. "Taken together, these measures mark a decisive turning point for Ubisoft and reflect our determination to confront challenges head-on to reshape the Group for the long term". Gaming industry analyst Piers Harding-Rolls told the BBC the move indicated the firm was trying to mitigate risk. "It's less risky to maintain scale by investing in existing big franchises such as Assassin's Creed and Rainbow Six than launch entirely new IPs and that's reflected in the cancellation of a number of games based on new IPs," he said. 'Rising development costs' It is the second restructure from Ubisoft in subsequent years, after the firm cut 185 jobs across Europe in 2025. In the UK, it closed its office in Leamington and restructured another in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. Guillemot said the new move was in part due to a competitive market for triple-A games - blockbuster titles which cost millions to develop and dominate large studios' offerings. "On the one hand, the triple-A industry has become persistently more selective and competitive with rising development costs and greater challenges in creating brands," he said in a statement on Wednesday. Such big offerings are increasingly facing delays - with Grand Theft Auto VI pushed back for a second time to November 2026. But Guillemot said despite these hurdles, successful blockbuster games could bring "more financial potential than ever". "In this context, today we are announcing a major reset built to create the conditions for a return to sustainable growth over time," he said. Ubisoft will now focus on developing open world adventure games - which let players freely navigate vast environments - and live service games which seek regular payments from players. The firm said its subsidiary Vantage Studios, created after a €1.25bn ($1.25bn; £1bn) investment from Chinese tech giant Tencent, would aim to turn Assassin's Creed, Far Cry and Rainbow Six "into annual billionaire brands".

**Excerpt**

UN to take over al-Hol camp for IS families in Syria after unrest The United Nations (UN) says it will take over management of a camp in north-eastern Syria holding holding thousands of people with alleged links to the jihadist group Islamic State (IS). It comes after Kurdish-led forces that had been running the camp withdrew in the face of an advance by Syrian government forces, triggering unrest that forced aid agencies to suspend operations. Residents were reported to have rushed camp perimeters in an apparent attempt to escape, prompting unrest and looting. A ceasefire agreement has brought much of Syria's north-east under the control of Damascus, ending years of autonomous Kurdish rule. Briefing the UN Security Council on Thursday, UN official Edem Wosornu said the UN refugee agency UNHCR had "taken over camp management responsibilities" at al-Hol and was working with Syrian authorities to restore humanitarian access. Syrian forces, she said, had established a security perimeter around the camp. However, UN spokesman Stéphane Dujarric cautioned that conditions inside remained "tense and volatile", with humanitarian operations still suspended following the violence. Meanwhile, the US has launched a parallel effort to remove high-risk detainees from the region altogether. US Central Command said on Wednesday that it had begun transferring up to 7,000 suspected IS fighters from prisons in northeast Syria to Iraq, confirming that 150 detainees had already been moved to a "secure location" across the border. Iraqi authorities said all transferred detainees would be prosecuted under Iraqi law. "This is a measure aimed at protecting regional and international security from an imminent threat. Nevertheless, we stress that this issue should not be left to become a long-term strategic burden on Iraq alone," Iraq's deputy UN ambassador, Mohammed Sahib Mejid Marzooq, said. Syria's UN ambassador Ibrahim Olabi said the Syrian government welcomed the US operation to transfer IS detainees out of Syrian territory and was ready to offer support. Rights groups have warned that the transfers could expose detainees to serious abuses. The Reprieve charity said it believed up to ten British men could be among those transferred, along with juvenile detainees and urged the UK government to intervene urgently. Around 55 to 60 British nationals, most of them children, remain detained across camps and prisons in the region, it said. "The prisoners transferred face being tortured, sentenced to death and executed, without being granted any meaningful opportunity to contest the allegations against them", Katherine Cornett, Reprieve's deputy director told the BBC. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), US and UN have long called for the repatriation of foreign IS suspects and their families from north-eastern Syria, citing the political instability and dire conditions in the prisons and camps, but many countries have refused to take them.

Outrage after Indian man drowns in open pit after begging for help for hours The death of a 27-year-old Indian IT professional after his car fell into an unmarked construction pit has raised questions around urban planning and road safety in India. Last Friday, at around midnight, Yuvraj Mehta was driving home in Noida, a suburb of the capital Delhi, through dense winter fog when his car reportedly hit a low boundary wall and plunged into the deep pit full of water. The site had reportedly been dug up a few years ago before work was stalled. Mehta, who didn't know how to swim, climbed on to the roof of his car as it began to sink and rang his father who rushed to the scene and alerted the emergency services. His father told reporters that Mehta remained there for close to two hours, flashing the torch on his phone and shouting for help. Then, his cries stopped. By the time authorities recovered his body, almost five hours had passed since the accident, local media reported. Mehta's tragic death has made national headlines, and the fact that it happened so close to the capital city has shocked and angered residents. Protests have been held at the accident site, with demonstrators accusing authorities of negligence and demanding accountability. His death has also fuelled larger questions about the state of Indian roads and urban planning. "Noida techie's [Mehta's] death is essentially a murder. Dreams shattered. Hard work gone in vain. Father's hopes buried. All because of a failed system," one user wrote on X. "This tragedy raises deeper questions about the quality of infrastructure in even big cities like Noida," said another. Some users shared their own experiences of accidents because of bad roads, lack of adequate signage and poor lighting after dark. Some also complained about open drains and construction sites on roads close to their homes becoming death traps, especially for children and the elderly. Since the accident, police in Noida have registered two cases against the real estate developers of the construction site where the pit was located following a complaint from Mehta's family. On Sunday, the government of Uttar Pradesh state, where Noida is located, removed a senior official from the township's governing authority and ordered an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the rescue operation and site safety. Since then, police have arrested Abhay Kumar, one of the owners of the construction site, for alleged culpable homicide due to negligence under India's criminal code. Kumar is in custody and has not commented on the allegations. Police have said that further investigations are under way and that more arrests are likely in the coming days. In media interviews, Mehta's father Rajkumar has said that he received a call from his son soon after the accident happened. He rushed to the spot but said that the site was pitch dark and shrouded in fog, and that his son was barely visible in the murky waters. He alerted the police and the fire brigade and said that rescue teams arrived at the site shortly after. But he alleged that his son remained stranded for hours because they did not have the resources to pull him out. He added that his son's life could have been saved if trained divers were sent to retrieve him, but that did not happen. "He was constantly saying, 'Papa mujhe bacha lo' [Papa save me] during his last hours," Rajkumar Mehta told NDTV news channel. Moninder, who goes by one name and is a delivery worker for an e-commerce platform, was passing by and reportedly made a brave attempt to save Mehta. He tied a rope around his waist and jumped into the freezing water to pull him out, he told Hindustan Times newspaper.. He added that he searched for Mehta for 30-40 minutes but couldn't locate him. He also alleged that emergency responders weren't willing to step inside the water, saying that it was too cold and that there were iron rods inside the pit. Noida's additional commissioner of police Rajeev Narain Mishra told the media that the incident was "unfortunate" but denied negligence. "Police and fire department teams made efforts to save the youth. A fire department crane, ladder, makeshift boat and searchlights were used, but there was zero visibility at the time," he told Times of India newspaper and added that further investigation was under way. Hemant Upadhyay, assistant commissioner of police for Noida, told British newspaper The Independent that no-one was sent into the pit because officers were concerned about further casualties if untrained personnel were sent in. "The water was very deep, visibility was poor and there were concerns about submerged debris," he said.

**Excerpt**

Trump's son called UK police after seeing woman 'beat up', court hears Donald Trump's youngest son contacted UK police saying he witnessed a friend in London being "beat up" during a video call, a court has heard. Barron Trump, 19, told police he had friends call 999 from the US so that he could report the alleged attack in January 2025. Matvei Rumiantsev, 22, is on trial at Snaresbrook Crown Court accused of assault and two counts of rape, among other charges, against the alleged victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons He denies assault, actual bodily harm, two counts of rape, intentional strangulation and perverting the course of justice by pressuring the woman to withdraw her complaints. Trump called the alleged victim on 18 January last year, the court heard. Shortly after placing the call, the US president's fifth child contacted the police and said she was being assaulted. "I'm calling from the US, uh I just got a call from a girl, you know, she's getting beat up," he said, according to a transcript of the call released by the Crown Prosecution Service. "This was happening about eight minutes ago. I just figured out how to, how to call someone. Uh, uh it's really an emergency." When asked by the operator how he knows the woman, he said: "I don't think these details matter, she's getting beat up but OK fine, also I met her on social media, I don't think that matters." The operator responded: "Can you stop being rude and actually answer my questions?" Trump was later asked by police to provide a witness statement and said in an email on 2 May that what he saw had been "very brief indeed but indeed prevalent". He said he had not expected that his call to the woman would be answered because of the time difference, but it was picked up by "a shirtless man with darkish hair". "This view lasted maybe one second", he said, adding the view then flipped to the victim getting hit while crying. "This whole interaction had lasted five to seven seconds." He continued: "I made two of my friends call the Met Police in the UK, even though they are in the US. "As per evidence I do not have any, I was told by the victim who I am very close with that this individual was giving her difficulty for a long time." Rumiantsev denies the charges, which date between November 2024 and January 2025. Prosecutors allege Rumiantsev strangled the woman the evening of 17 January last year. She later called the police, and the Russian national was arrested on the morning of 18 January and taken into custody. The defendant told jurors that the two had been drinking together that night and into the early morning, and had consensual sex during that time. Giving evidence on Thursday, Rumiantsev said an argument broke out and that the woman was "completely hysterical, crying, screaming, shouting at me". He said he had held her arms in self-defence to prevent her from hitting him. "I noticed her phone next to me on the sofa and it was ringing with a Barron Trump face call," the defendant told the court. He said he was not sure why he answered the call, but that maybe he hoped "that she wouldn't behave like this in front of someone else." Earlier, the Russian national told the court that he learned about the woman's friendship with Trump in October 2024 - when she asked him to take a photograph of a chat between them on her phone. The court also heard he and the alleged victim had had a disagreement in November 2024. Rumiantsev said that he had felt "upset" about her talking to Trump. But he said: "I was in no way controlling but I was trying to make her know that if she feels unwell seeing messages I had with girls 10 years ago, she could maybe understand how I felt when she was sat there this moment texting someone else." The trial continues.

**Excerpt**

Vampire film Sinners breaks Oscar nominations record Vampire horror film Sinners has broken the record for the most Oscar nominations received by a single film, after being nominated for 16 of Hollywood's most coveted honours. The film beat the previous record of 14 nominations, and emerged ahead of its nearest rival this year, Leonardo DiCaprio's thriller One Battle After Another, which is up for 13 awards. Sinners' contenders include its star Michael B Jordan and his British co-stars Wunmi Mosaku and Delroy Lindo. Other big names up for trophies include Timothée Chalamet, who is hoping for third time lucky after two previous nominations, and Irish actress Jessie Buckley, who is the frontrunner to win best actress for Hamnet. However, there was no space for her co-star Paul Mescal, who starred opposite Buckley as William Shakespeare in Hamnet; while Wicked: For Good and its stars Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande missed out completely. The winners will be announced at a ceremony in Hollywood on 15 March. The leading films: Sinners - 16 - One Battle After Another - 13 - Marty Supreme - 9 - Frankenstein - 9 - Sentimental Value - 9 - Hamnet - 8 - Sinners 'more than just a horror' Sinners has exceeded expectations and bucked the trend that normally means horror films don't perform well at award ceremonies. It beat the previous record total of 14 nominations, achieved by All About Eve in 1951, Titanic in 1998 and La La Land in 2018. Michael B Jordan is nominated for best actor for playing twin brothers who return home to Mississippi in the 1930s to set up a juke joint, which is set upon by blood-sucking vampires. Other Sinners cast members to be nominated include British-Nigerian actress Wunmi Mosaku and co-star Delroy Lindo, who grew up in London, and the pair are carrying Britain's hopes for acting awards this year. Ryan Coogler is nominated for directing, writing and producing Sinners, with the film also shortlisted for the Oscars' top prize, best picture. BBC Radio 1 film critic Ali Plumb said: "The last time anything to do with a horror won best picture was The Silence of the Lambs in the early 1990s. That is a long time ago." He said it was good to see Sinners get "this broad a series of accolades and thumbs up from across the whole industry". It is "more than just a horror", he added. "Although obviously vampires are obviously involved, there's so much more to it." BBC culture editor Katie Razzall said: "It is to my mind the perfect blend of revenge thriller and sexy, decadent, musical journey through America's race issues, good against evil, the power of music - and redemption. "Who knew that combining vampires, KKK racists, ex-gangster twins (both played by Michael B Jordan), Mississippi delta folklore and blues history would pay off so spectacularly?" Losing the battle but winning the war? While Sinners deals with the spectre of racism in the American South, One Battle After Another gives a take on the current messy political climate in the US. Leonardo DiCaprio is nominated for best actor for playing a revolutionary battling an authoritarian US regime, whose past comes back to haunt him. The film has also scooped nominations for supporting cast members Benicio Del Toro, Sean Penn and Teyana Taylor, as well as director Paul Thomas Anderson. It has been the presumed favourite to win best picture throughout award season so far, and it could still pip Sinners to the top trophy in March. The frontrunner in the nominations doesn't always turn out to be the big winner on the night. In the past 21 years, the movie with the most nominations has gone on to win best picture just six times. Either way, the nominations are good news for Warner Bros, which made both Sinners and One Battle After Another, as it is in the process of being sold, possibly to Netflix. Chalamet eyes first Oscar DiCaprio and Jordan will face stiff competition from Timothee Chalamet, who is hotly tipped to win his first Oscar for his role in table tennis caper Marty Supreme. At 30, he has become the youngest man to receive three acting nominations since Marlon Brando. This year's best actor category is completed by Ethan Hawke, who has his fifth Oscar nomination for Blue Moon, and Brazilian actor Wagner Moura (The Secret Agent). At 37, Emma Stone has become the youngest woman to accumulate seven Oscar nominations after being recognised for Bugonia. She is listed for best actress alongside Kate Hudson (Song Sung Blue), Rose Byrne (If I Had Legs I'd Kick You) and Norway's Renate Reinsve (Sentimental Value) - but Buckley is regarded as the clear favourite in that race. Moura and Reinsve are among a record four acting nominations for non-English language performances - the others being Sweden's Stellan Skarsgård and Norwegian actress Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas, who are both in supporting categories for Sentimental Value. KPop characters v rock stars Fan favourite KPop Demon Hunters has been recognised in the Oscar nominations, too. The animated Netflix hit is in pole position to win best animated feature and best song, for mega-hit Golden. Co-writer of the track, Mark Sonnenblick, told BBC Newsbeat's Pete Allison that Thursday's Academy recognition had been the "icing on the cake". "The only reason that this morning [in Los Angeles] happened, regardless of the quality of the song or the movie or any of that, is just because fans responded to it and told other people to watch it and repost it and made fan videos," he said. There's no room, though, for the Wicked sequel. This time last year, the first film received 10 nominations, and the follow-up had been widely expected to join Golden in the best song race (for The Girl in the Bubble) and be nominated for prizes like best costume and make-up. But it missed out. Elsewhere in the music categories, Nick Cave is nominated for best song for the title song from Train Dreams, and Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood is nominated for best original score for One Battle After Another. Other British nominees include fellow composer Nicholas Pike, who is up for best original song for Viva Verdi!; while Northern Irish author Maggie O'Farrell is nominated for a screenplay award for adapting her novel Hamnet alongside director Chloe Zhao. Zhao has become only the second woman to be nominated for multiple best director Oscars, after Jane Campion. Zhao won that award for Nomadland in 2021. Meanwhile, the best documentary feature category includes Mr Nobody Against Putin, a BBC Storyville co-production.

**Excerpt**

Behind the scenes of Help 2, the star-studded charity album Damon Albarn is standing in the doorway of Abbey Road's canteen, deep in conversation with The Libertines' Carl Barat. Nearby, Pulp are queueing for a fresh batch of lasagne. Around them, half a dozen of children are running around, filming everything on handheld cameras. All of them are excitedly awaiting the arrival of Olivia Rodrigo. These were the scenes in London last November, as some of the world's biggest stars convened to record a new charity album in aid of Warchild. The tracklist, revealed yesterday, is like a who's who of indie rock. Wet Leg, The Last Dinner Party, Wolf Alice, Fontaines DC, Nilüfer Yanya, Cameron Winter, Ezra Collective, Foals and Young Fathers all contribute. Over the course of one week, 23 tracks were recorded. At times, five of Abbey Road's famed studios were in use, with collaborations springing up on the spur of the moment. Blur's Graham Coxon plays guitar with Rodrigo on a cover of The Magnetic Fields' The Book Of Love. Damon Albarn's session saw him joined by Johnny Marr on guitar, with additional vocals by Kae Tempest and Grian Chatten. Later in the day, Jarvis Cocker got back from a bathroom break to find them all in his studio - so he got them to sing the intro to a new Pulp song, Begging For Change. "The just turned up, so I thought, 'Why not?'" he laughs. "I'm not used to that kind of thing, but it was really good." The album is the spritual successor to 1995's Help! - recorded at the height of Britpop, and featuring contributions from Paul Weller, Radiohead, Suede, Paul McCartney, The KLF, Portishead and The Manic Street Preachers. It was also, famously, the only time Oasis and Blur appeared on the same record, just months after their legendary (and acrimonious) chart battle. "We'll put aside our differences for the cause," Noel Gallagher said at the time. "And it's the only time you'll see us agreeing on anything." The record sold 70,000 copies in its first week, raising nearly £1.25m to help children in war-stricken areas, such as Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 2025, the fund-raising is even more urgent. According to Warchild, 520 million children worldwide - almost one in five - are affected by war, with simultaneous crises in Ukraine, Sudan and Gaza. The figure is higher than any time since the Second World War, at the same time as governments across the world are cutting international aid. "At the moment, there really does seem to be a lot of bad things happening, and a lot of people feel powerless," says Cocker. "They're looking at the news and they don't know what to do. So I would hope this album is something the people can enjoy, and also know that they're trying to make a positive change." The first single, released on Thursday, is a new track by Arctic Monkeys called Opening Night. A sparse, sinister ballad, it finds Alex Turner singing about political sloganeering and "supercomputer crusades" before a beautifully harmonised chorus that offers a message of hope in dark times. The song dates back a couple of years, drummer Matt Helders tells the BBC, but had never been finished. Getting the call from Warchild was the prompt they needed to complete the song, with lyrics that felt like a call to arms. "With charity records, it's often tempting to do a cover, or an interesting collaboration," he says, "but we enjoy making records and being in the studio, so it was fun to work on something that we'd written." Adding to the fun was that film crew of children, principally aged between eight and 10, who documented the entire recording progress. They were corralled by Bafta-winning director Jonathan Glazer (Sexy Beast, Under The Skin, The Zone Of Interest), who wanted to connect the music back to the young people it would help. "They were given free reign to just roam around, which really changed the atmosphere," says Helders. "Studios can be quite a stiff, clinical environment, sometimes. But they were walking around and bumping into stuff. It made it fun." Cocker wasn't so sure. "I hate anybody watching me sing in the studio, because I'm kind of a self-conscious person and somebody pointing a camera at me doesn't help with that," he says. "And while I was singing in there, I think they were getting a bit bored, so they were just like lying on the floor and filming the ceiling." Ultimately, he found the children's presence liberating. Something about their total lack of interest allowed him to shed the idea that the studio recording has to capture "the perfect, definitive version" of a song. As a result, Pulp's contribution to Help 2 - Begging For Change - has a loose, live band feeling that really exemplifies the album's spontaneity and sense of community. In fact, the youthful camera crew even made it onto the record. "It's an interesting thing, you know, because kids are always told, 'Shut up, because I'm trying to think', or, 'Shhh, your dad's hungover'," he says. "So when they're given the chance to make a noise, they will do that. So what we tried to do on our song was to get them to scream, and they did it very well." You won't get to hear that song until Help 2 is released on 6 March. Thanks to record labels and pressing plants donating their services free of charge, it will be cheaper than standard albums - with a double vinyl costing around £26 - and Warchild receiving all the profits. "We found that this project really lit a fire under the creative community, " says Rich Clarke, the charity's head of music. "Lots of people wanted to get involved." He lets slip that the 23 tracks on the album weren't the only product of the week-long recording sessions. "There's a there's a whole load of tracks, around 10 or so, that that came in when people heard about the project. So actually, there were some tough decisions for the team about what made it onto the record." But Olivia Rodrigo's song - about the purity of love - was always earmarked as the closing track. "It's a really beautiful cover," says Clarke. "The record really takes you through a journey, with some powerful themes around conflict, but Olivia leaves you with a track about the redemptive power of love, which is a really poignant final note".

**Excerpt**

How Australian politics descended into ugliness after Bondi shooting Thursday had been earmarked for Australians to mourn the victims of last month's Bondi shootings. Those who had lost loved ones in the antisemitic attacks wanted it to be a chance to remember the dead, and spread light and kindness in their honour. Instead, it was a day dominated by a political row resulting in the collapse of the opposition coalition. "I mean, you would have thought they could have put this off for 24 hours," veteran political commentator Malcolm Farr told the BBC. "It's at the very least unfortunate timing and shows a certain amount of self-indulgence." The fight - which centred around reforms sparked by the tragedy - looks set to sink two leaders and trash their parties' electoral chances, and caps off what many Australians say has been a disappointing month of politics. When two gunmen opened fire on an event marking the Jewish festival of Hanukkah at Bondi Beach, killing 15 people - including a 10-year-old child - the recriminations began almost immediately. "The turnaround was amazing in the way they [politicians] politicised it," says Bondi local Kass Hill, 52. "The fingerpointing isn't solving anything." Heckles and blame While families were waiting to bury their loved ones, a conveyer belt of politicians - including the opposition leader - visited the scene to apportion blame. Populist leaders came to rail against immigration. Prominent businesspeople popped by to pose with flowers. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, accused by many Jewish Australians of ignoring their concerns ahead of the attack, spent the weeks after it dismissing calls from many in the community for a national inquiry into antisemitism. He was repeatedly heckled in public, arriving at a memorial to a tidal wave of boos and cries of "You're not welcome". "You might as well go to a jihadist nation where you can fit in," one person shouted. Looming over the crowd, a large screen read "a night of unity". Criticised as being overly defensive and slow to listen, Albanese has in turn rebuked his parliamentary rivals for "playing politics" with tragedy. The 14 December Bondi attack was Australia's worst mass shooting since the Port Arthur massacre in 1996, when 35 people were killed, but the responses to the tragedies couldn't be more different. Then Prime Minister John Howard visited the scene of the shooting in Tasmania to lay wreaths together with opposition leaders, who shortly afterwards united to help him pass firearms laws that made Australia a world leader on gun control. "Australian society and politics is very different than it was 30 years ago and we're just a far more divided society," says John Warhurst, an emeritus professor of political science at the Australian National University. A society already fractured over Israel-Gaza war There are a number of reasons why this attack has divided people in ways Port Arthur didn't - including the already fraught debate raging in Australia over Israel, Gaza and antisemitism, according to Mark Kenny, a political columnist and host of the Democracy Sausage podcast. "Then this event lobs into that, [and] I think it led to it being immediately politicised," he told the BBC. Since the 7 October 2023 attack on Israel by Hamas and protests in Australia against Israel's war on Gaza which followed, Albanese has consistently been accused of failing to do enough to stamp out antisemitism. The Executive Council of Australian Jewry says antisemitic incidents have increased from an average of 342 before the 7 October attacks in 2023 to 1,654 last year. Likewise, he's been accused of not doing enough to call out Israel's actions in Gaza, which UN experts have called genocide and Israel denies. Hours after the Bondi shooting, the antisemitism commissioner appointed by Albanese linked it to the pro-Palestinian protests that have regularly taken place in Sydney and which Jewish leaders have lobbied against. "It began on 9 October 2023 at the Sydney Opera House," Jillian Segal said in a statement. "Now death has reached Bondi Beach." Investigators have not said there is any link between the alleged gunmen and the pro-Palestinian movement, instead alleging the pair were inspired by the jihadist group Islamic State, with the younger of the father-son duo on intelligence agencies' radars for a period in 2019. No simple solutions and 'either-or-ism' As it was after Port Arthur, gun reform was the first thing on the legislative agenda after the Bondi attack. "We know that one of these terrorists held a firearm licence and had six guns, in spite of living in the middle of Sydney's suburbs... There's no reason why someone in that situation needed that many guns," Albanese said as he announced a suite of changes in the following days. Unlike Port Arthur, when the measures were broadly popular, Albanese's focus on gun laws was immediately attacked by the Liberal opposition and parts of the Jewish community as a distraction from what they view as the real cause of the attack – antisemitism. Even Howard, the architect of the 1996 reforms, came out to suggest they were an "attempted diversion". "That kind of 'either or ism' is a feature about politics these days probably everywhere in the West. Everything becomes supercharged and divisive," says Kenny. "There's just this fundamental lack of trust that's almost like we're in the grip of a toxic cynicism that means that motives of political leaders… the first instinct is to question them, to regard them as disingenuous." The recent decision by a festival in Adelaide to disinvite a Palestinian-Australian author – leading ultimately to the collapse of the entire writers' week portion of the event – due to "sensitivities" after Bondi and her "past statements" is also a sign of how tense the current circumstances are, adds Kenny. Demands for immediate action on antisemitism were loud in the days after the attack, and Albanese did soon announce a crackdown on hate speech, backed by the antisemitism commissioner. But some critics said the measures would impinge on free speech, including the right to criticise Israel, and on protest, while others argued they did not go far enough in protecting other minorities. "[It's] a can of worms," says Warhurst, noting that there has never been "an easy agreement on finding where that balance lies" between free speech and hate speech. "Now is the worst time, I think, to be trying to resolve those sorts of issues because you are doing it fairly quickly and you're doing it in a heated environment." The hate speech laws had the backing of the Jewish community, but many felt it was not enough - with several of the victims' families pushing Albanese to call a royal commission, Australia's most powerful form of independent inquiry. For weeks, Albanese argued the measures already announced were enough and that a royal commission would be the wrong tool to unpick what had happened. It could give a platform to antisemites, he said. Royal commissions had not been launched into previous tragedies like Port Arthur, Albanese pointed out, comments which were widely dismissed. Promised reviews of intelligence agencies and law enforcement similarly did nothing to dissuade those calling for the inquiry. Their pleas were mirrored by a coordinated campaign of letter writing that featured on the front pages of right-wing newspapers. "I don't think it's controversial to say that the News Limited and other parts of the media were certainly stirring the pot," says Warhurst. Albanese's arguments against a royal commission were "really hard to make in these circumstances", says Kenny, and it backfired on him when he was ultimately forced to reverse course on the issue. Analysts have also suggested his reluctance may have been down to fears it could become complex, controversial and divisive. It could invite discussion of the war in Gaza, while potentially excluding examination of Islamophobia – which exploded after Bondi, with The Islamophobia Register Australia recording a 740% rise in incidents by early January - when many Labor MPs have large Muslim electorates. There was likely also a "reluctance to cave to the opposition", Farr believes: opposition leader Sussan Ley had vociferously demanded the royal commission, asking what Albanese was "hiding", and revelled in his backflip. A political opportunity It is fair to say that, before December's attack, Ley had been struggling to land a punch on the government and assert authority over her own party. In the weeks before the shooting, some pundits were even predicting her imminent ousting. "The Bondi attacks offered her an opportunity to prosecute a very strong case against the government," says Kenny. But any momentum she gained over the royal commission collapsed this week when she failed to rally her Coalition behind the very hate speech laws she had so loudly demanded Albanese quickly implement. By Thursday - the national day of mourning for the Bondi attacks - things had fallen apart. The National Party announced they were leaving the coalition, having refused to vote for the legislation despite a shadow cabinet agreement. They, despite earlier calls for haste, said they had not been given enough time to examine the proposals which they said could threaten free speech. On his way out the door, Nationals leader David Littleproud suggested the only way his party would consider returning to the fold was if Ley was dumped, leaving her already shaky leadership hanging by a thread. "I'm quite sure there are people... who are polishing their shoes and tightening the knot on their ties to step forward should that vacancy occur or be forced," says Farr. However, Littleproud's bold ultimatum could be an overstep which costs him his own job, with mutterings that Liberals wouldn't accept him as a leader in any future coalition either. But then, it seems all of Australia's politicians may be on shakier ground. The posturing of the main parties over the past month has left a bitter taste in the mouths of many Australians. In a poll released earlier this week, Albanese's net approval rating had plunged to minus 11 from his previous score of zero in November, while Ley's approval rating - never high - barely budged at minus 28. The repeated calls for unity by politicians who simultaneously fail to heed their own statements will not have gone unnoticed, and Thursday's display of political infighting is unlikely to improve the fortunes of any party, says Farr. "It will reinforce the view of so many Australians who already are cynical about what politicians, no matter their party, actually represent and will reinforce the belief that politicians, MPs, just stand for themselves rather than the national good."

Board of Peace, Zelensky and Musk - What happened before Trump left Davos? Before President Donald Trump left the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday, he announced the creation of the Board of Peace and called it a "new international oversight body", though several key US allies were not present at a charter-signing ceremony. Trump also met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Elon Musk appeared at the forum for the first time to talk about space and AI. The BBC's Faisal Islam is in Davos and runs through the day's highlights.
