Harry says sacrifices by Nato troops in Afghanistan deserve 'respect' The Duke of Sussex has called for the sacrifices of Nato troops to be "spoken about truthfully and with respect", after the US president claimed allies stayed "a little back" from the front lines in Afghanistan. "I served there. I made lifelong friends there. And I lost friends there," Prince Harry, who was twice deployed to the country, said on Friday as he paid tribute to Nato troops killed in the conflict, including 457 UK service personnel. The prince was reacting to controversial comments made by Donald Trump in an interview on Thursday. Trump's words have drawn condemnation from international allies, with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer calling them "insulting and frankly appalling" . The UK and other nations joined the US in Afghanistan after Nato's collective security clause was invoked following the 9/11 attacks. Prince Harry said: "In 2001, Nato invoked Article 5 for the first - and only - time in history. It meant that every allied nation was obliged to stand with the United States in Afghanistan, in pursuit of our shared security. Allies answered that call." He added: "Thousands of lives were changed forever. Mothers and fathers buried sons and daughters. Children were left without a parent. Families are left carrying the cost. "Those sacrifices deserve to be spoken about truthfully and with respect, as we all remain united and loyal to the defence of diplomacy and peace." The duke's comments follow Trump's Fox News interview in which he said: "We've never needed them. We have never really asked anything of them. "They'll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan... and they did, they stayed a little back, a little off the front lines." The president also said he was "not sure" the military alliance would be there for the US "if we ever needed them". In the UK, Trump's remarks were condemned across the UK's political divide. Shortly before the prince's statement, Sir Keir gave his own reaction saying if he himself had "misspoken in that way" he would "certainly apologise". Sir Keir said: "I will never forget their courage, their bravery and the sacrifice they made for their country. "There were many also who were injured, some with life-changing injuries. "I consider President Trump's remarks to be insulting and frankly appalling and I am not surprised they have caused such hurt to the loved ones of those who were killed or injured and, in fact, across the country." Outside of the UK, ministers from foreign governments also criticised Trump's remarks. Poland's foreign minister Radoslaw Sikorski, who was among 33,000 Polish troops who served on the frontline in Afghanistan, said: "No one has the right to mock the service of our soldiers". Canada's Minister of National Defence David J McGuinty said that Canadian "men and women were on the ground from the beginning, not because we had to, but because it was the right thing to do." He said 158 of their troops "paid the ultimate price" for leading allied efforts in the Kandahar Province. Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, former secretary general of Nato during the Afghanistan War, told the BBC World Service: "No American president should have the liberty to belittle their legacy and to insult the ones who are still grieving the fact that they didn't come back alive from Afghanistan. "What I would expect is a sincere apology from the president of the United States." In October 2001 the US invaded Afghanistan to oust the Taliban, whom they said were harbouring Osama Bin Laden and other al-Qaeda figures linked to the 9/11 attacks. Nato nations contributed troops and military equipment to the US-led war. More than 3,500 coalition soldiers had died, about two-thirds of them Americans, as of 2021 when the US withdrew from the country. The UK suffered the second-highest number of military deaths in the conflict behind the US, which saw 2,461 fatalities. Most of the 457 British troops who died serving in Afghanistan over a period of nearly 20 years were killed in Helmand - the scene of the heaviest fighting. Hundreds more suffered injuries and lost limbs - including Cpl Andy Reid who lost both his legs and his right arm after stepping on an improvised explosive device (IED) in Afghanistan. "Not a day goes by when we're not in some kind of pain, physically or mentally reflecting on that conflict," he told BBC Breakfast. Reid recalled working with American soldiers during his time in Afghanistan, adding: "If they were on the front line and I was stood next to them, clearly we were on the front line as well." Diane Dernie, whose son Ben Parkinson suffered severe injuries when an Army Land Rover hit a mine near Musa Qala in 2006, said Trump's words were "so insulting" and hard to hear. The 41-year-old is currently recuperating after another operation, but Dernie told the BBC that Trump's comments showed "a childish man trying to deflect from his own actions". Dernie called on Starmer to "stand up for his own armed forces" and call out the US president. Her comments were put to the prime minister who replied: "I've made my position clear, and what I say to Diane is, if I had misspoken in that way or said those words, I would certainly apologise and I'd apologise to her." Giving a second interview to the BBC moments after Starmer's statement, Dernie said the prime minister's words were strong enough - but said he should go further. "His words were exactly what we wanted to hear, but we need those words to be addressed directly to the president," Dernie said. "I appreciate what Starmer has said, but they need to be said to Donald Trump." Throughout Friday, the leaders of the main Westminster political parties gave their reaction to Trump's comments. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said: "I spoke to parents of young men who have lost their lives. It is a disgrace to denigrate their memory like that. "There is too much careless talk from President Trump. He clearly doesn't know the history of what happened. We must not have these sorts of throwaway remarks." Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey criticised the US president's remarks and said: "Trump avoided military service five times. How dare he question their sacrifice." Trump received five deferments from a military draft during the Vietnam War - four for academic reasons and one for bone spurs, a calcium build-up in the heels. Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said: "Donald Trump is wrong. For 20 years our armed forces fought bravely alongside America's in Afghanistan." American political and military figures have also expressed their anger and frustration over Trump's Nato comments. Former national security adviser Herbert Raymond McMaster, who served as senior US officer in Afghanistan, said British forces were engaged in counter-insurgency operations every day. "I think it's insulting to those who were fighting alongside of us," McMaster told the BBC. "What I would like him to say is to make amends by affirming our gratitude for our allies who fought alongside us, and especially those who made the ultimate sacrifice in a war that I think was important, obviously, to the future of all humanity." During his second term in office, Trump has repeatedly criticised Nato, often accusing its member states of not spending enough on defence. In the last few weeks, Trump has made comments about acquiring Greenland - a semi-autonomous territory of fellow Nato ally Denmark. Trump's repeated remarks over ownership, threats of military action and tariffs against traditional European allies have rattled the transatlantic treaty. The White House has remained pretty quiet on the outrage being expressed in Britain - partly because the story has not played big in the US, and because Trump has been otherwise occupied, not making his usual appearances in front of cameras to have questions thrown at him. On Friday - before Starmer called on the US president to apologise - the White House released a statement sticking by Trump's long-held view on Nato. The White House said: "President Trump is right – America's contributions to Nato dwarf that of other countries, and his success in delivering a 5% spending pledge from Nato allies is helping Europe take greater responsibility for its own defense. "The United States is the only Nato partner who can protect Greenland, and the president is advancing Nato interests in doing so." The White House is yet to comment on Starmer's suggestion for an apology. Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to keep up with the inner workings of Westminster and beyond.

Frank Gardner: Not only Americans risked life and limb to serve in Afghanistan Blast walls, rocket attacks, Forward Operating Bases (FOBs), Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs)... and long queues in the canteen. Anyone who deployed to Afghanistan, in whatever role, between 2001-2021 will have their own vivid memories of that time. It started with the flight in – to Kandahar, Kabul or Camp Bastion. It could be a long, slow descent with the lights out on an RAF jet, or a rapid, corkscrew down in a C-130 transport plane. In both cases the aim was to avoid being blown out of the air by a Taliban surface-to-air missile. Over the course of 20 years thousands of servicemen and women, as well as civilians, from dozens of countries deployed to Afghanistan, answering the US call for assistance. That call came in the form of invoking Nato's Article 5 of its charter – the only time it has ever happened in Nato's 77-year history – which states that an attack on one member shall be deemed an attack on all. America was reeling from the devastating 9/11 attacks when al-Qaeda, which was being sheltered by the Taliban in Afghanistan, murdered nearly 3,000 people by flying packed airliners into New York's Twin Towers and the Pentagon in Washington. The Taliban were swiftly driven from power in a joint effort by the US military, the CIA and Afghanistan's Northern Alliance. Then it was all about trying to hunt down the remnants of al-Qaeda as Britain's Royal Marines, together with UK Special Forces, pursued them over the mountains but many escaped to safety to regroup in Pakistan. It was not until ten years later that the US Navy's Seal Team Six commandos tracked down the al-Qaeda leader, Osama Bin Laden, in a villa in Abbottabad, Pakistan. The first two years of the US-led "Operation Enduring Freedom" as it was called, were relatively quiet. By late 2003, as America's attention switched to Iraq, US servicemen we met even started referring to Afghanistan as "Op Forgotten". But it was still dangerous. From a rain-soaked Kandahar airbase we watched Romanian troops edge nervously out on patrol in their Soviet-era armoured vehicles, wary of the next ambush. Flying into a remote US-manned firebase in the mountainous Paktika province in a Blackhawk helicopter, my BBC crew and I were told cheerfully: "You've come to the worst place in the world". Sure enough, the Taliban launched Chinese-made rockets at the base after dark, planted there, we were told, by farmers who had been either bribed or coerced into doing so. Everything changed after 2006, when the UK deployed in force to Helmand province, a part of Afghanistan that had been relatively peaceful until then. The Taliban made their intentions clear. If you come, they said, then we will fight you. And yet the UK government at the time appeared shocked at the ferocity of the fighting 3 Para now found themselves engaged in, with British paratroopers calling in mortar and artillery fire so close to their positions it was termed "danger close", in an effort to stop their bases from being overrun. Over the next eight years, until the end of combat operations in 2014, it was not just Americans who were risking life and limb to serve in Afghanistan. Brits, Canadians, Danes and Estonians were among those who saw the toughest fighting in Kandahar and Helmand provinces. It would also be churlish to ignore the bravery and sacrifice of so many Afghans who fought and died over two decades. I say "fighting" but most soldiers' biggest fears stemmed from the hidden IEDs, those expertly concealed Improvised Explosive Devices. The Taliban, who of course knew every inch of their terrain, were often able to guess correctly exactly where troops would need to cross an irrigation ditch or canal and so place the bomb accordingly. In the space of a split second, in a blinding flash and puff of black smoke, a fit, healthy, 20-something individual would have their life either ended or catastrophically changed, facing amputation and a host of other complications. So prevalent were these IEDs that soldiers were going out of the gates of their FOBs - Forward Operating Bases - on patrol praying that if they got hit it would result in a below-the-knee amputation, not one above the knee. The courage and resilience of the people I have met since, who have managed, despite terrible loss and adversity, to turn their shattered lives around, is both humbling and awe-inspiring. These are just some of the people who answered America's call for help after the 9/11 attacks. It is little wonder there has been such nationwide outrage at that country's president's suggestion that they somehow dodged the fighting.

**Excerpt**

Spanish track was fractured before high-speed train disaster, report finds A fracture in a straight section of track "occurred prior to the passage" of a high-speed train that derailed, causing last Sunday's rail disaster in which 45 people died, an initial report has found. A train run by private company Iryo derailed last Sunday and its rear carriages crossed on to the opposite track into the path of an oncoming train run by state-owned Renfe. The CIAF rail investigation commission said not only did Iryo train's front carriages which stayed on the track have "notches" in their wheels, but three earlier trains that went over the track earlier did too. A gap of almost 40cm (15in) in the track has become the focus of the investigation into the crash. Sunday's deadly collision occurred at around 19:45 local time (18:45 GMT), about an hour after the Iryo train left Málaga for Madrid. The train's last three carriages - carriages six to eight - derailed and collided with the Huelva-bound Renfe train. "Carriage six derailed due to a complete lack of continuity in the track," the preliminary report finds. Most of those killed and injured were in the front carriages of the state-operated train. Earlier this week, Spanish Transport Minister Óscar Puente confirmed reports that grooves were found on the wheels of the Iryo train's carriages, which had passed over the track safely. "These notches in the wheels and the deformation observed in the track are compatible with the fact that the track was cracked," the CIAF preliminary report said. It added that three trains that had gone over the tracks at 17:21 on Sunday, 19:01 and then 19:09 had similar notches "with a compatible geometric pattern". Similar grooves are found on carriages two, three and four of the Iryo train, the report says, but carriage five - the last that did not derail - had a groove on its outer edge, suggesting the rail was already tilting outwards before carriage six derailed. The CIAF called its report a "working hypothesis", adding that it "must be corroborated by later detailed calculations and analysis". The transport minister appeared before reporters again on Friday to say that it was too early to have definitive answers, but that if the cause of the crash was the fracture, then it occurred in the minutes and hours before the derailment and could not have been detected. The Adamuz disaster is is the country's worst rail crash in more than a decade. In 2013, Spain suffered its worst high-speed train derailment in Galicia, north-west Spain, which left 80 people dead and 140 others injured.

'I saw people getting shot': Eyewitness tells of Iran protest crackdown Warning: This story contains details which some readers might find distressing. An Iranian woman who witnessed the bloody crackdown on protests in Iran has described how her neighbourhood turned into a "war zone" as security forces opened fire at crowds with live ammunition. A government-imposed internet blackout in Iran, now in its third week, has prevented many accounts of what has happened from reaching the wider world. But some Iranians who have left the country have been able to share what they have seen. Parnia, who lives in London, told the BBC that she was visiting her family in the central city of Isfahan when the protests broke out in the capital, Tehran. They quickly spread across the country, and within days there were hundreds of protesters in the Hakim Nezami and Khaghani neighbourhoods of Isfahan. "There were women and men from seven to 70 years old," she said. "On just one street there were 200 to 300 people. People were chanting 'Death to the dictator' and 'Long live the shah'." The "dictator" was Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and the shah a reference to Iran's late last monarch, overthrown in the 1979 Islamic revolution, and his son, the exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi. Isfahan has seen protests and crackdowns down the years. But Parnia said she had never seen anything like what happened during the recent unrest, which was sparked by anger over the collapse of the Iranian currency. First, security forces fired tear gas at the protesters, she said. Then they formed a line and fired birdshot. "I saw people getting shot and falling down, and I saw blood on the street." Parnia said she ran away down alleyways and was suddenly pulled into an apartment block by a woman. Inside, she said, were many injured protesters. "I saw the lobby floor covered in blood, and I saw a girl whose leg was full of pellets." Videos verified by the BBC from that night show large numbers of people in the streets in Isfahan. Some streets were blocked by traffic sign poles and large metal sheets, in an apparent effort by protesters to protect themselves from gunfire. Footage also showed protesters breaking through the gates of the building of the national broadcaster Irib, which was later set on fire. On Friday morning, 9 January, Khamenei said Iran would not back down from dealing with what he called "destructive elements", a day after US President Donald Trump had threatened to hit Iran "very hard" if authorities started killing people. Following Khamenei's speech, the powerful Revolutionary Guards sent a text message to people across Iran, telling them to avoid gatherings on streets in areas of unrest. The messages also warned against co-operating with what it described as "terrorist mercenaries" - an act it said would constitute treason. Despite the risks, Parnia went out to protest again on Friday evening. "The protesters were hopeful," she said. "You could see fear on everyone's faces. We were afraid to pass in front of the security forces and come closer together," she said. "We thought even if we get killed, it would be a reason for Trump to act faster." Footage obtained by the BBC from the previous day shows large crowds on main streets in Parnia's neighbourhood. But she said on the Friday it was different. "Protesters were in small groups gathered in alleyways. Every time that someone tried to gather in the larger street, we could hear live fire sound followed by screams and shouts." Because of the internet blackouts, and protesters avoiding taking their phones with them, the BBC has not yet obtained footage from Friday night. Parnia also described a scene of "total chaos" at a local clinic that was treating wounded protesters. "No phone lines were working. Nobody could call their families, and many refused to go to hospitals, fearing they could be arrested there," she said. "All the nurses could do was clean the wounds and send them home. The next day you could still smell the tear gasses in the air. Security forces were present and there were checkpoints across the city." Parnia left Isfahan that same day and travelled to the capital, Tehran, to catch a flight back to London. "I arrived in Tehran at 6pm. All the shops were closed and many people gathered in the streets. At 8pm everyone started to chant and I could hear gunshots," she said. "The airport was so busy. Many foreign airlines were cancelled and people were frustrated. Luckily, I found an Iranian flight to leave." Since her return to the UK, Parnia has been in touch with her friends in Isfahan. She said she learned from a source that doctors at Feiz eye hospital in Isfahan had carried out around 300 surgical procedures to remove the eyes of patients with birdshot-related facial injuries. "Every time you go out into the streets, you see random people with eye patches," Parnia's friends told her. According to several health workers who spoke to the BBC, hospitals are monitored and controlled by security forces, and people with gunshot wounds in Isfahan are being arrested. "Many of the injured are developing infections. Some doctors are referring them to surgeons who can treat them in private clinics," Parnia's cited her friends as saying. While Iranian authorities have said around 3,000 people were killed during the protests, US-based human rights group HRANA has so far confirmed more than 4,600 deaths, with another 9,700 cases still under review. According to the group, at least 7,300 people have also sustained serious injuries. Many believe the true figures may be even higher. Parnia said she was now preparing to join Iranian opposition protests in the UK, saying she wants to be a voice for the silenced protesters. She also expressed anger at international media reports suggesting that Iranians and the country's political opposition was not united. "Iranians have shown what they want in the streets and paid a high price for it."

Alleged drug kingpin and ex-Olympian Ryan Wedding arrested after years on the run Former Canadian Olympic snowboarder and alleged drug kingpin Ryan Wedding has been arrested in Mexico and will be extradited to the US after years on the run, FBI Director Kash Patel has said. Wedding, who had been on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list, is accused of running a transnational drug trafficking operation that moved tonnes of cocaine across international borders. Wedding, 44, was also wanted on murder charges. US officials had said they believed Wedding was living in Mexico under the Sinaloa drug cartel's protection. The head of Canada's federal police force, which assisted in the investigation, spoke alongside Patel on Friday to praise the law enforcement operation. "No single agency or nation can combat transnational organised crime alone," said Mike Duheme, Commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). "We can finally say that our communities, our countries, are much safer with the arrest of Ryan Wedding," he added. Wedding is expected to make his first court appearance in Los Angeles on Monday. Wedding is accused of running a vast drug trafficking operation responsible for importing some 60 metric tonnes of cocaine a year. The organisation operated across North America, as well as several countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, and was also the largest supplier of cocaine to Canada, bringing in an estimated $1bn a year. Before he was arrested, Wedding was accused of killing a federal witness in a case against him. Officials say he has also ordered the murders of several others. Wedding is now facing a slew of felony charges, including witness tampering and intimidation, murder, money laundering and drug trafficking. The FBI had previously placed a $15m (£11m) reward for information leading to his arrest. Patel declined to comment on whether anyone would be claiming the reward money. US officials have released limited details regarding how Wedding was captured, except to say that his arrest took place on Thursday night in Mexico City. Mexico's top security official, Omar García Harfuch, said in a post on X that Patel had visited Mexico City on Thursday, and departed with two fugitives on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list. He did not name the men arrested, but said one was a "Canadian citizen who voluntarily surrendered" at the US embassy in Mexico. The Associated Press, citing an unnamed Mexican Security Cabinet member, reported that Wedding is the Canadian who turned himself in at the US embassy. In his remarks at a news conference, Patel described Wedding as a "modern-day Pablo Escobar", referring to the Colombian cartel leader. US officials have also compared him to Mexican drug dealer Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán. "When you go after a guy like Ryan Wedding, it takes a united front," Patel said, thanking Canadian and Mexican authorities for their help in the investigation. Patel also thanked the FBI Hostage Rescue Team, who participated in taking Wedding into custody. In an interview with Vanity Fair, Patel praised the team, which had also been involved in the capture of Venezuelan President Nicholas Maduro weeks earlier. "This was a complex, high-stakes operation with zero margin for error," Patel told the magazine. "I was on the ground with our team in Mexico and witnessed extraordinary teamwork, precision, and trust between our agents and partners in Mexico." Wedding's aliases include "El Jefe," "Giant," "Public Enemy," "James Conrad King," and "Jesse King", the FBI said. He has reportedly had plastic surgery to change his appearance while on the run. Officials allege that he launched his criminal enterprise following his release from a US federal prison in 2011, where he was serving a sentence for cocaine distribution. Authorities allege he has ordered dozens of murders across the globe, including in the US, Canada and Latin America. Officials say he had been living in luxury in Mexico. In December, Mexican authorities announced that they had seized $40m in racing motorcycles owned by Wedding. They also seized other valuable items, including luxury paintings, artworks, drugs and two Olympic gold medals. It is unclear to whom the medals belong. Wedding competed for Canada in the 2002 Olympic Games in Salt Lake City, but did not win any medals. He came in 24th place in the men's giant parallel slalom ski event. In November, the FBI seized his rare 2002 Mercedes CLK-GTR, which had been valued at $13m. Patel also spoke about the recent arrest of another man in Mexico who had been on the FBI's most wanted list. American man Alejandro Castillo was wanted for the murder of his ex-girlfriend. According to the FBI, he has been in hiding in Mexico for nearly 10 years, and will now be extradited back to North Carolina for trial.

Danish PM in Greenland for 'show of support' after Trump threats Danish PM Mette Frederiksen is visiting Greenland's capital Nuuk for talks with the territory's leader, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, after a rollercoaster week that saw US President Donald Trump roll back his threats to forcibly take over the Arctic island and agree to further negotiations. Tensions had risen precariously over the past couple of weeks, until a stunning turnaround on Wednesday, when Trump suddenly ruled out military action, and withdrew his threats to slap tariffs on several European allies. Trump posted on social media that a "framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland" had been reached, following his meeting with Nato chief Mark Rutte at the World Economic Forum in Davos. However, few details have been given, and there are questions about what exactly was agreed between the US president and the secretary general. The Danish prime minister travelled directly from Brussels, where she also met face-to-face with Rutte earlier on Friday morning. According to Rutte's post on X, they agreed "to enhance deterrence and defence in the Arctic". After landing at Nuuk airport, Frederiksen was greeted on the tarmac by Nielsen, who gave her a hug. "I am first and foremost in Greenland today to show our strong Danish support for the Greenlandic people," she told reporters. "It's a very difficult time, everyone can see that." "It is a serious situation we are in. Everyone can see that. Now there is a diplomatic, political track that we will pursue," she said. Her trip was a "working" visit to prepare their "next steps," she said. On Thursday, Trump told Fox News that the US "gets everything we want at no cost" and that a "piece" of his planned "Golden Dome" missile defence system would be placed on Greenland. When asked if this was an actual "acquisition", he answered: "It's total access. There's no end, there's no time limit." Previously the New York Times reported that one idea under discussion was Denmark ceding sovereignty over small pockets of land where the US would build military bases. Danish and Greenlandic officials have pushed back strongly against giving up any form of ownership, and repeatedly stated that sovereignty is a "red line". Ahead of an emergency European summit in the Belgian capital on Thursday evening, Frederiksen said that Greenland's sovereignty was non-negotiable, though Denmark was willing to work on "security". The US has around 150 military personnel at its single Pituffik base in the north-western tip of the territory. Under a defence pact with Denmark, dating back to 1951, the US can already build up its military presence and deploy further troops. That was updated in 2004, jointly with the Bush administration, to include Greenland as an equal partner to the deal. AFP has reported that sources familiar with talks had said the US and Denmark would renegotiate the 1951 agreement. Danish national newspaper Berlingske also writes that a renegotiation is possible, that the Danish and Greenlandic sides have not ruled out revising that deal. However, mineral rights or the surrender of territory have never been on the table. The BBC has reached out to Denmark's Ministry of Defence, which declined to comment. Meanwhile Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said on Friday there had been no detailed plan, but that negotiations would start soon, focusing on "security, security, and security".

Somaliland president pitches business opportunities to Trump's son The president of Somaliland has held separate talks with his Israeli counterpart and the second son of the US leader, as the breakaway region continues to seek international recognition and foreign investment. Somaliland President Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi met Isaac Herzog and businessman Eric Trump at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. ''Our discussions focused on strengthening and advancing bilateral relations between the Republic of Somaliland and the State of Israel,'' Abdullahi said in a post on X about the meeting with Herzog. Last month, Israel became the first country to recognise Somaliland - 35 years after it declared independence from Somalia. President "Cirro", as he is known in Somaliland, shared images on social media of the closed-door event, which was reportedly organised by the Greek House Davos programme, a private forum for discreet high-level gatherings. Abdirahman Bayle, an advisor to Somaliland's leader, told the BBC that Eric Trump had ''expressed interest in Somaliland and the opportunities it offers''. ''Among the issues we discussed were global investors in the livestock and agriculture sectors, so that we can industrialise these sectors and export to the rest of the world," Bayle added. Livestock is the territory's main export, primarily to Saudi Arabia. Eric Trump does not have any official US government position but holds a senior role at the Trump Organization, which runs the family's businesses. The BBC has approached his representatives for comment but has not received a response. Somaliland sits in a strategic position on major Red Sea and Gulf of Aden shipping routes. During the talks, the president emphasised Somaliland's openness to investment, pointing to the deep-water port of Berbera as a potential logistics hub for trade and energy infrastructure. Bayle told the BBC that his government's approach had shifted. "For the first time, we are not asking the world for aid," he said. "We are offering our resources." Israel's president described the talks as positive, posting on X: "I was pleased to meet here in Davos with the President of Somaliland. "I welcome the establishment of diplomatic relations between us and look forward to deepening cooperation for the benefit of our two peoples." Earlier this month, Israel's Foreign Minister Gideon Saar visited Somaliland for the first time and said Israel was determined to advance relations with Somaliland "with momentum". Somaliland has governed itself since it broke away from Somalia in 1991 after the collapse of the central government in Mogadishu. It has held its own elections, issued its own currency and built its own security forces, maintaining relative stability compared with much of southern Somalia. However, its declaration of independence had not been recognised internationally until Israel's move in December. The recognition drew criticism from Somalia, the African Union and countries including China and Turkey, which said it violated Somalia's territorial integrity. The US defended Israel, accusing its critics of double standards. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

Luxury watchmaker designs $1.5m model with Indian billionaire's statue A new luxury watch themed on a private zoo run by the family of Asia's richest man Mukesh Ambani has been unveiled in India - complete with a hand-painted figurine of the tycoon's youngest son, Anant, in the centre. Designed by luxury watchmaker Jacob & Co, the bejewelled timepiece has sculpted figures of a lion and a Bengal tiger placed around Anant's statue seated on a chair. While the watchmaker has not disclosed the price, industry collective Watchopea estimates its value at $1.5m (£1.1m, 137m rupees). The centre - branded as a private wildlife rescue and rehabilitation centre - is home to more than 2,000 species, including lions, elephants and tigers, and is spread over 3,500 acres. The zoo, which is owned by Anant and is not open to the public, hit the headlines last year after allegations of unlawfully acquiring and mistreating animals, but a Supreme Court-appointed team later found no evidence of wrongdoing. It is located in Jamnagar in the western state of Gujarat, not far from Mukesh Ambani's oil refinery - which is the largest in the world. Vantara was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in March last year. It was also one of the venues for Anant Ambani's lavish 2024 pre-wedding events that made global headlines. The wedding and other events were attended by all of India's top Bollywood stars and global celebrities such as Kim Kardashian and Rihanna. Private zoo run by billionaire Ambani family cleared of 'foul play' - The marathon Indian wedding turning heads around the world - Meet the tycoons behind the grand Indian wedding - Also in attendance were business leaders such as Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg, former British prime ministers Tony Blair and Boris Johnson, and US president's daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner. In their social media post unveiling the watch, Jacob & Co said their new luxury timepiece was "a tribute to Vantara" and Anant's figurine at the centre of the dial "symbolised stewardship and responsibility". It said the watch was made up of 397 precious stones, including diamonds, green sapphires, garnets and other gems. An executive associated with the brand's India retail partner Ethos Watches told the BBC that the company has not disclosed the price of the watch. He also said that it is not available in the stores yet.

**Excerpt**

Spanish prosecutors dismiss Julio Iglesias sex assault allegations Spanish prosecutors have dropped an investigation into complaints of sexual abuse against the singer Julio Iglesias. They ruled that Spanish courts had no jurisdiction and were therefore not competent to investigate crimes committed abroad involving complainants who were not Spanish citizens or residents and who had never travelled to Spain with the star. Two female former employees had alleged that the 82-year-old Spanish superstar "normalised abuse" in a coercive, threatening and violent environment while they were working at his properties in the Bahamas and Dominican Republic in 2021. Iglesias has vigorously denied the allegations, which were first reported last week. On 5 January, the women filed a legal complaint for sexual assault and human trafficking with the national court, which investigates crimes allegedly committed beyond Spain's borders. Advocacy groups Women's Link Worldwide and Amnesty International said the acts alleged in the complaint could be considered "a crime of human trafficking for the purpose of forced labour" and "crimes against sexual freedom". Women's Link Worldwide described the complainants as young Latin American women "in vulnerable situations who were heavily dependent on their wages due to their economic and social conditions". It said the complaint was submitted in Spain because the country has legislation to protect women from gender-based violence and trafficking. But prosecutors said the fact that the complainants were not Spanish citizens or residents meant that the legal principle of universal jurisdiction could not be applied. They also argued that the states where the alleged crimes took place - the Dominican Republic and the Bahamas - had "clear and effective competence" to investigate the allegations themselves. Iglesias has responded to the accusations with a post on Instagram (in Spanish), in which he said: "I deny having abused, coerced, or disrespected any woman. These accusations are absolutely false and deeply sadden me." Several friends of the singer have also fiercely denied that he could be capable of such behaviour. Iglesias is one of the most successful Latin artists of all time, having sold more than 300 million records in a career spanning decades. He is also the father of fellow music superstar Enrique Iglesias.

Canadian woman found dead on Australian beach likely died of drowning, autopsy finds A Canadian backpacker, who was found dead on an Australian beach and surrounded by a pack of dingoes earlier this week, likely died of drowning, an autopsy has found. Piper James, 19, had "physical evidence consistent with drowning" and "injuries consistent with dingo bites", a spokesperson for the Coroners Court of Queensland told BBC news. "Pre-mortem dingo bite marks" were unlikely to have caused her "immediate death", the spokesperson added. The autopsy was part of a preliminary assessment, and establishing her exact cause of death could take several weeks. Piper's body was found on a beach on K'Gari, an island off the eastern state of Queensland on Monday. In a statement to the BBC, the coroner also said there were "extensive post-mortem dingo bite marks" and that no evidence anyone else was involved. Piper's father, Todd James told Australia's 9News that the family felt relieved, as the autopsy results meant her body could be released back to her family in Canada. Her mother Angela told Global News that her daughter had always dreamed of travelling and had saved money for this trip after she graduated high school. Both parents had concerns about her travelling at her age, but Piper was determined. The teenager had been working at a backpacker's hostel for the past six weeks, and told friends she was going for a 05:00 morning swim on Monday, Australian media reported. Her body was found around 06:30 local time (20:30 GMT on Sunday). She was found near the Maheno shipwreck, which was washed ashore in 1935 and is now a popular tourist landmark. The area is known for its population of dingoes, a wild species of native dog that is protected in Queensland national parks. About 200 dingoes live on World Heritage-listed K'Gari, according to the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service.

Taliban release female athlete, 22, after 13 days in jail A 22-year-old Afghan woman who was reportedly running a taekwondo gym for girls has been released after spending 13 days in jail, a spokesman for the Taliban's supreme court confirmed. Khadija Ahmadzada was detained for being in "violation" of rules "regarding women's sports gyms", a spokesman for the Taliban's ministry of vice and virtue told the BBC. Sports clubs have been closed to women since 2021, shortly after the Taliban returned to power. At the time, it was said they would reopen once a "safe environment" - which does not contravene the Taliban's strict interpretation of Islamic law - had been established. As of January 2026, no sports club has reopened, while women are still unable to compete. It is one of a raft of measures that have been imposed on women by the Taliban since 2021, which have seen their rights to education and work curtailed as well as strict rules around clothing imposed. Ahmadzada, who lives near the western city of Herat, was detained with a number of other people after "violations were observed" by vice and virtue inspectors, the ministry spokesman said. She was accused of not wearing "a proper hijab", "playing music" and allowing genders to mix in her gym and sentenced to 13 days in jail. The spokesman said she had been given multiple warnings. The case was then referred to the supreme court, which announced she would be released on Thursday 22 January. It is unclear where she is now. News of Ahmadzada's arrest led to an outcry on social media, attracting the attention of Richard Bennett, the United Nations' special rapporteur on human rights in Afghanistan, who posted online calling for her immediate release. He also highlighted the case of female journalist Nazira Rashidi, in the northern city of Kunduz, who was detained in late December. Taliban spokesmen deny her detention is related to her work as a journalist, according to local media.

Pakistan mall fire death toll jumps to 67 The death toll in a fire which engulfed a shopping centre in Pakistan has climbed to 67, police have confirmed. Police say 77 people are currently reported as missing by their families following the fire at Gul Plaza, in Pakistan's largest city Karachi, on Saturday evening. But the scale of the damage following the blaze - which took more than 24 hours to put out - has slowed rescue efforts, as authorities comb the remains of the 6,500sq m (70,000 sq ft) complex. While some of the bodies found are only partial remains, authorities had been able to count 67 skulls, the deputy commissioner of police told the BBC. The process to identify the bodies continues, with 15 people identified so far. Gul Plaza had housed some 1,200 shops, spread across multiple floors. It is wedding season in Karachi, often a particularly busy time of year for shoppers. While the cause of the fire is still unknown, witnesses earlier told the BBC that a lack of working fire exits and the density of shoppers and stalls crammed into the building exacerbated the disaster. Shop owner Rehan Faisal recounted how it only took about "five to seven minutes" for everything to "burn before our eyes". "Many customers and shopkeepers were coming up... and saying there was a fire downstairs. I was just beginning to comprehend the situation when the shop owner told me to lock up and get out," he told BBC Urdu. With the facility due to close soon, most of the gates of the shopping centre were locked, witnesses said. Senior police official Syed Asad Raza told Reuters news agency that all but three of the centre's 16 exits were locked.

**Excerpt**

'Blood was all over' - victim of Nigeria church abduction describes escape There was a huge plaster on Sarah Peter's head to staunch the bleeding caused by the blow of a gunman's weapon. Sarah, not her real name, was in church in a village in northern Nigeria on Sunday morning when attackers raided the compound to abduct the worshippers and take them away on foot. The 60-year-old was whacked on the skull with a rifle to encourage her to move. "Blood was all over," she said, her fingers brushing the area where the wound was. "I suffered," she added, clearly still traumatised by what happened three days earlier. "They kept dragging me even when I told them I couldn't walk. Then I hid somewhere until I couldn't see them any more. I was so weak I had to crawl back to the village." Dozens of others were taken away from her branch of the Cherubim and Seraphim Movement Church and two other churches in Kurmin Wali, a village 135km (84 miles) north of the capital, Abuja. Although 11 people managed to escape, including Sarah, more than 160 people are still unaccounted for, according to the local branch of the Christian Association of Nigeria. The remaining villagers have been left devastated and fear more attacks. Authorities have not released any figures for those missing. Kurmin Wali is near Kaduna state's Rijana forest, a hideout for armed gangs, known here as "bandits", who have been carrying out raids and abductions in the region. No group has said it was behind Sunday's raid, but the attack is part of a wider security crisis in Nigeria, with kidnapping for ransom becoming more common. Paying kidnappers is illegal in Nigeria but it is often suspected that money has been handed over to free those who have been abducted. In this case, no ransom demand has been reported. There has been an increasing international focus on the issue after US President Donald Trump alleged last year that Christians were being targeted and killed in record numbers. Last month, the US military carried out air strikes on camps of suspected Islamist militants in Nigeria's north-west. Nigerian officials have denied that Christians were being singled out because of their faith, and have said Muslims, Christians and those with no religion have all been affected by the insecurity. There is an air of tension and anger in Kurmin Wali. The village head said people had been living in fear for a while. Local residents have been urging authorities to improve security and have accused them of trying to suppress information in the wake of Sunday's raid. Forty-eight hours of confusion followed the attack as officials initially denied anything had happened, despite eyewitness reports, only to finally confirm events on Tuesday evening. "They told us not to give out any information, they want to intimidate us but we must tell our story. They have also been stopping some journalists from coming to the town," said a young man in his 20s, who wished to remain anonymous. It is not clear why the authorities may have been reluctant for news to get out, but Kaduna state governor Uba Sani told the BBC that officials wanted to confirm details first before making any statements. However, that does not explain why the local police chief and a state official initially denied there had been any attack, describing the reports as a "mere falsehood which is being peddled by conflict entrepreneurs who want to cause chaos". The BBC also faced difficulties reaching Kurmin Wali, after a politician and security personnel attempted to block access to the village. But we managed to get through and once inside, we found a scene of chaos in the building of the Cherubim and Seraphim Movement Church. Colourful plastic chairs were on their sides, prayer books scattered on the floor and musical instruments broken, as if the moment after the attack had been frozen in time. Nearby, Christopher Yohanna was looking forlornly at his two-year-old daughter. He said he managed to escape from the attackers with his child. "We were in the church when we heard shouting. When we came out and tried to run, we saw that gunmen had already surrounded the village." He was lucky not to be caught, but he is devastated because his two wives and other children were not so lucky. "If my family is not with me then my life is worthless and free of any joy," he said. Governor Sani was in Kurmin Wali three days after the attack, pledging to establish a military base, a hospital and a road in the area. He also announced relief measures for affected residents, including medical support. "We cannot relocate them because they have to farm… but to ensure that we protect them going forward, we need to have a military base around that area between that village and Rijana forest," he told the BBC. He also said efforts were under way to work with security agencies to rescue those still in captivity. "When we met [the villagers] I affirmed that we are with them and… we will not let any of them down." As the residents of Kurmin Wali wait anxiously for the return of their family members, they are hoping the governor keeps to his word. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

**Excerpt**

Could Trump's new Board of Peace sideline the struggling UN? "Together we are in a position to… end decades of suffering, stop generations of hatred and bloodshed, and forge a beautiful, everlasting and glorious peace for that region and for the whole region of the world." Such was the soaring promise of US President Donald Trump as he inaugurated his new Board of Peace on the stage of stages that is the Davos Economic Forum this week. The world of all too much suffering and strife badly wants to believe him. But for many observers and officials in capitals the world over, it is yet more proof of Trump's drive to dismantle the post-war international architecture and replace it with new institutions - dominated by him. "We will not let anyone play us," Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk warned tersely on social media. But from Trump's biggest backer in Europe, Viktor Orban, came effusive praise: "If Trump, then peace." What exactly will this Board, headed in perpetuity by Trump himself, do? Could this really be a bid to build a UN mini-me? Power of the Board chairman The idea - born last year in US-led efforts to end the war in Gaza and endorsed by a UN Security Council resolution - now has a much greater, far grander, more global ambition. And it pivots around the president. In leaked details of the draft charter he is the Board's chairman for life even when he leaves office. Under that charter his powers would be vast: authority to invite member states or not; to create or dissolve subsidiary bodies; and the mandate to appoint his successor whenever he decides to step down, or if he is incapacitated. If any other country would like to become a permanent member, the price is an eye-watering $1 billion (£740m). This latest bombshell lands in what is already a head-spinning month. In a few short weeks there's already been the US capture of Venezuela's leader, Trump threats and preparations for military action against Iran, and demands to acquire Greenland which sent shock waves across Europe and beyond. Nineteen countries showed up in Davos for the Board's inauguration from all corners of the compass - from Argentina to Azerbaijan, from former Soviet republics to Gulf kingdoms. Many more are said to have "agreed to join". "In this group, I like every single one of them," Trump grinned as he eyed leaders and officials whose names are now on this Board or the layers of executive bodies beneath it. Many more potential members have so far politely demurred. "This is about a treaty that raises much broader issues, and we do also have concerns about President Putin being part of something that is talking about peace" explained the UK's Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper. Trump says Russia is on board although the message from Moscow was that they were still "consulting partners". "As the text stands right now," we're not joining, replied Sweden. "The proposal raises unanswered questions that require further dialogue with Washington" was Norway's diplomatic response. Even a group of seven predominantly Muslim countries, including six Arab nations, as well as Turkey and Indonesia, made it clear they were in it for a "just and lasting peace in Gaza," including the reconstruction of the shattered enclave. However leaked details of the Board's charter don't mention Gaza. For some of the critics, including some countries reluctant to join, it's a vainglorious project for a president who doesn't hide his fixation with winning the biggest accolade – the Nobel Peace Prize, which was won by President Obama in 2009 at the start of his first term in the White House. World leaders know there may be a price to pay for not joining this new club. "I'll put a 200% tariff on his wines and champagnes, and he'll join, but he doesn't have to join." This was the president's rebuke to France's President Emmanuel Macron with a threat to wield his weapon of choice. Only Slovenia said the quiet part out loud. Prime Minister Robert Golob made his concern clear – it "dangerously interferes with the broader international order". Trump addressed this concern head-on. "Once this Board is completely formed, we can do pretty much whatever we want to do and we'll do it in conjunction with the United Nations," he explained to the packed hall hanging on his every word. But he likes to keep the world guessing. A day earlier, when asked by a Fox TV journalist whether his Board would replace the UN, he replied "Well it might. The UN just hasn't been very helpful." Then he added "I'm a big fan of the UN potential, but it has never lived up to its potential. The UN should have settled every one of the wars that I settled." A new contender for peacemaker-in-chief? The UN, 193 members strong, has indeed long lost its role as peacemaker-in-chief. When I interviewed the Secretary General António Guterres in October 2016, on his first day in his first term, just hours after a rare unanimous endorsement by the Security Council, he promised "a surge in diplomacy for peace". For the past decade, the UN's efforts were thwarted by the gridlocked Security Council, the growing number of spoilers and state sponsors in wars the world over, as well as the steady erosion in its own standing vis-a-vis the world's most powerful players, including the United States. "We must all welcome the activism of Mr Trump on ending wars," says Martin Griffiths, a UN veteran who believes this new effort is "obviously a reflection of the failure of the UN Security Council and of the UN writ large." But the former Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator cautioned that "what we've learned over these last 80 years, through lots and lots of failures and clunkiness, we learned the value of inclusion, of being representative of the global community, not just the friends of Mr Trump." Guterres himself recently regretted that "there are those that believe the power of law should be replaced by the law of power". Asked in an interview with the BBC's Today programme about Trump's constant claim that he's ended eight wars, he replied matter-of-factly "they are ceasefires." Some have already broken down. The temporary peace deal between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo soon fell apart, Cambodia and Thailand started hurling accusations and more across their border, and India disputed Trump's central role in ending its conflagration with Pakistan. But only Trump's muscular mediation could have ended the 12-day war between Iran and Israel. His own personal involvement finally secured a ceasefire in Gaza's destructive confrontation last October which eased both the suffering of Palestinians, and the agony of Israeli hostages. His decision to finally and fully focus on this disaster, partly in response to urging from his closest Arab allies and grieving Israeli families, pushed him to pressure Israel's Prime Minister Netanyahu and Hamas, to do a deal. But even the Board's first test – to move from the first phase of the deal to end the Gaza war – is daunting. Even now, as this new Board slowly takes shape, it includes Netanyahu who has vowed to stop the establishment of a Palestinian state, and Arab leaders who insist the only pathway to a sustainable peace must lead to Palestinian self-governance and the end of Israeli occupation. And the other big war on America's - and Europe's agenda - is Ukraine. President Zelensky has balked at being at the same table as Moscow and Minsk. Three layers lie beneath this Board, most focusing on Gaza – an Executive Board, a Gaza Executive Board, and the National Committee for the Administration for Gaza. They bring together a mix of senior American officials and billionaires, as well as respected former politicians and ex-UN envoys who know Gaza well, along with Arab ministers and intelligence chiefs, and Palestinian technocrats. Even some critics credit the president with putting an age-old battle of a different kind on the table – the incessant demand to reform the UN's post-war architecture including a Security Council which no longer aligns with the world's political map of major powers in every region. It's simply not fit for purpose. "Maybe an unintended good consequence of what Trump has done is those issues will be pushed back towards the top of the international agenda," reflected Mark Malloch Brown, the former UN deputy secretary-general. "We're coming out of a period of extremely weak UN leadership and I think this could be a call to action." Ironically, Trump's bid to lead the world towards peace comes as discussions gather steam in many capitals to replace Guterres who completes his second term at the end of this year. The president, who previously declared that he could end the Ukraine war in a day, has learned in his last year in power that peacemaking is a protracted and perilous process. But today he hailed a Middle East region where only "little fires" were burning now. He promised that a settlement in Ukraine "is coming very soon". And he revelled in his new role as would-be peacemaker-in-chief. "This is for the world" he exclaimed.

**Excerpt**

Vietnam's leader returns to power with bold promises. Can he deliver? Welcome to the new era of "national rise"! That was the pitch made by Vietnam's most powerful figure, Communist Party General Secretary To Lam, as he faced the nearly 1,600 delegates at the party congress, which gathered this week to determine the country's path for the next five years, and who leads it. On Friday it picked To Lam Vietnam to be party chief, the post he currently holds, for the next five years, giving him another term to achieve his ambitious targets for Vietnam's economy. The party congress, which was scheduled to end on Sunday, was cut short to Friday, signalling either a strong consensus or stifled opposition to To Lam's growing powers. Communist Party congresses are strictly choreographed, and most of the leadership positions in the Politburo and the larger Central Committee are worked out behind closed doors well in advance. To Lam's re-appointment to the top job was widely expected, but what remains to be seen is how this plays out in the congress, whose balance reflects the long-standing rivalry between To Lam's public security faction and the military. What makes the congress this year "unusual" is that "this is the strongest concentration of power in one individual that I've seen since 1991", Edmund Malesky, a professor of political economy at Duke University, told the BBC. Dramatic change of direction To Lam took over 18 months ago on the death of his predecessor Nguyen Phu Trong, an old-style communist ideologue who had presided over a sweeping and disruptive anti-corruption drive. As head of Vietnam's main security agency, the Ministry of Public Security, To Lam had led the purge of officials tainted by corruption allegations, but after he got the top job he announced a dramatic change of direction. The new focus was on reform, and growth, and To Lam's plans were the boldest the country had seen for 40 years. First, he announced a complete overhaul of Vietnam's administration, slashing layers of bureaucracy, cutting the number of provinces from 63 to 34, and laying off at least 100,000 government employees. Then came Resolution 68, passed on 4 May last year at a meeting of the politburo, the highest decision-making body between party congresses. In another country, its statement that the private sector will be "the most important driving force of the national economy" would be unremarkable. It was a barely noticeable change from the government's previous stance that it was "one important driving force". But in officially socialist Vietnam it marked a sea change, for the first time putting privately-owned businesses on the same level as state-run companies, which in the past had always been extolled as the bedrock of the economy. The meeting in May also announced breathtakingly ambitious targets for the economy: double digit annual growth, doubling the number of private businesses by 2030, and by 2045, the centenary of Vietnam's declaration of independence from French colonial rule, to have created an upper-income, knowledge- and technology-based economy. In other words, to break out of the so-called "middle income trap". No other large South East Asian country has managed to do this. Leading 'cranes' A central part of his strategy is to back national champions in the private sector – "leading cranes" in the party's words – companies big enough to compete on the global stage. In the last Fortune 500 list of top companies in South East Asia 11 of the 100 largest were Vietnamese, and of those only four were privately-owned. Most private companies are very small; only 2% employ more than 200 people. To Lam's goal is to have 20 globally competitive private companies by 2030, somewhat like the South Korean model in the 1970s of state-supported conglomerates known as chaebol, which led to the creation of global giants like Hyundai and Samsung. Vietnam's astonishing economic progress over the past 30 years has won it admiration around the world. Its record in poverty reduction is formidable. It turned an isolated, state-run economy which could barely feed its people into one of the world's manufacturing powerhouses. Yet behind these impressive achievements are some big limitations. One is the size of the state-owned sector. Even today, after all this frenetic change and growth, as of 2024, there are 671 state-owned enterprises accounting for 29% of Vietnam's GDP. Their advantages, getting preferential access to licences, government funding and resources like land make it difficult for private companies to compete and thrive. Even after Resolution 68 appeared to put them in second place, a new Resolution, number 79, was passed earlier this month, presumably after pushback by conservatives inside the party. This stated that state-owned enterprises could also be "leading cranes", and proposed a target of 50 from Vietnam, double the current number, reaching the Fortune 500 list for the region by 2030. Another is the dependence of many Vietnamese industries on foreign investment, foreign technology and overseas markets. Vietnam has become an efficient, low-cost manufacturer of other countries' products. To Lam himself spoke of this in January last year: "What percentage of the value do we contribute here? Or are we at the lowest end of the value chain, mainly doing outsourcing for foreign companies? If a shirt is sold with the design, fabric, dye, thread and buttons all sourced from someone else, what do we get? Perhaps only labour costs and environmental pollution." In fact the largest manufacturing company there is South Korean, Samsung, and it relies heavily on imported components and technology to make its phones and other electronic goods. This is the challenge faced by most South East Asian countries. Like Vietnam, they saw their economies grow at breakneck speeds as they joined an increasingly complex global supply chain from the 1980s onwards. Poverty fell as people moved to the cities to take up low-end manufacturing jobs. Yet today countries like Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia are stuck, seemingly unable to move up the value chain and break out of economies dependent on natural resources and manufacturing components for foreign products. Growth is stagnating, and in Thailand the population is aging quickly. Their largest home-grown companies are in banking, property, energy, telecoms and food. There is no Thai, Malaysian or Indonesian tech giant on the horizon. Could Vietnam be different? It does have one impressive tech company, FPT, which is now winning contracts with clients like Airbus and several large car manufacturers to help manage and upgrade software. It is reporting revenue of more than $1bn a year, employs 80,000 people across 30 countries and has even built its own university to ensure it has enough graduates with coding and English-language skills to call on. FPT is one of the "leading cranes" To Lam is hoping will take Vietnam out of the middle income trap. Yet FPT is dwarfed by the biggest of the "leading cranes", Vingroup, Vietnam's largest private company, which is much more like the traditional, family-owned conglomerates that dominate the economies of other South East Asian countries. Vingroup is massive. There are Vin homes, Vin hospitals, Vin schools and universities, Vin resorts and amusement parks, Vin solar farms. Vingroup builds expressways, and was the main bidder to build a new high-speed 1,500km (930-mile) railway from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City, until it pulled out last month. Then there is Vinfast, the company taking on China to build world-beating electric cars. So far its attempts to break into the US and European markets have been a flop, with its models dismissed as inferior to their competitors. Vinfast is thought to have lost as much as $11bn since 2021, but Vingroup is so big, its founder Pham Nhat Vuong so rich, it is willing to keep subsidising its EV experiment. Vinfast does well at home, thanks to political support from the Communist Party, like the recent ban on all combustion-engined motorbikes in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City - Vinfast is the dominant player in electric two-wheelers. Vingroup will be the biggest of the national champions under To Lam's grand project. But it has so far done well only in its home market, where its political connections have given it significant advantages. As it has discovered with its cars, succeeding as a global player is much harder. "The main challenge remains unchanged: how to create globally competitive firms without spawning politically-connected rent-seekers", says Nguyen Khac Giang at the ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore. " "To Lam's approach risks replacing one form of rent-seeking with another. If poorly executed, Vietnam could transition from inefficient state-owned enterprises extracting resources through monopoly positions, to private conglomerates doing the same through political connections. This would crowd out the small-medium enterprises that generate the most employment and innovation." No-one doubts the extraordinary drive and industriousness of the Vietnamese people, nor To Lam's determination to break out of the middle income trap. Without urgent reform we should expect failure, he said in June last year. Yet he is embarking on this journey at an especially difficult time. No other South East Asian country is as reliant as Vietnam on access to the US market, which is now uncertain after President Donald Trump's tariffs. Vietnam's famous "bamboo diplomacy", attempting to be friends to all, enemies to none, will also be sorely tested in the fraught international relations of the Trump II era.

**Excerpt**

Is the US-TikTok deal a new reality for China's tech champions? One in seven people in the world use TikTok. Yet for the company behind such a cultural phenomenon, the last few years have been a rollercoaster. Concerns over the app first surfaced more than five years ago, prompting President Trump, in his first term, to sign an executive order aimed at removing TikTok from US stores. Lawmakers were worried that the Chinese government could access user data of the 200 million Americans who use the app and possibly manipulate their feeds. To address these concerns, TikTok's parent company ByteDance launched Project Texas – storing US user data on domestic servers run by American-owned Oracle. The company also moved its headquarters to Singapore and Los Angeles – in part to distance itself from its Chinese roots. These were seen as significant concessions at the time. But still, in 2024 Congress passed a law threatening to ban the app outright, unless ByteDance transferred majority ownership and changed how TikTok operates in the US. That deal has now closed with ByteDance signing an agreement to split the US app from the rest of its global business under a new consortium of companies that includes Oracle. TikTok remains alive in a critical market, but the terms underline the compromises and limits that ByteDance - and perhaps other Chinese tech firms - may face as they try to expand globally. How did we get here? The US-China rivalry has seen Washington and Beijing crack down on each other's firms over national security concerns. Yet in the the most recent trade war TikTok became "low hanging fruit" that China could offer in exchange for other important concessions, like American agricultural products. The deal allows China to frame the outcome as a win - exporting tech on its own terms while gaining leverage in broader trade negotiations. ByteDance will retain access to America's 200 million users and 7.5 million businesses, but it loses control over TikTok's algorithm and data. Instead, the company will licence the algorithm to the new US entity, in a deal the Trump administration has valued at $14bn (£10bn). "TikTok's power lies in its content graph - an algorithm that learns from thousands of user signals to deliver hyper‑relevant, highly addictive videos," said Kelsey Chickering, principal analyst at Forrester. "With a US joint venture retraining that algorithm on domestic data, the experience will change... One thing's certain: TikTok in America won't be the same." This shift could have knock on effects for advertisers and creators because of the changes. Creators may see their engagement shrink especially because global virality will take a hit – previously content that took off in one region could become popular in the US organically. A US-only algorithm could weaken that, forcing brands to re-structure deals and perhaps having to pay more for US exposure. TikTok's global revenue was estimated to be $20-26bn in 2024, roughly $10 billion of which came from the US with advertising accounting for a large share. The changes will likely hurt TikTok's bottom line in the US, but ByteDance retains a 19.9% stake and therefore a share of the profits. The retraining of the algorithm might also have consequences for ByteDance's technology development. Running separate US and global algorithms, split workforces, and parallel governance adds engineering costs, slows innovation, and adds to the operational complexity, says Charlie Dai Principal Analyst in Technology Architecture & Delivery at Forrester. The India experience ByteDance has faced political and regulatory hurdles before. The loss of India in 2020 - then TikTok's largest market, with 200 million users - was a far bigger setback than any potential disruption in the US, says Chris Stokel-Walker, author of TikTok Boom: The Inside Story of the World's Favourite App. But, he says, even the India "setback" wasn't much of a setback. "They've continued to show growth despite these challenges." The struggles in both the US and India share a common thread: they were triggered by geopolitical tensions. The India ban, however, was not aimed at TikTok alone - it targeted China more broadly, with roughly 200 apps blocked across the country. And while that ban opened the door for homegrown platforms to emerge, none have come close to matching TikTok's success. For some, the TikTok deal inevitably invites comparisons with Huawei – another Chinese tech champion whose global ambitions have been reshaped by geopolitics. But there are stark differences, Huawei has been effectively locked out of Western markets after US sanctions cut off access to critical 5G infrastructure. TikTok by contrast has been allowed to remain, albeit on restrictive terms for ByteDance. Chris Stokel-Walker says this reflects a shift in how governments are responding to Chinese technology companies. Some are excluded altogether; others are permitted to operate, but only within tightly defined political and regulatory limits. A homegrown champion While TikTok is being reshaped abroad, it has full control over Douyin – its Chinese sister app – which is hugely successful in its own right within China. Douyin forms a core pillar of ByteDance's business – it is profitable, politically aligned and able to innovate because it is in charge of training the algorithm on data it has full access to. But ByteDance is also hedging its bets for the future, investing in data centres, the cloud and Artificial Intelligence, underscoring the company's efforts to diversify beyond advertising-led consumer apps. Chris Stokel-Walker argues that TikTok's predicament is no longer really about data security, but about who controls speech, culture and influence in the US. Trump has never liked that China might be shaping American culture, he says. The reality is that ByteDance will continue to operate TikTok in the US, but with distinct limitations. And this could spill over into other markets it plans to expand in with regulators looking for more control over Chinese technology. Other experts have said the licensing aspect of the deal could form a template for how other Chinese tech companies expand globally in an environment of increasing mistrust of Beijing.
