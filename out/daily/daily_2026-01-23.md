High stakes but low expectations ahead of Ukraine talks with Russia and US Negotiators from Russia, Ukraine and the US are due to meet in Abu Dhabi for their first trilateral talks since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Senior officials from all three nations are involved, but it is unclear whether they will be in the same room together at any point. And whilst the talks take a new format, the core differences remain the same. The stakes are high, but expectations are limited. Donald Trump is pushing hard for a peace deal in Ukraine – the one he promised but hasn't yet delivered – and he said this week that the two sides would be "stupid" if they couldn't agree. But despite some intense shuttle diplomacy by his own envoys, they are hosting the first trilateral talks between Ukrainian and Russian negotiators with some major issues still unresolved. Ukraine is engaging with the process because it wants peace more than anyone, but also because it needs to keep the US onside. It learned that lesson the hard way last year, when Donald Trump briefly suspended intelligence sharing and military aid. Now, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky says his talks with Trump in Davos were "really positive" and he hopes for more air defence support against Russia's relentless attacks as a result. Often grim-faced after his encounters with the US leader, this time Zelensky seemed unusually upbeat. But he remains cautious on the outcome of talks in the United Arab Emirates. He's described the meetings, which may last two days, as "a step", but shied away from calling it a positive one. "We have to wish it will push us a bit closer to peace," is how he put it. For a while, Zelensky has talked about being 90% of the way to producing a framework deal for peace, but the final 10% was always going to be the hardest - and Russia could still reject the whole thing. "It's all about the eastern part of our country. It's all about the land. This is the issue that's not resolved yet," he explained, spelling out the biggest obstacle that he says still remains. Russia insists that Ukraine should hand over the big slice of the eastern Donbas region, which it has failed to win on the battlefield. Ukraine refuses. Politicians often talk about their red lines, but for this country the line in the Donbas is drawn with the blood of the soldiers who died defending it. Zelensky can't cross it. As I write this, the music from another soldier's funeral is drifting up from a church in the street. On my way back into Ukraine this time, we drove passed so many military graves in roadside cemeteries, all marked with flags. The other big issue up for discussion in the UAE is what the US would do, militarily, if Russia were to invade Ukraine again someday. That's what Ukraine calls its "security guarantees", and says are essential. Zelensky says the deal between the US and Ukraine is done, but we have no real details. Russia's response also remains a wide-open question. There's also the giant new doubt about how good a guarantee from Donald Trump really is: the US president's fixation on "acquiring" Greenland has severely undermined Nato. He's also undermined the very principle of protecting a nation's sovereignty, the whole basis for Western support for Ukraine. So can Kyiv trust him to come to the rescue in the next crisis? For now, it doesn't have much choice. As for trusting Vladimir Putin, no one here is under any illusions that his aims have changed. "He really doesn't want it," is what Zelensky said in Davos about Putin and peace. The Kremlin has said that if it doesn't get what it wants at the talking table, it will "achieve its aims on the battlefield" - though it's failed so far, despite sacrificing huge number of soldiers. So once again, it's targeting civilian infrastructure across the country - but in a more deliberate, sustained, and devastating way than ever before. In the depths of a bitter winter, that's left people freezing in their homes. Today, the mayor of Kyiv again called on city residents to leave if they have somewhere to go. "The enemy will most likely continue to attack the critical infrastructure of the city and the country," Vitali Klitschko warned. After repeat attacks, the system is very fragile. "I address the residents and say honestly: the situation is extremely difficult and this may not be the most difficult moment yet."

'I didn't hear from my son for seven months': Inside Yemen's UAE-run secret prisons The BBC has been given access to detention facilities on former United Arab Emirates military bases in Yemen, confirming long-standing allegations of a network of secret prisons run by the UAE and forces allied to it in Yemen's decade-long civil war. One former detainee told the BBC he had been beaten and sexually abused at one of the sites. We saw cells at two bases in the south of the country, including shipping containers with names - apparently of detainees - and dates scratched into the sides. The UAE did not respond to our request for comment, but has previously denied similar allegations. Until recently, the Yemeni government, which is backed by Saudi Arabia, was allied with the UAE against the Houthi rebel movement which controls north-west Yemen. But the alliance between Yemen's two Gulf state partners has fractured. UAE forces pulled out of Yemen in early January and Yemeni government forces and groups allied to them have retaken large swathes of the south from separatists backed by the UAE. This includes the port of Mukalla, where we landed in a Saudi military plane and were taken to visit the former UAE military bases in the Al-Dhaba Oil Export Area. It has been almost impossible for international journalists to get visas to report from Yemen in recent years, but the government invited reporters to view the two sites, accompanied by Yemen's Information Minister Moammar al-Eryani. What we saw was consistent with accounts we have gathered independently, both in our previous reporting and also interviews conducted in Yemen, separately from the government-run site visit. 'No space to lie down' At one site, there were about 10 shipping containers, their interiors painted black, with little ventilation. Messages on the walls appeared to mark the dates detainees said they were brought in, or to count the number of days they had been held. Several were dated as recently as December 2025. At another military base, the BBC was shown eight cells built from brick and cement, including several measuring about one metre square and two metres tall, which Eryani said were used for solitary confinement. Human rights groups have documented testimony describing such facilities for years. Yemeni lawyer Huda al-Sarari has been gathering accounts. The BBC independently attended a meeting she organised, where about 70 people were present who said they had been held in Mukalla, as well as the families of another 30 who they said their relatives were still in detention. Several former detainees told us that each shipping container could hold up to 60 men at a time. They said prisoners were blindfolded, bound at the wrists and forced to remain sitting upright at all hours. "There was no space to lie down," one former prisoner told the BBC. "If someone collapsed, the others had to hold him up." 'All types of torture' The man also told the BBC he was beaten for three days after his arrest, with interrogators demanding he confess to being a member of al-Qaeda. "They told me if I didn't admit it, I would be sent to 'Guantanamo'," he said, referring to the US military detention centre at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. "I didn't even know what they meant by Guantanamo until they took me to their prison. Then I understood." He said he was held there for a year and a half, beaten daily and abused. "They didn't even feed us properly," he said. "If you wanted the toilet, they took you once. Sometimes you were so desperate you did it on yourself." He says his captors included Emirati soldiers as well as Yemeni fighters: "All types of torture - when we were interrogated it was the worst. They even sexually abused us and said they would bring in the 'doctor'. "This so-called doctor was Emirati. He beat us and told the Yemeni soldiers to beat us too. I tried to kill myself multiple times to make it end." The UAE was leading a counter-terror campaign in southern Yemen, but human rights groups say thousands of people were detained in crackdowns on political activists and critics. A mother told us her son was detained as a teenager and has been held for nine years. "My son was an athlete," she said. "He had just come back from competing abroad. That day he went to the gym and never came back." "I didn't hear from him for seven months," she said. "Then they let me see him for 10 minutes. I could see all the scars of the torture." She alleged that in the prison at the Emirati-run base, her teenage son was electrocuted, doused with ice-cold water and sexually abused multiple times. She says she attended a hearing in which her son's accusers played a recording of him apparently confessing. "You can hear him being beaten in the background and told what to say," she said. "My son is not a terrorist. You have robbed him of the best years of his life." Testimony and allegations Over the past decade, human rights groups and media organisations - including the BBC and Associated Press - have documented allegations of arbitrary detention, enforced disappearance and torture in detention centres run by the UAE and its allies. Human Rights Watch said in 2017 it had gathered testimonies of detainees held without charge or judicial oversight in unofficial facilities, and subjected to beatings, electric shocks and other forms of ill treatment. The UAE denied these allegations when they were made. The BBC sent detailed allegations to the UAE government about the detention sites we visited and accounts of abuse, but received no response. All sides have been accused of human rights violations in the civil war, which has sparked a devastating humanitarian crisis in the country. Families' questions Families of detainees told the BBC they had repeatedly raised concerns with Yemeni authorities. They believe it would have been impossible for the UAE and its allies to run a detention network without the Yemeni government and its Saudi backers knowing about it. The information minister, Eryani, said: "We weren't able to access locations that were under UAE control until now. "When we liberated them we discovered these prisons… we had been told by many victims that they existed but we didn't believe it was true." His government's decision to give access to international media comes as the rift between Saudi Arabia and the UAE is widening. Their long-strained relationship deteriorated in December when UAE-backed southern separatists, the Southern Transition Council (STC), seized territory controlled by government forces in two western provinces. Saudi Arabia then carried out a strike on what it said was a shipment of weapons from the UAE to the STC in Mukalla, and backed a demand from Yemen's presidential council for Emirati forces to leave the country immediately. The UAE withdrew and within days government forces and their allies retook control of the western provinces as well as all of the south. However, remaining separatists threaten the government's position in some places, including the southern port of Aden. The UAE denied that the shipment had contained weapons and also Saudi allegations that it was behind the STC's recent military campaign. Detainees 'still held' On 12 January 2026, the president of Yemen's Presidential Leadership Council, which oversees the government, Rashad al-Alimi, ordered the closure of all "illegal" prisons in southern provinces previously controlled by the STC, demanding the immediate release of those "held outside the framework of the law". Eryani said some detainees had been discovered inside the facilities, but did not give numbers or further details. Some relatives - including the mother of the athlete - told the BBC that detainees have since been transferred to prisons now nominally under government control. Yemeni authorities say transferring prisoners into the formal justice system is complex, while rights groups warn arbitrary detention may simply continue under different control. "The terrorists are out on the streets," the mother said. "Our sons are not terrorists."

US braces for 'extremely dangerous' winter storm More than 160 million Americans are expected to face an unusually brutal winter storm from Friday, with heavy snows and freezing rains forecast. The storm is expected to sweep through much of the United States, leaving "extremely dangerous" conditions in its wake as it tracks eastwards from the High Plains and Rockies, the National Weather Service (NWS) said. It warned that the Arctic blast will bring sub-zero temperatures and wind chills, which "pose a life-threatening risk of hypothermia and frostbite to exposed skin". US transportation officials, including airport authorities in several major cities, have warned of weekend travel disruption, delays and cancellations. The winter storm is forecast to move slowly across the US, blanketing cities including Memphis, Nashville, Washington DC, Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York with snow. Heavy snow is predicted through the Southern Rockies and Plains, into the Mid-Atlantic and reaching the Northeast. According to the NWS Probabilistic Precipitation Portal, the regions that could see more than a foot of snow stretch from Colorado to West Virginia to Boston. Numerous low temperature records are likely to be broken, according to the NWS, with the coldest wind chills potentially falling below -50F (-46C) across the Northern Plains. A much wider area of the south-eastern US is also forecast to experience freezing temperatures. Governors in several US states, including Arkansas, Georgia, Texas, North Carolina, South Carolina, have declared states of emergency, allowing emergency officials - including National Guard troops - to begin mobilising response efforts. Some airlines have offered passengers the option to change their flights, in some cases without incurring extra fees, due to concerns about cancellations. Motorists should avoid driving across the weekend, with travel expected to be "nearly impossible during the peak of the storm", NWS meteorologists Rich Otto and Tony Fracasso told the BBC's US news partner CBS. In Canada, freezing temperatures are already gripping the country, with snowfall expected in eastern and Atlantic regions on Monday, meteorologist Geoff Coulson told CBC earlier in the week.

Pakistan mall fire death toll jumps to 67 The death toll in a fire which engulfed a shopping centre in Pakistan has climbed to 67, police have confirmed. Police say 77 people are currently reported as missing by their families following the fire at Gul Plaza, in Pakistan's largest city Karachi, on Saturday evening. But the scale of the damage following the blaze - which took more than 24 hours to put out - has slowed rescue efforts, as authorities comb the remains of the 6,500sq m (70,000 sq ft) complex. While some of the bodies found are only partial remains, authorities had been able to count 67 skulls, the deputy commissioner of police told the BBC. The process to identify the bodies continues, with 15 people identified so far. Gul Plaza had housed some 1,200 shops, spread across multiple floors. It is wedding season in Karachi, often a particularly busy time of year for shoppers. While the cause of the fire is still unknown, witnesses earlier told the BBC that a lack of working fire exits and the density of shoppers and stalls crammed into the building exacerbated the disaster. Shop owner Rehan Faisal recounted how it only took about "five to seven minutes" for everything to "burn before our eyes". "Many customers and shopkeepers were coming up... and saying there was a fire downstairs. I was just beginning to comprehend the situation when the shop owner told me to lock up and get out," he told BBC Urdu. With the facility due to close soon, most of the gates of the shopping centre were locked, witnesses said. Senior police official Syed Asad Raza told Reuters news agency that all but three of the centre's 16 exits were locked.

**Excerpt**

Trump withdraws Canada's invitation to Board of Peace US President Donald Trump has withdrawn an invitation for Canada to join his newly constituted Board of Peace, in the latest spat between the North American neighbours. "Please let this Letter serve to represent that the Board of Peace is withdrawing its invitation to you regarding Canada's joining," Trump said on Truth Social in a post addressed to Prime Minister Mark Carney, who made headlines this week when he warned of a "rupture" in the US-led global order. Canada had indicated that while it would not pay to be on the board, it would join. Meanwhile, EU chief Antonio Costa said European leaders have serious doubts about the scope of the board, but were willing to work with the body in Gaza. The board, which gives Trump wide decision-making powers as chairman, is being billed by the US as a new international organisation for resolving conflicts. Trump did not give a reason in Thursday evening's post as to why he had decided to revoke Canada's offer. Carney's office did not immediately respond. The prime minster had indicated last week he would accept Trump's offer on principle. But Ottawa had indicated in recent days that it would not pay the $1bn (£740m) membership fee which Trump has said permanent members will be asked to pay to help fund the board. Trump's Board of Peace was originally thought to be aimed at helping end the two-year war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza and oversee reconstruction. But its proposed charter does not mention the Palestinian territory and appears to be designed to supplant functions of the UN. Trump would be chairman for life. Some 60 nations have been invited to join the board and about 35 have already signed up, according to the White House. Those who have agreed to join so far include Argentina, Belarus, Morocco, Vietnam, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kosovo, Hungary, Egypt, Turkey, Qatar, Jordan, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia. But none of the other permanent members of the UN Security Council - China, France, Russia, and the UK - have committed to participation so far. The UK has expressed concerns about the inclusion of Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose forces are fighting in Ukraine after invading in 2022. France said the charter as it currently stood was "incompatible" with its international commitments, especially its UN membership. European Council president Antonio Costa said European leaders have doubts about the scope of the board, but were ready to work with the US and the newly founded body in Gaza. Speaking on Friday after an EU leaders' summit in Brussels, Costa said, "We have serious doubts about a number of elements in the charter of the Board of Peace related to its scope, its governance and its compatibility with the UN Charter." But he said the EU was "ready to work together with the US on the implementation of the comprehensive Peace Plan for Gaza, with a Board of Peace carrying out its mission as a transitional administration". After the EU leaders' summit, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez told reporters that his country had "declined" the invitation to participate in the body. Trump's withdrawal of Canada's invitation came after Carney appeared to irk Trump with a speech that won a rare standing ovation this week at the World Economic Forum in Davos. The prime minister urged other "middle powers" to band together in the face of economic coercion by "greater powers", although he did not mention the US president by name. A day later Trump told the gathering in the Swiss Alpine resort that Canada gets many "freebies" from the US and it "should be grateful". "Canada lives because of the United States," Trump said. "Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements." On Thursday, Carney swiped back at Trump as he delivered another speech back on home turf. Speaking in Quebec, he said: "Canada doesn't live because of the United States. Canada thrives because we are Canadians."

**Excerpt**

Taliban release female athlete, 22, after 13 days in jail A 22-year-old Afghan woman who was reportedly running a taekwondo gym for girls has been released after spending 13 days in jail, a spokesman for the Taliban's supreme court confirmed. Khadija Ahmadzada was detained for being in "violation" of rules "regarding women's sports gyms", a spokesman for the Taliban's ministry of vice and virtue told the BBC. Sports clubs have been closed to women since 2021, shortly after the Taliban returned to power. At the time, it was said they would reopen once a "safe environment" - which does not contravene the Taliban's strict interpretation of Islamic law - had been established. As of January 2026, no sports club has reopened, while women are still unable to compete. It is one of a raft of measures that have been imposed on women by the Taliban since 2021, which have seen their rights to education and work curtailed as well as strict rules around clothing imposed. Ahmadzada, who lives near the western city of Herat, was detained with a number of other people after "violations were observed" by vice and virtue inspectors, the ministry spokesman said. She was accused of not wearing "a proper hijab", "playing music" and allowing genders to mix in her gym and sentenced to 13 days in jail. The spokesman said she had been given multiple warnings. The case was then referred to the supreme court, which announced she would be released on Thursday 22 January. It is unclear where she is now. News of Ahmadzada's arrest led to an outcry on social media, attracting the attention of Richard Bennett, the United Nations' special rapporteur on human rights in Afghanistan, who posted online calling for her immediate release. He also highlighted the case of female journalist Nazira Rashidi, in the northern city of Kunduz, who was detained in late December. Taliban spokesmen deny her detention is related to her work as a journalist, according to local media.

**Excerpt**

Could Trump's new Board of Peace sideline the struggling UN? "Together we are in a position to… end decades of suffering, stop generations of hatred and bloodshed, and forge a beautiful, everlasting and glorious peace for that region and for the whole region of the world." Such was the soaring promise of US President Donald Trump as he inaugurated his new Board of Peace on the stage of stages that is the Davos Economic Forum this week. The world of all too much suffering and strife badly wants to believe him. But for many observers and officials in capitals the world over, it is yet more proof of Trump's drive to dismantle the post-war international architecture and replace it with new institutions - dominated by him. "We will not let anyone play us," Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk warned tersely on social media. But from Trump's biggest backer in Europe, Viktor Orban, came effusive praise: "If Trump, then peace." What exactly will this Board, headed in perpetuity by Trump himself, do? Could this really be a bid to build a UN mini-me? Power of the Board chairman The idea - born last year in US-led efforts to end the war in Gaza and endorsed by a UN Security Council resolution - now has a much greater, far grander, more global ambition. And it pivots around the president. In leaked details of the draft charter he is the Board's chairman for life even when he leaves office. Under that charter his powers would be vast: authority to invite member states or not; to create or dissolve subsidiary bodies; and the mandate to appoint his successor whenever he decides to step down, or if he is incapacitated. If any other country would like to become a permanent member, the price is an eye-watering $1 billion (£740m). This latest bombshell lands in what is already a head-spinning month. In a few short weeks there's already been the US capture of Venezuela's leader, Trump threats and preparations for military action against Iran, and demands to acquire Greenland which sent shock waves across Europe and beyond. Nineteen countries showed up in Davos for the Board's inauguration from all corners of the compass - from Argentina to Azerbaijan, from former Soviet republics to Gulf kingdoms. Many more are said to have "agreed to join". "In this group, I like every single one of them," Trump grinned as he eyed leaders and officials whose names are now on this Board or the layers of executive bodies beneath it. Many more potential members have so far politely demurred. "This is about a treaty that raises much broader issues, and we do also have concerns about President Putin being part of something that is talking about peace" explained the UK's Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper. Trump says Russia is on board although the message from Moscow was that they were still "consulting partners". "As the text stands right now," we're not joining, replied Sweden. "The proposal raises unanswered questions that require further dialogue with Washington" was Norway's diplomatic response. Even a group of seven predominantly Muslim countries, including six Arab nations, as well as Turkey and Indonesia, made it clear they were in it for a "just and lasting peace in Gaza," including the reconstruction of the shattered enclave. However leaked details of the Board's charter don't mention Gaza. For some of the critics, including some countries reluctant to join, it's a vainglorious project for a president who doesn't hide his fixation with winning the biggest accolade – the Nobel Peace Prize, which was won by President Obama in 2009 at the start of his first term in the White House. World leaders know there may be a price to pay for not joining this new club. "I'll put a 200% tariff on his wines and champagnes, and he'll join, but he doesn't have to join." This was the president's rebuke to France's President Emmanuel Macron with a threat to wield his weapon of choice. Only Slovenia said the quiet part out loud. Prime Minister Robert Golob made his concern clear – it "dangerously interferes with the broader international order". Trump addressed this concern head-on. "Once this Board is completely formed, we can do pretty much whatever we want to do and we'll do it in conjunction with the United Nations," he explained to the packed hall hanging on his every word. But he likes to keep the world guessing. A day earlier, when asked by a Fox TV journalist whether his Board would replace the UN, he replied "Well it might. The UN just hasn't been very helpful." Then he added "I'm a big fan of the UN potential, but it has never lived up to its potential. The UN should have settled every one of the wars that I settled." A new contender for peacemaker-in-chief? The UN, 193 members strong, has indeed long lost its role as peacemaker-in-chief. When I interviewed the Secretary General António Guterres in October 2016, on his first day in his first term, just hours after a rare unanimous endorsement by the Security Council, he promised "a surge in diplomacy for peace". For the past decade, the UN's efforts were thwarted by the gridlocked Security Council, the growing number of spoilers and state sponsors in wars the world over, as well as the steady erosion in its own standing vis-a-vis the world's most powerful players, including the United States. "We must all welcome the activism of Mr Trump on ending wars," says Martin Griffiths, a UN veteran who believes this new effort is "obviously a reflection of the failure of the UN Security Council and of the UN writ large." But the former Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator cautioned that "what we've learned over these last 80 years, through lots and lots of failures and clunkiness, we learned the value of inclusion, of being representative of the global community, not just the friends of Mr Trump." Guterres himself recently regretted that "there are those that believe the power of law should be replaced by the law of power". Asked in an interview with the BBC's Today programme about Trump's constant claim that he's ended eight wars, he replied matter-of-factly "they are ceasefires." Some have already broken down. The temporary peace deal between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo soon fell apart, Cambodia and Thailand started hurling accusations and more across their border, and India disputed Trump's central role in ending its conflagration with Pakistan. But only Trump's muscular mediation could have ended the 12-day war between Iran and Israel. His own personal involvement finally secured a ceasefire in Gaza's destructive confrontation last October which eased both the suffering of Palestinians, and the agony of Israeli hostages. His decision to finally and fully focus on this disaster, partly in response to urging from his closest Arab allies and grieving Israeli families, pushed him to pressure Israel's Prime Minister Netanyahu and Hamas, to do a deal. But even the Board's first test – to move from the first phase of the deal to end the Gaza war – is daunting. Even now, as this new Board slowly takes shape, it includes Netanyahu who has vowed to stop the establishment of a Palestinian state, and Arab leaders who insist the only pathway to a sustainable peace must lead to Palestinian self-governance and the end of Israeli occupation. And the other big war on America's - and Europe's agenda - is Ukraine. President Zelensky has balked at being at the same table as Moscow and Minsk. Three layers lie beneath this Board, most focusing on Gaza – an Executive Board, a Gaza Executive Board, and the National Committee for the Administration for Gaza. They bring together a mix of senior American officials and billionaires, as well as respected former politicians and ex-UN envoys who know Gaza well, along with Arab ministers and intelligence chiefs, and Palestinian technocrats. Even some critics credit the president with putting an age-old battle of a different kind on the table – the incessant demand to reform the UN's post-war architecture including a Security Council which no longer aligns with the world's political map of major powers in every region. It's simply not fit for purpose. "Maybe an unintended good consequence of what Trump has done is those issues will be pushed back towards the top of the international agenda," reflected Mark Malloch Brown, the former UN deputy secretary-general. "We're coming out of a period of extremely weak UN leadership and I think this could be a call to action." Ironically, Trump's bid to lead the world towards peace comes as discussions gather steam in many capitals to replace Guterres who completes his second term at the end of this year. The president, who previously declared that he could end the Ukraine war in a day, has learned in his last year in power that peacemaking is a protracted and perilous process. But today he hailed a Middle East region where only "little fires" were burning now. He promised that a settlement in Ukraine "is coming very soon". And he revelled in his new role as would-be peacemaker-in-chief. "This is for the world" he exclaimed.

Mandela's prison key, sunglasses and shirt can be sold after daughter wins court battle A South African court has dismissed an appeal by the country's heritage body to stop the sale and export of various artefacts connected to anti-apartheid hero Nelson Mandela. The 70 personal items include a cell key from Robben Island, where Mandela was imprisoned for 18 of the 27 years he was locked up, a pair of Aviator sunglasses and one of his signature floral shirts. They were due to be exported to the US for auction. The objects belong to his eldest daughter, Makaziwe Mandela and Christo Brand, a Robben Island warden during Mandela's incarceration. In trying to stop their sale, the authorities said they were part of the country's heritage and were therefore legally protected from export. The South African Heritage Resources Agency (Sahra) first found out about the potential sale in a British newspaper article from late 2021, claiming that the key would go for more than £1m ($1.35m). The agency then wrote to the US auction house, Guernsey, that was planning the sale to ask it to suspend the auction and return the assets to South Africa. Other items in the lot were a copy of the 1996 South African Constitution personally signed by Mandela, one of his charcoal drawings, an ID card, a tennis racquet he used on Robben Island and gifts from world leaders, including one from former US President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle. Mandela's daughter wanted to use the proceeds from the sale to build a memorial garden at the late former resident's grave in Qunu, in Mthatha, Eastern Cape province. In its ruling, the Supreme Court of Appeal argues that Sahra's interpretation of what items fell under the National Heritage Resources Act was overly broad. The ruling also states that whereas Makaziwe and Brand explained in detail why their respective assets were not heritage objects, Sahra made no attempt to explain on what grounds it believed they were. It is not yet clear whether the authorities will seek other legal avenues to block the sale. The BBC has contacted the sport, arts and culture department for comment. Makaziwe, Mandela's only daughter with his first wife, welcomed the Supreme Court's judgment, blasting the heritage agency for presuming "to know my father's last wishes better than those who were beside him at the end - his family". "Nobody is more invested in ensuring Tata's [Mandela's] legacy endures in the way he would want to be remembered than those who carry his name," she said. She added that no decision had yet been made on what would happen to the items meant to go on auction. Some supporters of the government's position argued that items connected to Mandela should not be sold or exported but instead kept in South Africa for future generations. Others believe that Mandela's family should decide what happens to the objects. Mandela died in 2013 at the age of 95. He led the African National Congress in its struggle against apartheid - a system of legally enforced racism - and was released from prison in 1990. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 along with then-President FW de Klerk. Mandela became South Africa's first democratically elected president in 1994.

Dozens of sanctioned Russian tankers navigate Channel despite UK vow of 'assertive' action Dozens of oil tankers sanctioned by the UK in response to Russia's war in Ukraine have sailed through the English Channel this month despite defence officials vowing to take "assertive action". Since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia has used hundreds of ageing tankers with obscured ownership - known as the shadow fleet - to evade sanctions on its oil exports. The BBC understands that the UK government received legal assurances earlier this month that such vessels can be detained. Yet 42 sanctioned tankers tracked by BBC Verify passing through the English Channel did so after that advice was received. Among them was the Sofos - a tanker sanctioned by the UK Foreign Office in May 2025. It moved through the Channel after travelling from Venezuela and is now near the Russian city of St Petersburg. Ship-tracking data shows the Sofos loaded oil in Russia in mid-November, before travelling to Turkey and then to Venezuela, where it switched off its tracking signal. Satellite imagery later placed it at Venezuela's Jose oil terminal on 22 and 23 December, before its signal reappeared outside the country's waters on 26 December. The Nasledie, a tanker which is more than 20 years old, also entered the Channel in January. The ship was sanctioned by the UK in May 2025 and according to Anna Zhminko, an analyst at Maritime Intelligence firm Vortexa, has been part of the shadow fleet since 2023. In November the ship had a makeover, changing its name from Blint and switching to a Russian registry after falsely flying under the Comoros flag. It left Russia in late December and just days after the BBC reported on the UK's legal advice it entered the Channel carrying about 100,000 tonnes of Urals crude, Russia's flagship oil grade. The shadow fleet has helped Russia to mitigate the impact of an embargo imposed on its oil exports since 2022 and has helped prop up an economy battered by Western sanctions. In January, Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said the British government was ready to "tighten the chokehold" on Russia and take new "assertive actions" against shadow fleet vessels. Her comments came after officials were told troops could board and seize tankers under the Sanctions and Money Act 2018. This is despite BBC Verify identifying six tankers operating in the Channel under false flags since the beginning of January. This means the ships are not registered in the states they publicly claim to be registered in. Under the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea such tankers can be seized as stateless vessels. Dame Emily Thornberry, chair of Parliament's Foreign Affairs Select Committee, said she was "very disappointed" that the vessels had not been intercepted. "I think in order to give Ukraine proper support, we have to have not only sanctions that look on paper, but we have to make sure we mean it and that we implement those sanctions," she said. Mike Martin, a Liberal Democrat MP and former British Army officer, questioned why the UK has been reluctant to board the tankers independently, noting that the UK's Royal Marines are trained and equipped for such operations. "Its not that hard to project force 12 miles off the Straits of Dover," he said. "It's not that difficult to board a tanker." Russia also appears to have reacted to the UK's vow to take more assertive action against the shadow fleet. On 20 January the Times reported that a warship escorted sanctioned tanker General Skobelev through the Channel. And on 15 January, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the Kremlin would view any detention of the tankers as a violation of international law which would be seen as "harming Russian interests". In a statement to BBC Verify, a Ministry of Defence spokesperson said: "Deterring, disrupting and degrading the Russian shadow fleet is a priority for this government. Alongside our allies, we are stepping up our response to shadow vessels – and we will continue to do so." Tankers ignore UK warnings Other tankers which have been sanctioned by the US and EU, but not the UK, have also sailed through the Channel over the course of January. BBC Verify identified one vessel that took extreme measures to avoid detection and has been labelled by maritime experts as "the darkest of the dark fleet". The Arcusat - previously sanctioned by the US as the Tia, before changing its identity in 2024 - passed through the Channel on 8 January before being stopped by German federal police and turned around before it entered the country's waters. Last year, it obtained a new IMO number in a move that analysts said was almost unheard of. The unique code identifies ships and is supposed to be associated with a vessel for life, irrespective of changes of name or ownership. Despite mounting calls for tougher enforcement, shadow fleet vessels remain difficult to monitor. Sanctioned tankers will deploy several strategies to evade detection - including flying under false flags, switching off their tracking signals, and broadcasting false locations. "Once vessels start doing these direct port calls within Russia, they're less afraid of compliance," Zhminko told BBC Verify. "Because it is already sanctioned it is easier for her to be a part of the open shadow fleet - she can't do any mainstream market port calls because she is already sanctioned." According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), the shadow fleet tankers move between $87bn-$100bn worth of oil per year. Vaibhav Raghunandan, an analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, said that 68% of all Russian crude oil was carried on sanctioned tankers in December 2025. Mike Martin MP said that the revenue generated by the shadow fleet was helping to fund Russia's war in Ukraine and providing the Kremlin with an economic lifeline. He said the conflict would only come to an end "when Russia's economy collapses". "A key lever we have to pull is knock out oil sales through the shadow fleet," Martin told BBC Verify. "So I think it's massively important, it's irritating we didn't get on it much earlier." Additional reporting by Matt Murphy, Jack Fenwick and Joshua Cheetham. Correction: The General Skobelev is the name of the sanctioned Russian tanker that was in the Channel, not the warship escorting it.

'Blood was all over' - victim of Nigeria church abduction describes escape There was a huge plaster on Sarah Peter's head to staunch the bleeding caused by the blow of a gunman's weapon. Sarah, not her real name, was in church in a village in northern Nigeria on Sunday morning when attackers raided the compound to abduct the worshippers and take them away on foot. The 60-year-old was whacked on the skull with a rifle to encourage her to move. "Blood was all over," she said, her fingers brushing the area where the wound was. "I suffered," she added, clearly still traumatised by what happened three days earlier. "They kept dragging me even when I told them I couldn't walk. Then I hid somewhere until I couldn't see them any more. I was so weak I had to crawl back to the village." Dozens of others were taken away from her branch of the Cherubim and Seraphim Movement Church and two other churches in Kurmin Wali, a village 135km (84 miles) north of the capital, Abuja. Although 11 people managed to escape, including Sarah, more than 160 people are still unaccounted for, according to the local branch of the Christian Association of Nigeria. The remaining villagers have been left devastated and fear more attacks. Authorities have not released any figures for those missing. Kurmin Wali is near Kaduna state's Rijana forest, a hideout for armed gangs, known here as "bandits", who have been carrying out raids and abductions in the region. No group has said it was behind Sunday's raid, but the attack is part of a wider security crisis in Nigeria, with kidnapping for ransom becoming more common. Paying kidnappers is illegal in Nigeria but it is often suspected that money has been handed over to free those who have been abducted. In this case, no ransom demand has been reported. There has been an increasing international focus on the issue after US President Donald Trump alleged last year that Christians were being targeted and killed in record numbers. Last month, the US military carried out air strikes on camps of suspected Islamist militants in Nigeria's north-west. Nigerian officials have denied that Christians were being singled out because of their faith, and have said Muslims, Christians and those with no religion have all been affected by the insecurity. There is an air of tension and anger in Kurmin Wali. The village head said people had been living in fear for a while. Local residents have been urging authorities to improve security and have accused them of trying to suppress information in the wake of Sunday's raid. Forty-eight hours of confusion followed the attack as officials initially denied anything had happened, despite eyewitness reports, only to finally confirm events on Tuesday evening. "They told us not to give out any information, they want to intimidate us but we must tell our story. They have also been stopping some journalists from coming to the town," said a young man in his 20s, who wished to remain anonymous. It is not clear why the authorities may have been reluctant for news to get out, but Kaduna state governor Uba Sani told the BBC that officials wanted to confirm details first before making any statements. However, that does not explain why the local police chief and a state official initially denied there had been any attack, describing the reports as a "mere falsehood which is being peddled by conflict entrepreneurs who want to cause chaos". The BBC also faced difficulties reaching Kurmin Wali, after a politician and security personnel attempted to block access to the village. But we managed to get through and once inside, we found a scene of chaos in the building of the Cherubim and Seraphim Movement Church. Colourful plastic chairs were on their sides, prayer books scattered on the floor and musical instruments broken, as if the moment after the attack had been frozen in time. Nearby, Christopher Yohanna was looking forlornly at his two-year-old daughter. He said he managed to escape from the attackers with his child. "We were in the church when we heard shouting. When we came out and tried to run, we saw that gunmen had already surrounded the village." He was lucky not to be caught, but he is devastated because his two wives and other children were not so lucky. "If my family is not with me then my life is worthless and free of any joy," he said. Governor Sani was in Kurmin Wali three days after the attack, pledging to establish a military base, a hospital and a road in the area. He also announced relief measures for affected residents, including medical support. "We cannot relocate them because they have to farm… but to ensure that we protect them going forward, we need to have a military base around that area between that village and Rijana forest," he told the BBC. He also said efforts were under way to work with security agencies to rescue those still in captivity. "When we met [the villagers] I affirmed that we are with them and… we will not let any of them down." As the residents of Kurmin Wali wait anxiously for the return of their family members, they are hoping the governor keeps to his word. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

Indian state investigates killings of hundreds of stray dogs Authorities in the southern Indian state of Telangana have launched an investigation after hundreds of stray dogs were killed across at least six villages in the past month. Police say they have confirmed at least 354 killings so far and arrested nine people in connection with some of the cases. Animal welfare activists have told the BBC that the dogs were either poisoned or given lethal injections, but police say they are waiting for forensic reports to establish the method used. Villagers have said that the killings were linked to promises made by candidates during recent local election campaigns to get rid of stray dogs and monkeys. The killings have come at a time when India is witnessing a larger debate about stray animals and the country's top court is hearing petitions about how to rid the city streets, including in the capital Delhi, of stray dogs. But killings on such a large scale are rare and have elicited outrage. Stray animals - mostly dogs but also cattle and monkeys - are considered a persistent problem in many parts of India, where they are often blamed for attacks on people, crop damage and traffic accidents. The problem is attributed to a combination of factors, including gaps in sterilisation and vaccination programmes, rubbish piling up, abandonment of animals, shrinking forest habitats and uneven enforcement of laws. While stray dogs, in particular, are often enmeshed in the fabric of daily life, forming strong bonds with local communities, animal rights activists have frequently flagged cruelty towards them, warning that the country does not have strong enough penalties. Telangana state minister Danasari Anasuya Seethakka told the Hindu newspaper that the killings were "illegal" and "inhumane", warning that those responsible would face strict action. The issue of how to handle stray dogs is also being debated at present in the Supreme Court. In August last year, the court ordered authorities in Delhi and its suburbs to move all stray dogs from streets to animal shelters in just two months. After widespread protests, the court modified the order, asking for the animals to be immunised and vaccinated before being released back to their neighbourhoods. Animal welfare groups argue that putting dogs into already-overburdened shelters is unscientific, while those seeking removal of stray dogs from public places say unchecked populations is endangering people's lives and livelihoods. The killings in Telangana were spread across three districts and occurred between late December and mid-January. Police say they may have taken place over several days in each location. In Kamareddy district, "244 dogs died and were buried in four locations", S Anil, a police sub-inspector, told BBC Telugu. "Government veterinary doctors have conducted post-mortems and sent samples to the lab," said Anil, adding that council heads of three villages were found to be involved. In Shayampet and Arepally villages near Telangana's Warangal city, police say 110 dogs were killed. Police sub-inspector J Parameshwar told BBC Telugu that nine people, including village council heads, have been arrested. In Jagtial city, police are investigating a complaint that around 40 dogs were killed on 28 and 30 December but no bodies had been recovered so far. Minister Seethakka told the Hindu newspaper that killing stray dogs under the pretext of population control could not be justified under any circumstances. The government has issued clear instructions to all village councils to prevent a recurrence of such incidents, she added. Animal welfare activists allege that the number of dogs that have been culled is much higher than what the police have confirmed so far. Some residents, however, have defended the killings. Raju (who goes by just his first name), the son of the Arepally village head, told the BBC that only rabid dogs were killed, saying they were diseased, aggressive and had caused road accidents and serious injuries. Another resident, Vijay (goes by first name), said most villagers supported the decision, citing fears of dog bites and disease. Telangana recorded nearly 122,000 dog bite cases in 2024, according to federal government records, but no dog bite-related rabies deaths were recorded in the same period. The dog killings have coincided with other alleged incidents involving stray animals in Telangana, including a case reported by The Times of India in which several monkeys were found dead or critically injured after being allegedly tranquillised and dumped along a highway in Kamareddy district.

**Excerpt**

US unveils plans for 'New Gaza' with skyscrapers The US has unveiled its plans for a "New Gaza" that would see the devastated Palestinian territory rebuilt from scratch. Slides showed dozens of skyscrapers stretching along the Mediterranean coast and housing estates in the Rafah area, while a map outlining the phased development of new residential, agricultural and industrial areas for the 2.1 million population. They were presented during a signing ceremony at the World Economic Forum in Davos for President Donald Trump's new Board of Peace, which is tasked with ending the two-year war between Israel and Hamas and overseeing reconstruction. "We're going to be very successful in Gaza. It's going to be a great thing to watch," Trump declared. "I'm a real estate person at heart and it's all about location. And I said: 'Look at this location on the sea. Look at this beautiful piece of property. What it could be for so many people.'" Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, who helped broker the ceasefire that took effect in October, said 90,000 tonnes of munitions had been dropped on Gaza and there were 60 million tonnes of rubble to clear. "In the beginning, we were toying with the idea of saying: 'Let's build a free zone, and then we have a Hamas zone.' And then we said: 'You know what, let's just plan for catastrophic success'," he told the ceremony. "Hamas signed a deal to demilitarise, that is what we are going to enforce. People ask us what our plan B is. We do not have a plan B." A map of the US "Master Plan" showed a zone reserved for "coastal tourism", where there would be 180 tower-blocks as well a number of zones for "residential areas", "industrial complex, data centres, advanced manufacturing" and "parks, agriculture and sports facilities". A new seaport and airport would be built near the Egyptian border, and there would a "trilateral crossing" where the Egyptian and Israeli borders converge. Redevelopment would be divided into four phases, starting in Rafah and then gradually moving north towards Gaza City. The map also featured an empty strip of land running along the Egyptian and Israeli borders. It appeared to mark what Trump's 20-point peace plan refers to as the "security perimeter" where Israeli forces will remain "until Gaza is properly secure". Another slide said "New Rafah" would have more than 100,000 permanent housing units, 200 education centres and 75 medical facilities. About 280,000 people once lived in Gaza's southernmost city, but it has been largely levelled by Israeli strikes and controlled demolitions during the war and is currently located inside Israeli-controlled territory. Kushner said he believed it was "doable" to complete the construction of "New Rafah" in two to three years. "We've already started removing the rubble and doing some of the demolition. And then New Gaza. It could be a hope, it could be a destination, have a lot of industry." In the coming weeks, he added, there would be a conference in Washington where contributions from countries would be announced and "amazing investment opportunities" for the private sector outlined. Last February, Trump sparked outrage around the world when he suggested that Gaza's Palestinians could be permanently relocated to neighbouring countries, with the US taking over the territory to transform it into "the Riviera of the Middle East". Kushner also declared that the demilitarisation of Gaza was "starting now", noting that "without security nobody is going to make investments". He said the territory's new technocratic Palestinian government, the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG), would be "working with Hamas on demilitarisation to really take the principles that were agreed to in the document to the next phase". Hamas has previously refused to give up its weapons without the creation of an independent Palestinian state. But Trump warned the group: "They have to give up their weapons and if they don't do that, it's going to be the end of them." Trump also insisted Hamas hand over the body of the last dead Israeli hostage in Gaza, which Israel said should have happened before phase two of the peace plan began last week. Under phase one, Hamas and Israel agreed to the ceasefire, an exchange of all living and dead Israeli hostages in Gaza for Palestinians detained in Israeli jails, a partial Israeli withdrawal, and a surge in deliveries of humanitarian aid. The ceasefire has remained fragile, with at least 477 Palestinians killed in Israeli strikes over the past three months, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. The Israeli military says three of its soldiers have been killed in attacks by Palestinian armed groups. Five people were reportedly killed by Israeli fire across Gaza on Thursday, four of them in an artillery strike in the eastern Zeitoun neighbourhood of Gaza City. Humanitarian conditions also still dire, with almost 1 million people lacking adequate shelter and 1.6 million facing high levels of acute food insecurity, according to the UN. Hamas put out a statement on Thursday saying that it remained committed to the October agreement and accusing Israel of seeking to "undermine international efforts aimed at consolidating the ceasefire". Speaking at Davos, Israeli President Isaac Herzog praised the "efforts of President Trump and his leadership". But he warned: "The real test has to be Hamas leaving Gaza". President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority (PA), which governs in parts of the occupied West Bank, called for the full implementation of the peace plan, including the withdrawal of Israeli forces, and a central role for the PA in administering Gaza. The head of the NCAG, Ali Shaath, meanwhile announced that the Rafah border crossing with Egypt would open next week in both directions. It has been mostly closed since May 2024, when the Palestinian side was seized by Israeli forces. "Opening Rafah signals that Gaza is no longer closed to the future and to the war," he said. The war was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. Israel responded to the attack by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 71,560 people have been killed, according to the territory's health ministry.

ICE detains five-year-old and father in Minnesota, lawyer says US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers detained a five-year-old boy on Tuesday during an immigration enforcement operation, Minnesota school officials and the family's lawyer have said. Pre-schooler Liam Ramos was with his father - named by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) as Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias - when Conejo Arias was approached by agents on his driveway. In a statement posted on X, the DHS said "ICE did NOT target a child", but was conducting an operation against his father, an "illegal alien" who "abandoned" his son when approached. Zena Stenvik, the Columbia Heights Public Schools superintendent, asked: "Why detain a five-year-old? "You can't tell me that this child is going to be classified as a violent criminal." In a post on X, ICE denied the child had been detained. "A criminal illegal alien ABANDONED his child as he fled from ICE officers, and our officers ensured the child was kept SAFE in the bitter cold," the agency said. "ICE made multiple attempts to get the family inside the house to take custody of the child. "They refused to accept custody of the child. The father told officers he wanted the child to remain with him." DHS did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment. Photos provided to the BBC by the school district show a boy, identified as Liam Ramos, wearing a bunny-shaped winter hat, standing outside as an officer holds on to his backpack. The Columbia Heights Public Schools authority described these as bystander photos. The district did not identify the individuals who took the pictures, referring to them as "known and confirmed community members". Marc Prokosch, a lawyer representing the family, told a press conference on Thursday that Liam and his father were being held at a detention centre in San Antonio, Texas, and attorneys were trying to contact them. Prokosch said the boy and his father had come to the US in 2024 from Ecuador to seek asylum. "This family was not eluding ICE in any way," he said. "They were following all the established protocols." School officials said an agent asked the child to knock on the door of the home to see if anyone else was there. The boy had just arrived home from pre-school at the time, Stenvik told the press conference. She said another adult living in the home asked to take the young boy inside, but was refused. School board member Mary Granlund said she was on the scene and told immigration officials she could take Liam Ramos, but they still detained him. US Vice-President JD Vance, who visited Minnesota on Thursday amid ongoing protests against immigration enforcement, told reporters ICE had no choice because "the father ran". "What are they supposed to do?" he said of ICE agents. "Are they supposed to let a five-year-old child freeze to death? "Are they not supposed to arrest an illegal alien in the United States of America?" He added: "If the argument is that you can't arrest people who have violated laws because they have children. . . that doesn't make any sense." Stenvik said that ICE had recently detained a total of four students in her school district, including a 10-year-old, and two 17-year-olds. "The onslaught of ICE activity in our community is inducing trauma," Stenvik told reporters. The DHS maintains it is arresting the "worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens" in an effort to restore public safety in Minnesota. At a DHS press conference on Tuesday, Gregory Bovino of the US Border Patrol said: "Our operations are lawful, are targeted, and are focused on individuals who pose a serious threat to this community." The immigration enforcement initiative, dubbed Operation Metro Surge, has sparked outcry from residents in Minneapolis, St Paul and other cities in the state. On 7 January, a federal officer fatally shot a woman named Renee Good in Minneapolis, sparking protests and condemnation from local and state officials. The Trump administration alleged the 37-year-old was using her vehicle as a weapon and the officer acted in self-defence. Also on Thursday, seven Democrats in the US House of Representatives voted with Republicans to narrowly pass $1.2tn (£900bn) in funding for government agencies, including ICE. The measure - which would allocate $64.4bn to DHS, including $10bn for ICE - was approved 220-207. It must still pass the Senate. Democrats who voted in favour said they did so to fund the Transportation Security Administration and Federal Emergency Management Agency, both under DHS.

Trump says Greenland framework includes mineral rights. What minerals does the island have? Donald Trump has made clear he covets Greenland. Now he claims to have secured the "framework" of a future deal, to address defence on the island - a deal that he says includes rights to rare earth minerals. So what natural resources does Greenland have? Greenland is believed to sit on top of large reserves of oil and natural gas. It is also said to be home to the vast majority of raw materials considered crucial for electronics, green energy and other strategic and military technologies – to which Trump has been pushing to secure America's access. Overall, 25 of 34 minerals deemed "critical raw materials" by the European Commission are found in Greenland, including graphite, niobium and titanium, according to the 2023 Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland. Greenland's strategic importance is "not just about defence", Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican from Texas, said at a Senate hearing last year about the potential acquisition of Greenland, pointing to the island's "vast reserves of rare earth elements". Trump has sometimes downplayed the importance of those resources, pointing to what he claims is rising Russian and Chinese influence in the region to justify his claims that the US has to "have" the island. "I want Greenland for security - I don't want it for anything else," he told reporters at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday, pointing in part to the difficulty of exploring in the Arctic region. "You have to go 25ft down through ice to get it. It's not, it's not something that a lot of people are going to do or want to do." But access to the island's natural resources have loomed large in the background for the administration, which has put the US economy at the centre of its geopolitical vision and has made combatting China's dominance of the rare earths industry a priority. Trump's interest in controlling Greenland is "primarily about access to those resources, and blocking China's access", according to Steven Lamy, professor of international relations at the University of Southern California. Even before Trump's second term, the US had been tightening its ties with Greenland, including by reopening its consulate in the island's capital, Nuuk, in 2020, responding to Russia and China's expanding military presence in the Arctic. Since Trump returned to office, his allies have talked up the island's commercial potential, as rising temperatures expand sea routes and opportunities to explore the region's fisheries and other natural resources, especially those related to defence, such as energy and critical minerals, that the administration sees as a priority. "This is about shipping lanes. This is about energy. This is about fisheries. And, of course, it's about your mission, which is keeping us safe and monitoring space, monitoring our adversaries, and making sure the American people can sleep safely in their homes, day in and day out," Mike Waltz, the current US ambassador to the United Nations and then Trump's national security adviser, told US troops stationed in Greenland last year. And Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry told CNBC this month that Trump was a "business president" who believed the island represented "a more robust trading opportunity". Over the summer, the Trump administration signed off on the possibility of backing an American company's mining project in Greenland, via $120m (£90m) in financing from the Export-Import Bank of the United States. The plan built on other deals the Trump administration has agreed with Australia and Japan, as well as private firms, to secure US access to supply and production of rare earths, an industry now dominated by China. Dr Patrick Schröder, a senior research fellow at Chatham House, said the scale of Greenland's critical minerals holdings had the potential to "shift the dial" for the US, allowing it to reduce its reliance on China - a key priority for the administration. But critics of Trump's designs on the island, say it is not clear why US control would be necessary to access the island's resources. Analysts also warn that tapping them is easier said than done. Among other challenges, mining in Greenland currently is expensive and hampered by severe weather conditions, a lack of infrastructure and a small labour force, Lamy said. While exploration permits have been given for 100 blocs of the island, there are just two productive mines in Greenland. "Greenland has been trying to attract outside investments into its extractive industries for a long time, and has not had a lot of luck because the business case just hasn't really been there," said Mikkel Runge Olesen, a senior researcher at the Danish Institute for International Studies. "It's true that there are huge quantities of minerals of various kinds in Greenland. However, it also costs a lot of money to extract those minerals." But Prof Andrew Shepherd, director of the Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling, said rapidly melting layers of ice are increasingly easing the process, exposing rock for potential mining and creating river runoff. "Getting all the fieldwork done traditionally has been very hard to do because you have to get energy to remote regions," he told the BBC. "With the melting ice, you get the potential for hydro power in the area where the land is being exposed… so this presents itself as an interesting prospect." Jennifer Spence, director of the Arctic Initiative at the Harvard Kennedy School, said when it came to mining in Greenland, "it's all still about potential". Still, she thinks the island's strategic shipping location and rare earths deposits were key factors drawing Trump's attention. "His logic is that there's a national security imperative," Spence said. "My belief is that this is much more economically driven." Additional reporting by Natalie Sherman

**Excerpt**

Eight surprise takeaways from the Oscar nominations Awards pundits were taken by surprise from the first two words spoken at the Oscar nominations on Thursday. "Elle Fanning, for Sentimental Value," said hosts Danielle Brooks and Lewis Pullman, as they kicked off the nominations with the best supporting actress category. Fanning's appearance got things off to a spicy start - she had received praise for her performance in the Norwegian family drama, but few had predicted a nomination. The opening category set the tone for a string of snubs and surprises, which started coming thick and fast. Here are eight of the big takeaways. 1. Some hot favourites missed out Although Hamnet and One Battle After Another did well, both had a slightly softer showing than expected in the acting categories. Paul Mescal missed out on a supporting actor nod for Hamnet - a surprising omission, although we're confident it won't have much impact on his co-star Jessie Buckley's frontrunner status for best actress. Meanwhile, four big actors from One Battle After Another were recognised, but its break-out star Chase Infiniti missed best actress despite being a red-hot contender. It was an admittedly competitive category. But at 25 years old and with rave reviews for her performance in the film, we're pretty sure we haven't heard the last of her. Other actors who had momentum but ended up missing included Jesse Plemons for Bugonia and Joel Edgerton for Train Dreams. But both of those movies made it into best picture - so the Academy clearly liked them overall. 2. F1 is a comfort-food movie F1, which stars Brad Pitt as a racing driver brought out of retirement, was the biggest surprise in the best picture category. It wasn't exactly an outsider - many awards pundits expected it to pick up several below-the-line nominations for its impressive technical achievements (we recommend watching the film in a cinema or with surround sound if you can). But the fact that it had enough momentum to propel it into best picture was a real show of strength - especially without other major nominations in best director or the acting categories. It shows the old guard of the Academy still appreciates traditional, well-made films that can simply be enjoyed with a bucket of popcorn. 3. Sinners were the big winners Sinners scored a record-breaking 16 nominations, flying way past the previous joint record holders La La Land, Titanic and All About Eve, which got 14 each. Ryan Coogler's vampire horror has done particularly well to maintain its momentum with voters, considering it was released last spring. But it's exactly the kind of film the Academy would want to recognise. Although vampire movies might not be traditional Oscars bait, Sinners was a real artistic achievement, blending genre horror with 1930s blues music against the backdrop of the Mississippi Delta. Coogler also made headlines in the Hollywood trade publications last year for the deal he negotiated with Warner Brothers, which will see the film's ownership rights return to him after 25 years. 4. Wicked did not bewitch the Academy The first Wicked film received 10 Oscar nominations and went on to win two. So it's an extraordinary fall from grace for its sequel to have got zero. This was largely expected, however. Wicked: For Good was far less well received than its predecessor - something it shares with the original musical. The second act of the stage show is widely considered weaker than the first, partly because all the big hits appear before the interval. But it was still thought that Wicked: For Good could get into a couple of categories, with many predicting a best original song nomination for The Girl in the Bubble, a track performed by Ariana Grande that was newly added for the film adaptation. There was better news for another blockbuster, Avatar: Fire and Ash, which at least managed a couple of technical nominations for visual effects and costume design. Some of the most mainstream films can instead be found in the animated category. That's where we find the $1.7bn-grossing Zootopia 2 (known as Zootropolis 2 in the UK) and viral streaming hit KPop Demon Hunters. 5. The Brits showed up Sinners didn't just score the highest number of nominations, it also delivered the only two Brits to be nominated in the acting categories. Wunmi Mosaku and Delroy Lindo made it into best supporting actress and actor respectively. While Mosaku's nomination was broadly expected, Lindo's was more of a surprise, and his inclusion is perhaps the most telling indicator of how much love there clearly is for Sinners across the Academy. Lindo narrowly missed a best actor nomination a few years ago for Spike Lee's Da 5 Bloods. The 73-year-old's first ever Oscar nomination feels long overdue. 6. Several actresses carried their films to a nomination Three of the actresses nominated on Thursday ended up being the only recognition their film received. Rose Byrne was the sole representation for motherhood drama If I Had Legs I'd Kick You, while Kate Hudson made it in on her own for the touching musical love story Song Sung Blue. Meanwhile, Weapons star Amy Madigan was nominated for her role as an eccentric aunt who shows up in a US town just before the local school children go missing. Madigan's nomination is perhaps the most impressive, given that jump-scare horror movies aren't traditional Oscars fodder. But the 75-year-old was a passion pick for many pundits and voters, and her fans have been campaigning hard for her to be recognised for her memorable (and slightly terrifying) performance. 7. New category is a mixed bag The newly introduced casting category overlapped with many of the general frontrunners, with nominations for Marty Supreme, One Battle After Another, Hamnet, Sinners and The Secret Agent. We can't help but feel slightly bemused, however, that one other film in particular missed out. Sentimental Value failed to score a casting nomination despite all four of its lead stars scoring individual nods - Stellan Skarsgård, Elle Fanning, Renate Reinsve and Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas. If that quartet was impressive enough to be nominated individually, you might've thought there was a good chance of recognition for the casting directors who put them together - Avy Kaufman and Yngvill Kolset Haga. 8. Timothée is even closer to greatness At the SAG Awards last year, Timothée Chalamet spoke about his desire to eventually be considered "one of the Hollywood greats". He's a big step closer to that with the likelihood that he will win his first Oscar this year, as the clear frontrunner in best actor for table-tennis drama Marty Supreme. Although he's only been nominated twice before, Chalamet is popular with the Academy, having starred in a whopping eight best picture-nominated films. He is also the youngest actor since Marlon Brando to receive three nominations for best leading actor. Brando was 30, the same age as Chalamet, when he got his third in 1954. Timothée came close to a win last year for playing Bob Dylan in A Complete Unknown, but we're confident that 2026 will be his time to reign supreme.
