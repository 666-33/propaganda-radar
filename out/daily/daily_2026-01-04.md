Video shows Maduro's arrival in US and journey into custody Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores have been placed in custody at a New York detention centre after he was captured during US strikes on Caracas. Footage shows a handcuffed Maduro emerging from a plane after it landed at Stewart Air National Guard Base in New York state on Saturday evening. He was then taken to the offices of the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). The White House shared a video of him at the office on social media, with the caption: "Perp walked." He was later taken into a helicopter at a New York heliport, which is believed to have transported him and Flores to the Metropolitan Detention Center, a federal facility in Brooklyn where they are being held.
