Bowen: Trump's action could set precedent for authoritarian powers across globe With the seizure of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, Donald Trump has demonstrated more powerfully than ever his belief in the power of his will, backed by raw US military force. On his orders the US has Maduro behind bars and now will "run" Venezuela. The US president made the announcement in a remarkable news conference with enormous implications for US foreign policy worldwide at his Florida club and residence, Mar-a-Lago. Trump said the US would be in charge in Venezuela "until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition". US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, he said, had spoken to the Venezuelan Vice-President Delcy Rodríguez, who had told him "we'll do whatever you need... She, I think, was quite gracious, but she really doesn't have a choice". Trump was light on detail. He said that "we're not afraid of boots on the ground if we have to have [them]". But does he believe that he can govern Venezuela by remote control? Will this demonstration that he will back words with military action, praised lavishly at Mar-a-Lago by both Marco Rubio and the US Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth, be enough to reshape Venezuela and browbeat Latin American leaders into compliance? It sounded as if he believes something like that. The evidence is that it will not be easy or smooth. The respected think tank, the International Crisis Group, warned in October that the fall of Maduro could lead to violence and instability in Venezuela. The same month The New York Times reported that defence and diplomatic officials in the first Trump administration had war-gamed what might happen if Maduro fell. Their conclusion was the prospect of violent chaos as armed factions competed for power. The removal and incarceration of Nicolás Maduro is a remarkable assertion of American military power. The US assembled a massive armada and achieved its goal without losing a single American life. Maduro had ignored the will of the Venezuelan people by sweeping aside his own electoral defeat and, without question, his departure will be welcomed by many of its citizens. But the implications of the US action will reverberate forward, way beyond Venezuela's borders. The mood at the Mar-a-Lago news conference was triumphalist, as they celebrated what was undoubtedly a textbook operation carried out by highly professional US forces. The military operation is only the first stage. America's record of achieving regime change by force in the last 30 years is disastrous. The political follow-up is what makes or breaks the process. Iraq descended into a bloody catastrophe after the US invasion in 2003. In Afghanistan two decades and billions of dollars' worth of attempted nation-building were swept away in days after the US pulled out in 2021. Neither country was in America's backyard. Yet the ghosts of interventions past in Latin America - and the threat of others yet to come - are scarcely more promising. Trump tried out a new nickname, the Donroe Doctrine, for the declaration made by President James Monroe in 1823 warning other powers not to meddle in America's sphere of influence in the Western hemisphere. "The Monroe Doctrine is a big deal, but we've superseded it by a lot," Trump said at Mar-a-Lago. "Under our new national security strategy, American dominance in the Western hemisphere will never be questioned again." He said that the President of Colombia, Gustavo Petro, had to "watch his ass". Later he told Fox News that "something's going to have to be done with Mexico". Cuba is undoubtedly also on the US agenda, which is being driven by Rubio, whose parents are Cuban-Americans. The US has a long record of armed intervention in Latin America. I was in Haiti in 1994 when President Bill Clinton sent in 25,000 troops and two aircraft carriers to enforce regime change. Then, the Haitian regime crumbled without a shot being fired. Far from ushering in a better future, the 30 years since then have been a period of almost unbroken misery for the Haitian people. Haiti is now a failed state dominated by armed gangs. Donald Trump talked of making Venezuela great again, but not about democracy. He dismissed the idea that the Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado, who won the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize, should lead the country. "I think it'd be very tough for her to be the leader, she doesn't have the support... She doesn't have the respect." He did not mention Edmundo González, who many Venezuelans believe was the rightful winner of the 2024 elections. Instead, the US, for the time being anyway, is backing Maduro's Vice-President Delcy Rodríguez. While there must have been some kind of internal collusion that gave the US military the inside knowledge it needed to remove Maduro, the regime created by his predecessor, Hugo Chávez, appears to be intact. It is unlikely that the Venezuelan armed forces, despite any humiliation its generals might feel about their inability to oppose the US attack, will acquiesce with US plans. The military and the regime's civilian supporters have enriched themselves through networks of corruption that they will not want to lose. Civilian militias have been armed by the regime, and Venezuela has other armed groups. They include criminal networks, as well as Colombian guerrillas who backed the Maduro regime in return for sanctuary. The US intervention in Venezuela brings into stark focus some of the well springs of Trump's worldview. He makes no secret of the way he covets the mineral wealth of other countries. He has already attempted to extract profit from Ukraine's natural resources in return for military assistance. Trump does not hide his desire to control Venezuela's huge mineral reserves, and his belief that US oil companies were robbed when the oil industry was nationalised. "We're going to be taking out a tremendous amount of wealth out of the ground, and that wealth is going to the people of Venezuela, and people from outside of Venezuela that used to be in Venezuela, and it goes also to the United States of America in the form of reimbursement." That will deepen the fears in Greenland and Denmark that he will look north as well as south. The US has not dropped its desire to absorb Greenland, for its strategic position in the Arctic as well as the natural resources that are becoming more accessible as its ice melts due to global warming. The Maduro operation also amounts to another serious blow to the idea that the best way to run the world is to follow an agreed set of rules, as laid out in international law. The idea was tattered before Donald Trump took office, but he has already demonstrated repeatedly both in the US and internationally that he believes he can ignore laws he doesn't like. European allies, who are desperate not to anger him, including Prime Minister Keir Starmer, are wrestling with ways to say that they support the idea of international law without condemning the fact that the Maduro operation is a blatant violation of the Charter of the United Nations. The US justification that its military was simply aiding the execution of an arrest warrant for a drug lord masquerading as Venezuela's president is thin, especially given Trump's declarations that the US will now control the country and its oil industry. A few hours before Maduro and his wife were seized, he met Chinese diplomats at his palace in Caracas. China condemned the US action. It said "hegemonic acts of the US seriously violate international law and Venezuela's sovereignty and threaten peace and security in Latin America and the Caribbean region". The US should "stop violating other countries' sovereignty and security". Even so, China might see a precedent set by the US action. It regards Taiwan as a breakaway province and has declared that returning it to control of Beijing is a national priority. In Washington, that is certainly the fear of the Democratic vice-chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Senator Mark Warner. He issued a statement saying China's leaders, and others, will be watching closely. "If the United States asserts the right to use military force to invade and capture foreign leaders it accuses of criminal conduct, what prevents China from claiming the same authority over Taiwan's leadership? What stops [Russian President] Vladimir Putin from asserting similar justification to abduct Ukraine's president? Once this line is crossed, the rules that restrain global chaos begin to collapse, and authoritarian regimes will be the first to exploit it." Donald Trump seems to believe that he makes the rules, and what applies to the US under his command does not mean others can expect the same privileges. But that is not how the world of power works. His actions at the start of 2026 point to another 12 months of global turbulence.

From Caracas 'fort' to New York court: Maduro's capture in pictures and maps The US says its military operation to capture Venezuela's president took months of planning, but when Donald Trump gave the order to launch, "Operation Absolute Resolve" only lasted about 150 minutes. The surprise early-morning attack on Saturday marked an unprecedented event in modern politics and culminated in the arrest of Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores. Captured by troops from an elite US army unit as they tried to flee into a fortified safe room, the pair are now being held in a detention centre in New York and face narco-terrorism charges. As the sun rose on Saturday, the scale of the military operation in Caracas, Venezuela's capital, was clear. Pictures from Fuerte Tiuna, a huge military complex where top government officials live, show bombed out buildings and charred, smouldering cars. It was at this compound that Maduro and his wife were captured, Venezuelan ruling party leader Nahum Fernández told the Associated Press news agency. Hours earlier - Trump gives the order Operation Absolute Resolve began with reports of explosions at about 02:00 in Caracas (06:00 GMT). The US cut power to the city, Trump has since said, describing it as "dark and deadly". The aim was to disable Venezuela's air defences and clear the path for US military helicopters to get to Fuerte Tiuna. "We assessed that we had maintained totally the element of surprise", Gen Dan Caine, the nation's highest-ranking military officer, said. The BBC has verified five strike locations, including the compound, a port and an airport. Pictures show Fuerte Tiuna on fire, with huge flames visible for miles. Venezuelans have described how US military helicopters flew low over Caracas, heading for Fuerte Tiuna. Some of the helicopters came under fire, but were still able to fly, Gen Caine said. "It was a lot of gunfire," Trump added. Once on the ground, troops from the US Army's Delta Force, an elite special forces unit, moved quickly. They gained access to the compound at 02:01 local time, and the Maduros "gave up" without a struggle, Gen Caine said. But Trump gave more details. The Maduros tried to escape into a safe place, the US president explained, describing it as a military "fortress". "The safe place is all steel, and he wasn't able to make it to the door because our guys were so fast. "It was a very thick door, a very heavy door," Trump told reporters. "He made it to the door. He was unable to close it." But even if they had managed to get into the safe room, Trump said troops could have blown it open in about "47 seconds". From Caracas to Manhattan Now in US custody, Nicolás Maduro and his wife were transported some 2,100 miles (3,400km), to New York City. They were flown out of Caracas by helicopter, and taken to the USS Iwo Jima, a warship stationed in the Caribbean. The team was back "over the water" by 04:29, Gen Caine said. It was on the ship that we got one of the defining pictures of the whole operation - Maduro in handcuffs, wearing ear protectors and a type of blindfold that looked like dark sunglasses. From the USS Iwo Jima, he was first flown to the US Navy base at Guantánamo Bay. The Maduros were then flown on a government plane to Stewart Air National Guard Base in New York state, and then via helicopter to Manhattan. On Saturday, a video was released showing Maduro at the Drug Enforcement Agency's (DEA) headquarters in New York. He and Cilia Flores are now being held in a detention centre in the city. They have been charged with conspiracy to commit narco-terrorism and import cocaine, possession of machine guns and destructive devices, and conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices against the US. "They will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts," said Attorney General Pam Bondi.

At least 30 killed in attack on Nigeria village Armed men have violently stormed a village in Nigeria's Niger state, killing at least 30 people and looting shops, state authorities have said. The attackers emerged from a forest near the village of Kasuwan-Daji on Saturday and set fire to the local market, looted shops and kidnapped an unspecified number of people, police said. "The gunmen entered the town on motorcycles carrying weapons, rounded up people and then proceeded to slaughter them, while others were shot dead," a local journalist told the BBC's Hausa service. Attacks and kidnappings by armed criminal gangs, known as bandits, have been a problem in Nigeria for years, but reports in western and central regions have spiked recently. Abdullahi Rofia, an official with the Niger State Emergency Management Agency, confirmed the journalist's report that villagers were rounded up and killed. He told the BBC that people in the community were terrified: "They are hiding, they are too afraid to talk to anybody. "They are scared that if you talk, they will turn and do the same to you." Niger state police spokesperson, Wasiu Abiodun, said an emergency team has been deployed to help the injured and security forces are working to rescue those kidnapped. It is illegal to pay ransom money to the criminal groups, which the government has classified as terrorists, but there are claims this is often ignored. A witness to the attack told BBC Hausa that there were no security forces in the village. "We want the government to help us. In the past, we used to hear about this problem in other places, but now it is happening in our villages," he said. The fear is driving people from their homes where they were born and raised. "We are dying like chickens, and does the government care about us? "The government hears and sees what is happening, but it is not doing anything about it. What can we do as ordinary people?" The attack happened just a day after authorities in Niger state announced the phased reopening of schools, after a mass kidnapping forced them to close as part of emergency security measures. In November, more than 250 students and staff from St Mary's Catholic school in Papiri, Niger state, were abducted. It was one of the country's worst kidnappings to date, however just before Christmas, officials confirmed that all of the missing students and teachers had been rescued.

Thousands stranded across Europe as Greece airspace disrupted Thousands of passengers are stranded across Europe after a communications failure forced Greece to close its airspace, causing widespread cancellations and delays. Officials are working to understand why radio communications were disrupted on Sunday morning, prompting the temporary suspension of arrivals and departures. Some departures have since been allowed to resume - though inbound flights are still being told to divert or return to their point of origin. Athens' main airport is among the worst affected, while Thessaloniki airport has closed entirely. The timing of the disruption has raised fears that travellers will not be able to get home before the start of the working week. "I was supposed to fly to London, via Stockholm, with SAS," one passenger at Athens International Airport told Greek broadcaster Mega TV. "I'm working on Newport Hospital tomorrow morning. I'm not going to be there on time, I don't know what else to say. "Who is going to pay for the additional cost this travel will cost me? We still don't know if and when we're going to leave, no one is telling us anything." More than 90 flights have been affected in and out of Athens airport alone - though some flights have since been able to resume. A member of staff in the airport told the BBC that 35 aircraft an hour were now being allowed to take off, but it was still unable to take inbound flights. Flights departing from Dublin, Barcelona and Paris were earlier ordered to return to their airports of origin, while services from Copenhagen and Malta were cancelled altogether. Other arrivals into Athens were placed on standby, while flights in and out of other Greek airports have also been affected. Three flights out of Heraklion airport on the island of Crete, including one to Munich, have been delayed, according to public broadcaster ERT. Most inbound flights are being diverted to Turkey if not cancelled outright, it reports. The disruption comes at a busy time for air travel in and out of Athens, which typically sees more than 600 scheduled flights per day, as people return from winter holidays. In the chaos, some passengers have complained of a lack of information. One told news site Flash: "We have no updates. They told us that we will be able to leave but I don't think this is true. On the departures board I can't see my flight, and I'm supposed to leave shortly." Another, who had been on a flight to Rhodes when it turned around and headed back to Athens, told news agency Reuters: "From that moment until now we have no information whatsoever." Domestic travellers may have the option of getting home on Greece's rail network, but this would take significantly longer. The issue that caused the disruption is thought to concern the radio system used by air traffic controllers to communicate with planes in their airspace. Panagiotis Psarros, chair of the Association of Greek Air Traffic Controllers, told ERT that all frequencies were "suddenly lost", adding: "We could not communicate with aircraft in the sky." The broadcaster later reported than an initial investigation by the Greek security services suggested the problem may be due to the failure of an antenna in the Gerania Mountains near Athens. Italy, Turkey and Cyprus are assisting Greece in managing the situation.

**Excerpt**

Danish PM tells Trump to stop 'threats' against Greenland Denmark's prime minister has told Donald Trump to "stop the threats" about taking over Greenland. Mette Frederiksen said "it makes absolutely no sense to talk about the need for the United States to take over Greenland", adding: "The US has no right to annex any of the three nations in the Danish kingdom". Her remarks come after Katie Miller - the wife of one of Trump's aides, Stephen Miller - tweeted a map of Greenland in the colours of the American flag alongside the word "SOON". Trump has repeatedly raised the possibility of Greenland becoming an annexed part of the US, citing its strategic location and mineral wealth. In her statement, posted on the Danish government website, Frederiksen said she was addressing the US "very directly". She said Denmark - "and thus Greenland" - was a Nato member and covered by the alliance's security guarantee. Denmark already had a defence agreement with the US that gave it access to Greenland, she said, and Denmark had upped its investment in security in the Arctic region. "I would therefore strongly urge the United States to stop the threats against a historically close ally and against another country and another people who have very clearly said that they are not for sale," she said. Earlier the Danish ambassador to the US responded to the post by Ms Miller - a right-wing podcaster and former aide to Trump during his first term - with a "friendly reminder" that the two countries were allies and saying Denmark expected respect for its territorial integrity. The exchange comes after the US carried out a major military operation against Venezuela on Saturday, capturing its president Nicolas Maduro and his wife and removing them to New York. Trump later said the US would "run" Venezuela and US oil companies would "start making money for the country". The US president has previously refused to rule out using force to secure control of Greenland, a vast island in the Arctic. Trump has claimed that making it part of the United States would serve US security interests due to its strategic location and its abundance of minerals critical to high-tech sectors. The Trump administration's recent move to appoint a special envoy to Greenland prompted anger in Denmark. Greenland, which has a population of 57,000 people, has had extensive self-government since 1979, though defence and foreign policy remain in Danish hands. While most Greenlanders favour eventual independence from Denmark, opinion polls show overwhelming opposition to becoming part of the US.

'Deeply shocked': World leaders react to US attack on Venezuela Leaders around the world have responded with a mix of condemnation and support to the US capture of Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro. Following a large-scale strike on Venezuela on Saturday, Maduro and his wife were captured by US forces and removed from the country. The pair have been indicted on drug charges in New York. In an initial response, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said his government would "shed no tears" for the end of Maduro's regime. Neighbouring Latin American countries condemned the actions, as did Venezuela's long-term allies, Russia and China. China said it was "deeply shocked and strongly condemns" the use of force against a sovereign country and its president. Russia accused the US of committing "an act of armed aggression". Iran, which is locked in its own dispute with Trump over his promise of intervention in its country, called the strikes a "flagrant violation of the country's national sovereignty". Trump said the US will "run" Venezuela "until we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition". Many Latin American leaders condemned the US actions. Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula Da Silva wrote on X that the actions "cross an unacceptable line", adding that "attacking countries in flagrant violation of international law is the first step toward a world of violence, chaos, and instability". Colombian President Gustavo Petro called the strikes an "assault on the sovereignty" of Latin America, while Chile's President Gabriel Boric expressed "concern and condemnation" and called for "a peaceful solution to the serious crisis affecting the country". Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel accused the US of a "criminal attack", while Uruguay said in an official statement that it was monitoring developments "with attention and serious concern" and "rejects, as it always has, military intervention". Trump has indicated that Cuba could become part of a broader US policy in the region, calling it a failing nation. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Cuba was a disaster run by incompetent leaders who supported Maduro's administration and that the government in Havana should be concerned. The Venezuelan Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello urged citizens to remain calm and to trust the country's leadership and military, saying "the world needs to speak out about this attack" according to news agency Reuters. But Argentinian President Javier Milei – who Trump has described as his "favourite president" – wrote "freedom moves forward" and "long live freedom" on social media. Meanwhile, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer refused to be drawn into whether or not the military action may have broken international law. He did not condemn the US strikes in an interview with the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme on Saturday morning He said he was waiting to establish all the facts but would not "shy away from this", adding he was a "lifelong advocate of international law". The UK was not involved in the strikes and Sir Keir said he had not spoken to Trump about the operation. Later on Saturday, he posted on X that the UK "regarded Maduro as an illegitimate president and we shed no tears about the end of his regime". "The UK government will discuss the evolving situation with US counterparts in the days ahead as we seek a safe and peaceful transition to a legitimate government that reflects the will of the Venezuelan people," he added. The EU's top diplomat Kaja Kallas reiterated the bloc's position that Maduro lacks legitimacy, that there should be a peaceful transition of power, and that the principles of international law must be respected. French President Emmanuel Macron said the transition of power "must be peaceful, democratic, and respectful of the will of the Venezuelan people" in a post on X. He added he hoped González - the opposition's 2024 presidential candidate - could ensure the transition. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said the legality of the US operation was "complex" and international law in general must apply. He warned that "political instability must not be allowed to arise in Venezuela". UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he was "deeply concerned that the rules of international law have not been respected", his spokesperson said. He was "deeply alarmed" by the strikes, which set a "dangerous precedent". In the US, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, said: "Let me be clear, Maduro is an illegitimate dictator, but launching military action without congressional authorisation, without a federal plan for what comes next, is reckless." Elsewhere, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, a staunch US ally, congratulated Trump on his "bold and historic leadership on behalf of freedom and justice". Canada's Foreign Minister Anita Anand said "Canada calls on all parties to respect international law and we stand by the people of Venezuela and their desire to live in a peaceful and democratic society". Canada was engaging with international partners, she said. Norway's Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said "international law is universal and binding for all states. "The American intervention in Venezuela is not in accordance with international law."

**Excerpt**

Who is Cilia Flores, Venezuela's first lady captured by the US? When US forces conducted a night raid on the Venezuelan capital Caracas, they didn't just drag President Nicolás Maduro from his compound and put him on a boat to New York - they took his wife too. Cilia Flores, 69, has long been seen as one of the most powerful figures in Venezuela, a political operator in her own right who for decades has shaped the country's fortunes. After years leading Venezuela's National Assembly, she helped consolidate her husband's grip on power after his 2013 presidential election victory. As First Lady, she was dubbed "First Warrior" by Maduro. But in that role she publicly took a backseat - presenting a more family-oriented face to what critics say was a brutal regime. She hosted a TV show, Con Cilia en Familia, and made occasional appearances on state television to dance salsa with her husband. But behind-the-scenes, she is thought to have been one of Maduro's key advisers, and an architect of his political survival. Flores has faced allegations of corruption and nepotism, and in recent years her family members have been found guilty in US courts of cocaine smuggling. She will now face drug trafficking and weapons charges in a New York court, along with her husband. Flores met Maduro in the early 1990s, when - as a young up-and-coming lawyer - she took on the defence of the plotters of the failed 1992 coup attempt. Chief among them: Hugo Chávez, the man who would later become president. It was during those years that she met Maduro, who at the time was working for Chávez as a security guard. "I met Cilia in life," Maduro recounted. "She was the lawyer for several imprisoned patriotic military officers. But she was also Commander Chávez's lawyer and, well, being Commander Chávez's lawyer in prison... tough." "I met her during those years of struggle, and then, well, she caught my eye." From then, both their fates became linked to Chávez and his political movement, known as Chavismo. After Chávez won the presidency in 1998, Flores quickly rose through the political ranks, joining the National Assembly in 2000 and becoming its leader in 2006. For six years she led a virtually one-party parliament, with the main opposition parties refusing to participate in elections, saying they were not free and fair. When Chávez died in 2013, Flores threw her weight behind Maduro, who narrowly won the subsequent presidential election. Months later the pair married, formalising a years-long relationship in which they'd lived together, raising children from previous relationships: three of hers and one of his. "She became a critical piece in Maduro's regime," said José Enrique Arrioja, a Venezuelan journalist and managing editor of Americas Quarterly. "She was not only the emotional confidant of Maduro, but the professional confidant too. And she was very power-driven." Across her career, she has faced numerous allegations of corruption. In 2012, she was accused by unions of nepotism for influencing the hiring of up to 40 people, including numerous members of her family. "My family came here and I am very proud that they are my family. I will defend them," she responded. In November 2015, she became embroiled in the "Narco nephews" case, when two of her nephews - Francisco Flores de Freitas and Efrain Antonio Campo Flores - were arrested in Haiti in a sting operation by the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). They were caught trying to smuggle 800kg of cocaine into the US. Flores accused US authorities of having "kidnapped" her nephews - but a judge sentenced the two men to 18 years in prison for drug trafficking. They were returned to Venezuela in 2022 as part of a prisoner swap under the Biden administration. But last month, the Trump administration announced fresh sanctions on the two nephews - as well as a third nephew, Carlos Erik Malpica Flores - with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent saying: "Nicolás Maduro and his criminal associates in Venezuela are flooding the United States with drugs that are poisoning the American people." "Treasury is holding the regime and its circle of cronies and companies accountable for its continued crimes," he added. The newly unsealed indictment against Flores accuses her - among other things - of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes in 2007 to arrange a meeting between "a large-scale drug trafficker" and the director of Venezuela's National Anti-Drug Office. "To her detractors, she is seen as part of a deeply corrupt, human-rights-abusing and brutal government," says Christopher Sabatini, Senior Fellow and Chatham House's Latin America programme. "She was a power behind the throne," he adds. "But like any good power behind the throne, you really didn't see her hand that much, so no one really knew how powerful she was." She is expected in court on Monday. Additional reporting by BBC Mundo

Brigitte Bardot Foundation issues warning about scam memorabilia The charity Brigitte Bardot established has issued a warning about "scam" merchandise purporting to fund its work following the French actress's death. The Brigitte Bardot Foundation said it was aware of "crude fabrications" being advertised online alongside claims the proceeds will go to the animal welfare charity. It threatened to take legal action against anyone taking part in "these alleged illegal fundraising efforts", stating: "Everyone is asked to respect the memory of the deceased." Bardot died aged 91 last Sunday. After revolutionising 1950s French cinema and becoming a symbol of sexual liberation, she quit acting to devote her life to animals. But the actress-turned-activist courted controversy later in life over a string of remarks about Muslims, gay people and the #MeToo movement. She was fined five times for inciting racial hatred. Her death prompted tributes in France, with President Emmanuel Macron saying the nation was mourning "a legend of the century". "Her films, her voice, her dazzling glory, her initials, her sorrows, her generous passion for animals, her face that became Marianne, Brigitte Bardot embodied a life of freedom," he said. But now, online scammers were co-opting her iconic image for "vulgar and despicable attempts to exploit her legacy", the Brigitte Bardot Foundation said. It warned of "the spread on the internet and social networks of offers for sale of photographs, AI-assisted montages, and all kinds of media" reproducing her image, including "in fabricated situations". "These are crude fabrications, illicit offers and sales, and purported fundraising campaigns that have never received any endorsement from the Brigitte Bardot Foundation, which cannot condone these scams," it wrote in a statement on Saturday. Bardot starred in nearly 50 films including And God Created Woman and Contempt, setting fashion trends with her tousled blonde hair and bold eyeliner, before becoming the model for Marianne, the personified symbol of France. She retired from acting in 1973, aged 39, declaring: "I gave my youth and beauty to men, I give my wisdom and experience to animals." Bardot would go on to launch her animal rights foundation 13 years later. Her funeral will take place on Wednesday in Saint-Tropez, southern France, where she lived for decades, in a cemetery overlooking her home and the Mediterranean. The Brigitte Bardot Foundation told French news agency AFP that the private burial will be "no frills" and "without fuss", in keeping with her spirit.

Can Maduro's trusted lieutenant now work for Trump? Many of those who tuned in to US President Donald Trump's news conference on Saturday were probably hoping to hear dramatic details of how US forces seized Venezuela's leader, Nicolás Maduro, in a pre-dawn raid. But arguably a more surprising moment came when Trump announced that now that Maduro was in custody, the US would "run" Venezuela "until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition". In another unexpected development, he added that Secretary of State Marco Rubio had been speaking to Maduro's Vice-President, Delcy Rodríguez, who he said was "essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again". However, Rodríguez seemed less than co-operative in her own news conference later where she denounced Maduro's detention as a kidnapping and stressed that Venezuela would not become a colony. Given these conflicting messages, many are asking who is now in charge in Venezuela. Under Venezuela constitution, it falls to the vice-president to take over should the president be absent. So, on the face of it, the Venezuelan Supreme Court ruling that Delcy Rodríguez was the country's acting president seems like a logical step. But most Venezuela watchers had expected the immediate aftermath of a US intervention to look differently. The US - and many other nations - did not recognise Nicolás Maduro as Venezuela's legitimate president, having denounced the 2024 election as rigged. Maduro was declared president by Venezuela's electoral council (CNE), a body dominated by government loyalists. But the CNE never produced the detailed voting tallies to back up their claim and copies of voting tallies collected by the opposition and reviewed by the Carter Center suggested that the opposition candidate, Edmundo González, had won by a landslide. In view of that, the US and dozens of other countries recognised González as the president-elect. González, a little-known former diplomat, had the backing of popular opposition leader María Corina Machado, whom he replaced on the ballot after she was barred from running for office by officials from the Maduro government. With the security forces cracking down on the opposition in the aftermath of the election, González went into exile in Spain and Machado into hiding in Venezuela. For the past 18 months, they have been urging Maduro to step down and lobbying for international support for their cause, especially from the US. Machado's profile was boosted by her winning the Nobel Peace Prize for "her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy" in Venezuela. Following the publicity and recognition she received after embarking on a risky journey from her hiding place in Venezuela to Oslo to accept the award, many assumed that any post-Maduro scenario would see her returning to her homeland to take up the reins of power together with Edmundo González. Machado herself posted a letter on social media following Maduro's capture declaring that the "hour of freedom has arrived". "Today we are ready to enforce our mandate and take power," she wrote. But the US president stunned journalists when he declared that Machado did not have the "support or respect" to lead the country. Trump said that his team had not spoken to Machado following the US strikes, but Marco Rubio had spoken to Delcy Rodríguez. Trump's next remark may provide the answer as to why the Trump administration is now Maduro's loyal lieutenant - at least for now. Trump quoted Rodríguez as saying "we'll do whatever you want", adding "she really doesn't have a choice". With Maduro's inner circle still seemingly in power in Venezuela, US officials may have considered that the smoothest transition would be provided by having someone from the existing government take over. In his news conference, President Trump said that the US was "ready to stage a second and much larger attack if we need to do so", which appears to explain why he thinks that Delcy Rodríguez has no choice but to do the US's bidding. The fact that Rodríguez was seen surrounded by some of the most powerful men in Maduro's inner circle hours after the president had been arrested and flown out of the country seems to suggest that she has won their backing, too. Flanking her were her brother Jorge Rodríguez, who is the president of Venezuela's National Assembly, Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello, Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino and the top commander of the armed forces, Domingo Hernández Lárez, among others. This will have pleased US officials concerned that the capture of Maduro would lead to a potentially destabilising battle for control among his inner circle. But the message Delcy Rodríguez had for the US would have been less pleasing to US ears. She insisted that "there is only one president in Venezuela, and his name is Nicolás Maduro" and called his seizure "a kidnapping". "We will never again be a colony of any empire," she insisted, promising to "defend" Venezuela. While she certainly did not sound like the person Trump had described as "willing to do the US's bidding", there has been speculation that she may have struck a nationalistic note to keep Maduro's most loyal supporters on board. Quizzed about Trump's support for Rodríguez and her remarks, Marco Rubio told CBS on Sunday that the US would make an assessment based on her actions, not her words. "Do I know what decisions people are going to make? I don't," he added, seemingly implying that he was not as certain of Rodríguez's willingness to work with the US as Trump. What he was adamant about was the US's willingness to pressure Rodríguez's interim government. "I do know this, that if they don't make the right decisions, the United States will retain multiple levers of leverage to ensure that our interests are protected, and that includes the oil quarantine that's in place, among other things," he said. In an interview with ABC, Rubio also appeared to suggest that fresh elections should be held in Venezuela. "Government will come about through a period of transition and real elections, which they have not had," he told This Week. He also appealed for "realism", suggesting that fresh elections would take time: "Everyone's asking, why 24 hours after Nicolas Maduro was arrested, there isn't an election scheduled for tomorrow? That's absurd." Talk of fresh elections will no doubt disappoint not only María Corina Machado and Edmundo González but also many of the Venezuelans who voted for them and who have been adamant that they want to see those votes honoured. The opposition has long insisted that free and fair elections are not possible while the key institutions involved in organising them are stacked with Maduro loyalists. A reform of those bodies will take time. In the short term, therefore, Venezuela looks likely to be governed by Delcy Rodríguez and Maduro's inner circle - as long as they meet the Trump administration's expectations. How long that may last will depend on whether Rodríguez can find a golden middle between accommodating Trump's requests and the Maduro base interests. She may soon find herself between a rock and a hard place.

**Excerpt**

Raw emotions as mourners attend Mass for Swiss bar fire victims In the snow-dusted street outside St Christopher's Church, hundreds joined a special Sunday Mass for the victims of the fire that tore through Le Constellation bar on New Year's Eve. Many hugged each other, crying quietly, as they remembered the dozens killed and those still in hospital with severe burns, fighting for their lives. During the service, several in the crowd fainted and fell to the ground, overcome. All 40 of the dead have now been identified, although not named publicly. Their bodies are being returned to their families, some of whom who had been holding on to the hope their children might yet be found - injured, but alive. They're now receiving the worst possible news. Ever since the fire, Laetitia Brodard had been posting pictures of her teenage son Arthur online and appealing for help to find him. On Sunday, she was at the memorial service, being comforted by friends. "He died that first day," Laetitia confirmed to me. In an emotional statement on Facebook, she said that Arthur had "gone to party in paradise". The victims' bodies were so badly burned by the fire they are difficult to identify. Even some of those injured and in hospitals haven't been named yet - they remain unconscious and unrecognisable. For the dead, forensics experts are having to use DNA samples and dental records, and for the families the wait is agonising. The bar was packed full of young people that night, many of them just teenagers. The drinking age in Switzerland is 16. Some of the survivors joined a silent procession after the Sunday Mass from the church towards the bar itself. Above, in the stunningly beautiful Swiss Alps, cable cars went on sliding up the mountain carrying tourists to ski. The site of the fire is still screened off behind white plastic sheets, but in front of it are heaps of flowers and soft toys at a shrine that keeps growing. Among the bouquets, there are handwritten notes with names and photographs. At one point, the crowd burst into applause: a large group of firefighters and rescue workers in uniform had reached the memorial and stood arm in arm, sobbing for those they couldn't save. For the people of Crans, they are heroes. The local fire commander - who considered leaving his job after what he experienced here - told us he and his colleagues were now a giant family. "I need them, and they need me," David Vocat said, very tearful. "All my thoughts are for the victims and their families. I am so sorry." We've spoken to teenagers who saw people running from the burning bar and describe horrific scenes they say they can never forget. A criminal investigation has now been opened. The bar owners, a French couple, are suspected of killing and causing arson and bodily harm through negligence. Police and prosecutors have been examining images filmed inside Le Constellation that show the moment the fire started, with bar staff carried on others' shoulders, delivering champagne bottles with sparklers attached. The sparks appear to set fire to the ceiling, which was covered with foam for soundproofing, and the flames spread very quickly. Investigators will examine whether the foam and other materials met safety standards. They will look into possible overcrowding, access to emergency exits from the basement and whether there were fire extinguishers. Some videos show teenagers trying, hopelessly, to put the fire out with their T-shirts. Initially, many didn't realise the immense danger and went on dancing and even filming the fire, instead of fleeing. On Sunday, a group of men - some with their faces covered in black scarves - formed a semi-circle to remember one man killed at the bar which locals call "Stefi". "We're here for our colleague," one of them said, struggling to speak. "Stefi was his final path. May he now rest in peace." "It was important to be here, with the families. We can't change things, we can only be here," Diana said, after praying hand-in-hand with two other women for a group of friends who are still in hospital. "We only hope they make it." "We are not angry," Diana told me. "But we believe the police will do their work well and we hope there is justice."

Spies, drones and blowtorches: How the US captured Maduro For months, US spies had been monitoring Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's every move. A small team, including one source within the Venezuelan government, had been observing where the 63-year-old slept, what he ate, what he wore and even, according to top military officials, "his pets". Then, in early December, a planned mission dubbed "Operation Absolute Resolve" was finalised. It was the result of months of meticulous planning and rehearsals, which even included elite US troops creating an exact full-size replica of Maduro's Caracas safe house to practise their entry routes. The plan - which amounted to an extraordinary US military intervention in Latin America not seen since the Cold War - was closely guarded. Congress was not informed or consulted ahead of time. With the precise details set, top military officials simply had to wait for the optimal conditions to launch. They wanted to maximise the element of surprise, officials said on Saturday. There was a false start four days earlier when US President Donald Trump gave approval, but they opted to wait for better weather and less cloud cover. "Over the weeks through Christmas and New Year, the men and women of the United States military sat ready, patiently waiting for the right triggers to be met and the president to order us into action," General Dan Caine, the nation's highest-ranking military officer, told a news conference on Saturday morning. 'Good luck and godspeed' The order from the president to begin the mission finally came at 22:46 EST on Friday (03:46 GMT on Saturday). "We were going to do this four days ago, three days ago, two days ago, and then all of a sudden it opened up. And we said: go," Trump himself told Fox & Friends on Saturday, hours after the overnight raid. "He said to us, and we appreciate it... good luck and godspeed," Gen Caine said. Trump's order came shortly before midnight in Caracas, giving the military most of the night to operate in darkness. What followed was a two-hour-and-twenty-minute mission by air, land and sea that stunned many in Washington and around the world. In terms of scale and precision, it was virtually unprecedented. And it drew immediate condemnation from several regional powers, with Brazil's President Lula da Silva saying the violent capture of Venezuela's leader set "yet another extremely dangerous precedent for the entire international community". Trump did not follow the mission from the White House situation room. Instead, he was surrounded by his advisers at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, where he watched a live stream of the operation flanked by CIA Director John Ratcliffe and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. "It was an incredible thing to see," Trump said on Saturday. "If you would have seen what happened, I mean, I watched it literally like I was watching a television show. And if you would've seen the speed, the violence... it's just, it was an amazing thing, an amazing job that these people did." In recent months, thousands of US troops have deployed to the region, joining an aircraft carrier and dozens of warships in the largest military build-up in decades as Trump has accused Maduro of drug-trafficking and narco-terrorism, and blown up dozens of small boats accused of ferrying drugs through the region. But the first signs of Operation Absolute Resolve were in the skies. More than 150 aircraft - including bombers, fighter jets and reconnaissance planes - were ultimately deployed through the course of the night, according to US officials. "It was very complex, extremely complex, the whole manoeuvre, the landings, the number of aircraft," Trump told Fox News. "We had a fighter jet for every possible situation." Loud explosions were heard in Caracas at about 02:00 local time (06:00 GMT), and plumes of smoke were seen rising over the city. "I heard a huge sound, a loud bang," reporter Ana Vanessa Herrero told the BBC. "It moved all the windows. Immediately after I saw a huge cloud of smoke that almost blocked the entire view." She added: "Planes and helicopters were flying all over the city." Soon, videos showing numerous aircraft in the skies - and others showing the apparent aftermath of explosions - began to circulate widely on social media. One showed a convoy of helicopters flying at low altitude over Caracas as smoke rose from apparent detonations. "We woke up at around 01:55 to the roar of explosions and the hum of planes flying over Caracas," one witness, Daniela, told the BBC. "Everything was plunged into absolute darkness, illuminated only by the flashes of nearby detonations." She added: "Neighbours were messaging in the condominium group chat, all confused and unaware of what was happening [and] frightened by the blasts." BBC Verify has examined a number of videos showing explosions, fire and smoke in locations around Caracas to identify exactly which sites were targeted. So far, it has confirmed five locations including Generalissimo Francisco de Miranda Air Base, an airfield known as La Carlota and Port La Guaira, Caracas' main conduit to the Caribbean Sea. Some of the US strikes targeted air defence systems and other military targets, officials said. Trump also suggested the US cut the power in Caracas before the mission began, though he did not specify how. "The lights of Caracas were largely turned off due to a certain expertise that we have," he said. "It was dark and it was deadly." 'They knew we were coming' As strikes rang out around Caracas, US forces made their way into the city. They included members of the elite Delta Force, the US military's top special mission unit, sources told the BBC's US news partner CBS. They were heavily armed - and carried a blowtorch in case they had to cut through the metal doors of Maduro's safe house. The troops arrived at Maduro's location shortly after the strikes began at 02:01 local time, according to Gen Caine. Trump described the safe house as a military "fortress" in the heart of Caracas, saying: "They were in a ready position waiting for us. They knew we were coming." The troops took fire when they arrived, and one of the US helicopters was hit but was still able to fly. "The apprehension force descended into Maduro's compound and moved with speed, precision and discipline," Gen Caine said. "They just broke in, and they broke into places that were not really able to be broken into, you know, steel doors that were put there for just this reason," Trump remarked. It was only as the operation - which also saw Maduro's wife, Cilia Flores, seized - was unfolding that Rubio began notifying lawmakers about the action, a decision which has since prompted anger from some in the US Congress. "Let me be clear: Nicolas Maduro is an illegitimate dictator. But launching military action without congressional authorisation and without a credible plan for what comes next is reckless," said top Democrat Chuck Schumer, the party's leader in the Senate. Briefing Congress ahead of time would have endangered the mission, Rubio told reporters during the news conference on Saturday. "Congress has a tendency to leak," Trump added. "This would not be good." In Maduro's compound, as elite US troops flooded in, Trump said the Venezuelan president - who has reportedly increased his reliance on Cuban bodyguards in recent months - attempted to flee to a safe room. "He was trying to get to a safe place, which wasn't safe, because we would have had the door blown up in about 47 seconds," Trump said. "He made it to the door. He was unable to close it. He got bum rushed so fast that he didn't get into that [room]." When asked if the US could have killed Maduro, an authoritarian leader who took over the presidency in 2013, if he had resisted arrest, Trump said: "It could have happened." On the US side, "a couple of guys were hit", he said, but no US service members were killed. In a statement on Sunday, Venezuelan Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino said a "large part" of Maduro's security team and "soldiers and innocent civilians" were killed in the US operation. The US had previously offered a $50m (£37m) reward for information leading to Maduro's arrest. But by 04:20 local time on Saturday, helicopters were leaving Venezuelan territory with Maduro and his wife on board, in custody of the US Department of Justice and en route ultimately to New York, where they are expected to face criminal charges. Almost exactly an hour later Trump announced the news of his capture to the world. "Maduro and his wife will soon face the full might of American justice," he said.
