Changes to Elon Musk's AI Grok 'insulting' to victims, says No 10 The UK government says Elon Musk's platform X limiting Grok AI image edits to paid users is "insulting" to victims of misogyny and sexual violence. Speaking on Friday, Downing Street said the move "simply turns an AI feature that allows the creation of unlawful images into a premium service". It follows significant backlash after Grok digitally altered images of others by undressing them - something it says it now can only do for those who pay a monthly fee. But the prime minister's official spokesperson told reporters on Friday it showed X - which has not yet commented - "can move swiftly when it wants to do so". The BBC has approached X for comment. The prime minister was "abundantly clear that X needs to act and needs to act now", his spokesperson said. "It is time for X to grip this issue, if another media company had billboards in town centres showing unlawful images, it would act immediately to take them down or face public backlash," they added. But while Grok will only alter images on X for those who pay, it has no such restriction when accessed through its separate app and website. The Liberal Democrats have called for access to X to be temporarily restricted in the UK while the social media site is investigated. "Musk has thrown his toys out of the pram in protest at being held to account for the tsunami of abuse," said Professor Clare McGlynn, an expert in the legal regulation of pornography, sexual violence and online abuse. "Instead of taking the responsible steps to ensure Grok could not be used for abusive purposes, it has withdrawn access for the vast majority of users." And Hannah Swirsky, head of policy at the Internet Watch Foundation, said it "does not undo the harm which has been done". "We do not believe it is good enough to simply limit access to a tool which should never have had the capacity to create the kind of imagery we have seen in recent days," she said. The charity previously said its analysts had discovered "criminal imagery" of girls aged between 11 and 13 which "appeared to have been created" using Grok. "Sitting and waiting for unsafe products to be abused before taking action is unacceptable," Swirsky said. 'Subscribe to unlock' Grok is a free tool which users can tag directly in posts or replies under other users' posts to ask it for a particular response. But the feature has also allowed people to request it to edit images - and ask it to digitally strip people of most of their clothing. Grok has fulfilled many user requests asking it to edit images of women to show them in bikinis or little clothing - something those subject to such requests have told the BBC left them feeling "humiliated" and "dehumanised". However as of Friday morning, Grok has told users asking it to alter images uploaded to X that "image generation and editing are currently limited to paying subscribers". It adds users "can subscribe to unlock these features". Some posts on the platform seen by BBC News suggest only those with a blue tick "verified" mark - exclusive to X's paid subscriber tier - were able to successfully request image edits to Grok. Dr Daisy Dixon, a lecturer in philosophy at Cardiff University and female X user who said she had seen an increase in people using Grok to undress her, welcomed the change but said it felt "like a sticking plaster". "Grok needs to be totally redesigned and have built-in ethical guardrails to prevent this from ever happening again," she told the BBC. "Elon Musk also needs to acknowledge this for what it is - yet another instance of gender-based violation." Prof McGlynn said X's move echoed its approach to pornographic Taylor Swift deepfakes on the platform last year - where it blocked searches for sexualised material generated of the popstar using a Grok AI video feature. "He is doing this to stoke free speech arguments," she added. "He will claim regulation is stifling people's use of this technology. But, all the regulation requires is that he takes necessary precautions to reduce harm." 'Ofcom must restrict X' Ofcom's powers under the Online Safety Act include being able to seek a court order to prevent third parties from helping the Elon Musk-owned platform raise money or be accessed in the UK. The BBC has approached the regulator for comment. Lib Dem frontbenchers Victoria Collins, Marie Goldman and Max Wilkinson have written to Ofcom boss Dame Melanie Dawes, asking her to take action. "If any other platform were found to be facilitating the mass generation of sexual abuse imagery at this scale, it is difficult to believe it would be permitted to continue operating uninterrupted," they wrote. "Ofcom must restrict access to X now while an investigation takes place." Downing Street reiterated the government's "full support" for regulator Ofcom to use all its powers – up to and including a ban. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer previously called images generated by Grok "disgraceful" and "disgusting". Meanwhile the Conservatives reiterated comments made following PMQs on Wednesday by a spokesperson for Kemi Badenoch, who called deepfake images "absolutely abhorrent".

**Excerpt**

India pushes back at Trump aide's claim about US trade deal breakdown India has pushed back at US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick's claims that the trade deal between the countries stalled because Prime Minister Narendra Modi did not call President Donald Trump. Trump imposed 50% tariffs on Indian goods in August, including a penalty for buying Russian oil, after the talks stalled. Both sides are now back to negotiating a deal but there is no clarity on when it will materialise and several informal deadlines have been missed. Key sticking points remain even now - including agriculture. Washington has been pushing for greater access to India's farm sector but Delhi has fiercely protected it. However, Lutnick suggested the deal was close to completion at the start. "It was all set up. I said [to the Indian side] you got to have Modi call the president. They were uncomfortable doing it, so Modi didn't call," Lutnick said in a podcast released on Friday. The White House has not yet commented on Lutnick's assertions. India, however, said on Friday that the characterisation of the discussions between Delhi and Washington in the remarks made by Lutnick was "not accurate". "India and the US were committed to negotiating a bilateral trade agreement as far back as 13 February last year. Since then both sides have held multiple rounds of negotiations to arrive at a balanced and mutually beneficial trade agreement. On several occasions, we have been close to a deal," foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal told reporters. He added that Modi and Trump had spoken on the phone eight times last year, covering "covering different aspects of our wide-ranging partnership". Speaking on the All-In Podcast, a business and technology show hosted by four venture capitalists, Lutnick said that Trump's philosophy of making deals was like a "staircase" - meaning the "first stair gets the best deal". He said that India was the second country to enter into negotiations with the US for a trade deal after the UK, and that Washington gave Delhi "three Fridays" to close the deal. His role, Lutnick said, was to negotiate the contracts and set up the whole deal but that Trump was the one who closed them - and that India's reluctance to set up the phone call meant the agreement ran into trouble. He added that after that, US closed a slew of deals with other countries, including Indonesia and Vietnam. He also said that when India got back later saying they were ready to take the initial deal, "the train had left the station". But the terms of the deal that Lutnick claims India missed are unclear. Agriculture, for instance, has been a key sticking point in the negotiations - Washington has been pushing for greater access to India's farm sector but Delhi has fiercely protected it. In December, United States Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told senators in Washington that the US had received the "best ever offer" from India. He also called India a "tough nut to crack". Trump has also made several comments about India and Modi in recent days, including warning of an increase in tariffs if Delhi does not stop buying Russian oil. India ramped up its purchase of cheaper oil from Moscow after the Ukraine war. Delhi had defended its decision saying that it needed to think about the energy needs of its vast population. Since the tariffs kicked in, oil refiners in India have been cutting their purchases from Moscow, according to several reports. Lutnick's comments come two days after US Senator Lindsey Graham said that Trump had "greenlit" a punishing Russia sanctions bill that, if passed by Congress, would allow for even higher secondary tariffs and sanctions on countries doing business with Moscow. Jaiswal said on Friday that India was "aware of the proposed bill" and was "closely following developments", reiterating the country's stance on the energy needs of its population. Despite the 50% tariffs, India's good exports to the US jumped more than 22% in November from a year earlier. The tariffs and the accompanying rhetoric have put a strain on the relationship between India and the US. Modi, who has shared a warm relationship with Trump, was among the first world leaders to visit the White House after the president was sworn in. But since then, the relationship has gone downhill. Delhi has repeatedly denied claims by Trump that he brokered a ceasefire between India and Pakistan after a four-day conflict in May. In June, India said that Modi had told Trump that Delhi would never accept third-party mediation with Pakistan on the issue of Kashmir. Since then, the two leaders have spoken on the phone a few times, including in September when Trump called to wish Modi on his birthday.

### 3. [Vance criticises Denmark and Europe's handling of 'critical' Greenland](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2lgjd51v95o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

Vance criticises Denmark and Europe's handling of 'critical' Greenland US Vice-President JD Vance says Greenland is "critical" for the defence of the US and the world against possible Russian or Chinese missile attacks - and that Europe and Denmark have "not done a good job" in securing the area. Vance told Fox News that they had not only under-invested in Greenland's defences, but also failed to engage with President Donald Trump's argument over the issue. US officials are "actively" discussing a potential offer to buy Greenland - a semi-autonomous Danish territory - the White House said on Wednesday, a day after suggesting military action to annex it to the US was also an option. Denmark, a fellow Nato member, has warned this would spell the end of the alliance. Both Greenland and Denmark have repeatedly stressed the island is not for sale. Despite being the most sparsely populated territory, Greenland's location between North America and the Arctic makes it well placed for early warning systems in the event of missile attacks, and for monitoring vessels in the region. The US already has more than 100 military personnel permanently stationed at its Pituffik base in Greenland's north-western tip - a facility that has been operated by the US since World War Two. Under existing agreements with Denmark, the US has the power to bring as many troops as it wants to Greenland. In recent years, there has also been increased interest in Greenland's natural resources - including rare earth minerals, uranium and iron - which are becoming easier to access as its ice melts due to climate change. Scientists think it could also have significant oil and gas reserves. "People do not realise that the entire missile defence infrastructure is partially dependent on Greenland," Vance said in his interview on Wednesday. "If God forbid the Russians and the Chinese - not saying they're going to - but if, God forbid, somebody launched a nuclear missile into our continent, they launched a nuclear missile at Europe, Greenland is a critical part of that missile defence. "So you ask yourself, 'have the Europeans, have the Danes done a proper job of securing Greenland and of making sure it can continue to serve as an anchor for world security and missile defence?' And the answer is obviously they haven't," he said. Concerns over the future of the territory resurfaced after Trump's use of military force against Venezuela on Saturday to seize its President Nicolás Maduro. Trump previously made an offer to buy the island in 2019, during his first presidential term, only to be told it was not for sale. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Wednesday that he would hold talks with Denmark next week. A day earlier, European leaders issued a joint statement rallying behind Denmark. "Greenland belongs to its people, and only Denmark and Greenland can decide on matters concerning their relations," the leaders of France, the UK, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain and Denmark said in a joint statement. Stressing they were as keen as the US on Arctic security, the European signatories said this must be achieved by Nato allies, including the US, "collectively". They also called for "upholding the principles of the UN Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders". Aaja Chemnitz, one of two MPs in the Danish parliament representing Greenland, told the BBC that the comments from the Trump administration were "a clear threat". "It's completely disrespectful from the US side to not rule out annexing our country and to annex another Nato ally," she said. But Chemnitz said she saw this as unlikely and that instead, "what we are going to see is that they will put pressure on us in order to make sure that they will take over Greenland over time". Aleqatsiaq Peary, a 42-year-old Inuit hunter living in Greenland's remote northerly town of Qaanaaq, appeared indifferent to the potential of US ownership. "It would be switching from one master to another, from one occupier to another," he told the BBC. "We are a colony under Denmark. We are already losing a lot from being under the Danish government." Saying that he did not have "time for Trump", he added that people were "in need". Hunters like him, he explained, hunted with dogs on the sea ice and fish "but the sea ice is melting and hunters cannot make a living anymore". Additional reporting by Adrienne Murray in Copenhagen

**Excerpt**

Trump's grand plan to reshape the world order leaves Europe with a difficult choice to make For 80 years, what bound the United States to Europe was a shared commitment to defence and a common set of values: a commitment to defend democracy, human rights and the rule of law. That era was inaugurated in March 1947 in an 18-minute speech by President Harry Truman, in which he pledged US support to defend Europe against further expansion by the Soviet Union. America led the creation of Nato, the World Bank, the IMF and the United Nations. And it bound itself into what became known as the "rules-based international order", in which nation states committed to a series of mutual obligations and shared burdens, designed to defend the democratic world against hostile authoritarian powers. Now, the new US National Security Strategy (NSS), published in December, signals that, for the White House, that shared endeavour has ended; that much of what the world has taken for granted about America's role is over. The review refers to the "so-called 'rules-based international order'", putting the latter phrase in inverted commas: a kind of delegitimisation by punctuation mark. Vice-President JD Vance warned America's European allies that this was coming in a speech at the Munich Security Conference in February 2025. He told them bluntly that the real threat to Europe did not come from Russia but from within - from those censoring free speech, suppressing political opposition and therefore undermining European democracy. And he was damning about the "leftist liberal network". The French newspaper Le Monde said the speech was a declaration of "ideological war" against Europe. Last month's NSS codifies Vance's remarks, and, in black and white, elevates them to the status of doctrine. "Certainly America is no longer the country that promoted the global values that have been in place since the end of the Second World War," says Karin von Hippel, who previously held senior positions in the US State Department and is a former Director of the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), a Whitehall think tank. "It is shifting to a very different place." So, if the world is indeed moving away from that order, what is it moving towards? And what does it mean for the rest of the world and in particular for Europe? 'We have a different world today' "International institutions, notably the United Nations, have been marked by dramatically anti-American sentiment, and have not served our or any other particular purpose," says Victoria Coates, a vice-president at The Heritage Foundation, a prominent right-wing think tank in Washington. In the eyes of Coates - who was previously the Deputy National Security Adviser to US President Donald Trump - change to the international order is inevitable in a changing world. "The other issue we face here is that when that so-called rules-based international order was established after the Second World War, 80 short years ago, China wasn't a major concern. "We just have a different world today." This rules-based international order, built in the years after World War Two, was created by a generation that had come of age during an era of Great Power geopolitics, and had seen that system descend, twice, into catastrophic global conflict. That international order, flawed and incomplete though it undoubtedly was, was the legacy of that experience. But the NSS directly argues that American strategy went astray in the years since - and it blames what it calls "American foreign policy elites". "They lashed American policy to a network of international institutions, some of which are driven by outright anti-Americanism and many by a transnationalism that explicitly seeks to dissolve individual state sovereignty," it says. It suggests that in future, the US will seek to roll back the influence of supranational bodies. "The world's fundamental political unit is and will remain the nation-state… We stand for the sovereign rights of nations, against the sovereignty-sapping incursions of the most intrusive transnational organizations…" Elsewhere in the document, reflecting on the "balance of power", it states: "The outsized influence of larger, richer, and stronger nations is a timeless truth of international relations." The Kremlin responded to the review with praise, saying much of it aligned with Moscow's own thinking. "I think Trump, Xi, Putin and their more authoritarian acolytes are seeking to return us to an era of Great Power politics," says Field Marshal Lord Richards, who, as General Sir David Richards, was the head of the UK's armed forces from 2010 till 2013. Yet Sir Lawrence Freedman, Emeritus Professor of War Studies at King's College London, believes the new Security Strategy is not as radical a break with the past as it may appear. "We need to be careful about the rules-based international order, which is a term that came into general use in the last decade or so," he argues. "Look back and you find plenty of violations of the rules, Vietnam for example. So there's a sort of rosy glow about the past at times and everyone should be careful about nostalgia for what was a complex past." Muscular reassertion of the Monroe doctrine Washington's military operation in the Venezuelan capital Caracas that led to the capture of the country's leader Nicolas Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, is an early example of this more muscular assertion of sovereign unilateralism. Some international law experts have questioned the legality of the Trump administration's actions, and argued the US may have violated international statutes governing the use of force. The US maintains its actions were legally justified. "Under American law it certainly was [legal]" Robert Wilkie, who served as an Undersecretary of Defense in the first Trump administration, has previously told the BBC. "Maduro - most of our European partners have not recognised his regime so he is an illegitimate figure. Because of that he is stripped of the normal protections that heads of state would have [...]particularly when were are looking at constitutional provisions that exist in the United States, that would supersede anything the UN says." The NSS claims, for the United States, the right to be the pre-eminent power in the Western Hemisphere, and to bend its Latin American and Caribbean neighbours into alignment with Washington's interests. This is a muscular reassertion of the 1823 Monroe Doctrine and its promise of US supremacy in the Western hemisphere. Colombia, Panama and Cuba are all also in the President's sights. "This starts primarily with the Panama Canal," says Victoria Coates. "The degree to which control of the canal is necessary to the United States cannot be overstated." China is now Latin America's biggest trading partner and a major infrastructure investor there. The NSS aims to roll back Chinese influence in Washington's backyard. When the canal was handed over to Panama, in 1999, by President George HW Bush, says Coates, "we were in the assumption that China was a reasonable actor… That turned out not to be true… "So making sure that the United States retains a prime position over the canal is critical, and I think Panama is for the first time getting that message from the United States." But Sir Lawrence Freedman is among those who argue that the US's ability to control its neighbours is not unlimited. "The Strategy Review might say this is our hemisphere and we can do what we want, but there are still constraints. They may have extricated Maduro and his wife, but they're still dealing with the old regime. "They're not running the country, despite what Trump says." Under the new strategy, the United States will no longer pressure authoritarian regimes to improve their human rights records. In a phrase taken from the US Declaration of Independence of 1776, the review declares, "All nations are entitled by 'the laws of nature and nature's God' to a 'separate and equal station' with respect to one another." In the Middle East, for example, the US says it will abandon the "misguided experiment with hectoring these nations - especially the Gulf monarchies - into abandoning their traditions and historic forms of government". "The key to successful relations with the Middle East," it adds, "is accepting the region, its leaders, and its nations as they are while working together on areas of common interest." But it seems the same level of respect for traditions and historic forms of government is not extended to the democratic and allied nations of Europe. Whilst it refers to an American sentimental attachment to the European continent - and to Britain and Ireland - what's striking about this paper is that it seeks to redefine what is worth defending in the Western world. This review is civilisational in its reach, and argues for a civilisation that is no longer built on the shared values of the Truman Doctrine, but instead on the primacy of the sovereign nation-state. Where does this leave Europe? The review is damning about Europe's "current trajectory" and raises questions about whether some European nations can be regarded as dependable allies in the future. It talks about "economic decline" but adds that this is "eclipsed by the real and more stark prospect of civilizational erasure". Elsewhere in the document, it states: "It is more than plausible that within a few decades at the latest, certain Nato members will become majority non-European," which raises doubts about their viability as long-term security partners, the strategy suggests. "It's a very nativist document," argues Karin von Hippel. "It's very ideological. The underlying message is that the Christian white male is no longer running many of the countries [in the West] and we're seeing a threat to the dominance that the Christian white male has had in the United States and Europe. "They're very careful not to say any of that explicitly but I think that's what's implied." But Victoria Coates argues that, in her view, the "larger struggle we find ourselves in" is indeed civilisational. "Sovereignty is also a critical issue," she says. "Looking at the European Union project, especially after Brexit, I think a lot of countries are wondering if subverting the national interest to Brussels is a winning strategy. "I do think that is one of the institutions that the NSS does call into question." This chimes with the interests of the American tech giants that oppose EU efforts to regulate their activities on the European continent. Last month Elon Musk posted on X that the European Union should be abolished and sovereignty returned to the individual nation states. 'Cultivating resistance to Europe's trajectory' The review is clear about how Europe can regain its "self-confidence". It says: "The growing influence of patriotic European parties indeed gives cause for great optimism. Our goal should be to help Europe correct its current trajectory. We will need a strong Europe to help us successfully compete." And one of its policies for doing this is by "cultivating resistance to Europe's current trajectory within European nations". What is meant precisely by "cultivating resistance" raises many questions. In Europe, some have already concluded that the USA may no longer be a reliable ally, at a time when Russia poses a growing threat. After Vice-President Vance's speech in Munich, Germany's Chancellor, Friedrich Merz, said Europe would need to "achieve independence" from America with a reshaped Nato. But this takes time. "It's not achievable in the short term," says Sir Lawrence. "The Europeans have become very dependent upon the United States, and this was a matter of choice: it was cheaper and simpler. "Though in practice it would be desirable to be able to act without the Americans… in practice it's going to take years to disentangle ourselves. And it'll be extremely expensive. "So Europe has a difficulty: it can't rely on the Americans, but it can't operate easily without them." As to the pressing question of what it means for Europe - and the EU - in the near future, Lord Richards issues a stark warning: "[It] risks falling between the cracks." "The EU cannot be a Great Power, nor can any of its constituent nations," he argues. "[So] the UK/EU must decide under whose sphere of influence they should shelter? "The answer is they are likely to remain in the USA's - and within a reshaped Nato." 'A popular revolt against the establishment' But Lord Richards also believes that increased spending commitment is long overdue. "European nations are going to have to spend much more on their own defence. This has long been coming but in the UK it is not yet translating into any fresh money. Indeed this year the armed forces are being required to save money rather than spend more." The US has been pushing Europe to increase defence spending for years, notes Sir Lawrence. "The message that Europe needs to do more for its own defence has been around a long time. It was pushed by both Obama and Biden." Last year Trump secured from the European allies a commitment to increase defence spending to 5% of GDP - and in doing so may have done Europe a security favour, by pushing it, in the long term, towards greater operational independence from Washington. "Spending has gone up quite significantly," says Sir Lawrence. "The Germans have been making quite impressive strides. So there is movement, not as fast as many would wish, but it's happening." The review is clear about how America thinks it can "help" Europe. "We want to work with aligned countries that want to restore their former greatness," it says. Ultimately, what the report reveals is not so much an ideological divide that separates the US and Europe, but one that slices through both continents. Both sides of the Atlantic have certain concerns in common, argues Victor Mallet, a Paris-based journalist and author of a forthcoming book, Far Right France: Le Pen, Bardella and the Future of Europe. "Concerns about immigration, concerns about the economy… and there's an extraordinary cultural gulf between supporters of people like Donald Trump, the National Rally in France, the AfD in Germany, and the intellectual, metropolitan, educated liberal elite. "It's definitely a popular revolt against the establishment." He believes that one of the problems is inequality. "America has, on average, the richest group of consumers the world has ever seen and yet many ordinary Americans find it hard to make ends meet and the same applies in Western Europe." In the NSS, the US commits to scrapping certain practices, such as Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, that are derided by many in Trump's base. In this document, the culture wars that shape America's bitter public discourse now to a degree also shape its in foreign policy, and - by extension, affect the security of the Western world. Russia is not mentioned as a hostile power, despite its invasion of Ukraine, a Western ally. For in the culture wars, some in Trump's Maga base see in Vladimir Putin not a foe but a natural ally in the defence of white, Christian nationalist civilisation: a man who proudly defends his country, its traditions and identity - the very attributes, after all, that they value and admire in Donald Trump.

'He's crazy': BBC speaks to Greenlanders about Trump's threats This week, Donald Trump repeated his desire to take over Greenland and make it part of the United States, potentially by using military force. The BBC's Europe Editor Katya Adler visited the Arctic island's capital, Nuuk, to ask locals what they thought of the US president's renewed threats. One Greenlander said she thought Trump was "crazy", while another said residents "just want to be left alone". It comes against a background of global superpowers scrambling for the Arctic for its strategic defence capabilities, as well as for rare earths and other minerals, which are newly accessible due to melting ice.
