Colombia sees 'real threat' of US military action, president tells BBC Colombia's President Gustavo Petro has told the BBC that he believes there is now a "real threat" of US military action against Colombia. Petro said the United States is treating other nations as part of a US "empire". It comes after Trump threatened Colombia with military action. He said that the US risks transforming from "dominating the world" to becoming "isolated from the world." He also accused US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents of acting like "Nazi brigades". Trump has significantly expanded ICE operations as part of what the administration says is a crackdown on crime and immigrants who illegally entered the US. The BBC has approached the White House for comment. Following US strikes on Venezuela and the seizure of Nicolás Maduro, US President Donald Trump said a military operation targeting Colombia "sounds good". Trump has also repeatedly told Petro to "watch his ass", remarks Petro strongly condemned. Trump and Petro spoke by phone on Wednesday evening, after which Trump said he would meet his Colombian counterpart at the White House in the "near future. Writing on his Truth Social platform late on Wednesday after the call, Trump described his conversation with Petro as a "Great Honour". A Colombian official said at the time that the conversation had reflected a 180-degree shift in rhetoric "from both sides." But on Thursday, Petro's tone suggested relations had not significantly improved. He told the BBC the call lasted just under an hour, "most of it occupied by me," and covered "drug trafficking Colombia" and Colombia's view on Venezuela and "what is happening around Latin America regarding the United States." Petro strongly criticised recent US immigration enforcement, accusing ICE agents of operating like "Nazi brigades". President Trump has often blamed immigration for crime and trafficking in the US, using it to justify large-scale enforcement operations, and has accused countries like Colombia and Venezuela of not doing enough to tackle drug-trafficking. Since returning to the White House, the US president has sent ICE agents to cities across the country. The agency enforces immigration laws and conducts investigations into undocumented immigration. It also plays a role in removing undocumented immigrants from the US. The administration says it deported 605,000 people between 20 January and 10 December 2025. It also said 1.9 million immigrants had "voluntarily self-deported", following an aggressive public awareness campaign encouraging people to leave the country on their own to avoid arrest or detention. About 65,000 people were in ICE detention as of 30 November 2025, according to data obtained by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse's immigration project, a compendium of government data from Syracuse University. This week a US immigration agent shot dead a 37-year-old US citizen in the city of Minneapolis, sparking protests overnight. Federal officials said the woman, Renee Nicole Good, had tried to run over immigration agents with her car but the city mayor, Democrat Jacob Frey, said the agent who shot her had acted recklessly and demanded agents leave the city. Petro said ICE had "reached the point where it no longer only persecutes Latin Americans in the streets, which for us is an affront, but it also kills United States citizens." He added that if this continued, "instead of a United States dominating the world – an imperial dream – it is a United States isolated from the world. An empire was not built by being isolated from the world." Petro said the US has for "decades" treated other governments, particularly in Latin America, as an "empire" regardless of the law. The two leaders have long been adversaries, frequently trading insults and tariff threats on social media. Following the US's military action in Venezuela, Petro accused Washington of seeking wars over "oil and coal," adding that if the US had not pulled out of the Paris Agreement, where countries agreed to limit global temperature rising by reducing fossil fuel use, "there would be no wars, there would be a much more democratic and peaceful relationship with the world. And South America." "The Venezuelan issue is about this," he said. After Trump's comments threatening military action in Colombia, demonstrations were held across the country in the name of sovereignty and democracy. Petro told the BBC that Trump's remarks amounted to a "real threat", citing Colombia's loss of territory such as Panama in the 20th century, and said "the prospect of removing [the threat] depends on the ongoing conversations." Asked how Colombia would defend itself in the event of a US attack, Petro said he would "prefer it to be about dialogue." He said that "work is being done" on this. But he added: "Colombia's history shows how it has responded to large armies." "It's not about confronting a large army with weapons we don't have. We don't even have anti-aircraft defenses. Instead, we rely on the masses, our mountains, and our jungles, as we always have." Petro confirmed he had also spoken to Delcy Rodríguez, Venezuela's acting president and former vice president and oil minister, and invited her to Colombia. He said Venezuela had "long been subject to interference by various intelligence agencies," adding that while such agencies had permission to operate in Colombia, it was solely to combat drug trafficking. He denounced attempts at what he said were other "covert operations" in Colombia. He did not directly comment when asked whether he feared the CIA could carry out covert operations similar to their actions in Venezuela in Colombia, or whether he feared his own government or inner circles may have informants. Maduro was captured by the US army's Delta Force, the military's top counter-terrorism unit, after a CIA source in Venezuelan government helped the US track his location. As the world's largest producer of cocaine, Colombia is a major hub for the global drug trade. It also has significant oil reserves, as well as gold, silver, emeralds, platinum and coal. The US has said it will control sales of Venezuelan oil "indefinitely" as it prepares to roll back restrictions on the country's crude in global markets. Speaking aboard Air Force One after the Venezuela operation, Trump described Petro as a "sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States," adding: "He's not going to be doing it for very long." Petro denied the claims, saying it has "always been proven that I'm not involved in that." "For 20 years I have been fighting against the drug cartels, at the cost of my family having to go into exile," he said. A former guerrilla, Petro has pursued a "total peace" strategy since taking office, prioritising dialogue with armed groups. Critics say the approach has been too soft, with cocaine production reaching record levels. Asked what failed and whether he accepted responsibility, Petro said coca cultivation growth was slowing and described "two simultaneous approaches." "One, talking about peace with groups that are bandits. And the other, developing a military offensive against those who don't want peace." He said negotiations were ongoing in southern Colombia, "where the greatest reduction in coca leaf cultivation has occurred" and "where the homicide rate in Colombia has fallen the most." Cocaine is made from the leaves of the coca plant. The policy of dialogue, he said, was intended to "de-escalate violence", adding: "we're not fools, we know who we're negotiating with."

One dead, dozens trapped after giant landfill collapses in Philippines A mountain of rubbish collapsed at a landfill in the central Philippines on Thursday, killing a 22-year-old woman and leaving more than 30 people missing, authorities have said. Rescuers pulled 12 injured sanitation workers from debris at the Binaliw Landfill in Cebu City, who were later hospitalised. Many of the missing are believed to be workers at the landfill. The mayor of Cebu told news outlet ABS-CBN that it may be difficult to reach survivors because of the potential for further collapse. The cause of the collapse is still unclear, but Cebu City councillor Joel Garganera said it was likely the result of poor waste management practices. Some 300 people from various government agencies and civilian groups have been deployed to the privately-owned landfill. Several excavators, ambulances and fire trucks have also been seen on site. "All response teams remain fully engaged in search and retrieval efforts to locate the remaining missing persons," Cebu Mayor Nestor Archival said in a Facebook post on Friday. "This is not like other landslides that you can just excavate. If you pull from the top, the bottom is soft. Let's say there is a person there, when you get the debris, it might get worse," he said, ABS-CBN reported. Cebu City councillor Joel Garganera said the incident may have happened suddenly, but was likely a result of poor waste management practices. Operators had been cutting into the mountain, mining the soil, and then piling garbage to form another mountain of waste, Garganera told local newspaper The Freeman. "It's not a sanitary landfill. It's already an open dumpsite," he said. Families are waiting for updates on their loved ones trapped in the debris. One Binaliw resident, Belen Antigua, told Rappler that her son had survived the landslide but she was still waiting for her other relatives to be found. Another said that families had been gathered at the landfill to look for their children since Friday morning. "I could not understand my emotions. They said those trapped are calling for help, so there is a possibility that my brother is still there," Michelle Lumapas, whose brother works at the landfill, told ABS-CBN. The Binaliw landfill is about 15 hectares (37 acres). Landfills are common in major Philippine cities like Cebu, which is the trading centre and transportation gateway of the Visayas, the archipelago nation's central islands.

### 3. [Russia hits Ukraine with rarely-used Oreshnik missile in fresh strikes](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgqe9kv9xxvo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

Russia hits Ukraine with rarely-used Oreshnik missile in fresh strikes Russia has used the Oreshnik ballistic missile as part of a massive overnight strike on Ukraine. Four people were killed and 25 others injured in Kyiv on Thursday night, where loud booms could be heard for several hours, setting the sky alight with explosions. It is only the second time that Moscow has used the Oreshnik, which was first deployed to hit the central city of Dnipro in November 2024. Russia's defence ministry said the strike was a response to a Ukrainian drone attack on Vladimir Putin's residence in late December, which Kyiv denies carrying out. While the ministry did not specify what had been the Oreshnik's target, shortly before midnight (22:00 GMT) videos began circulating on social media showing numerous explosions on the outskirts of the western city of Lviv. Ukrainian authorities confirmed that a ballistic missile had struck infrastructure in Lviv, about 60km (40 miles) from the Polish border. The Oreshnik is an intermediate-range, hypersonic ballistic missile, meaning it can potentially reach up to 5,500km (3,417 miles). It is thought to have a warhead that deliberately fragments during its final descent into several, independently targeted inert projectiles, causing distinctive repeated explosions moments apart. "Such a strike close to EU and Nato border is a grave threat to the security on the European continent and a test for the transatlantic community," Ukrainian foreign minister Andrii Sybiha said. The strike was launched "in response to [Putin's] own hallucinations," he added, referring to the alleged drone attack on the president's home in December. The EU immediately cast serious doubt on whether the strike had ever happened, and last week Donald Trump said he did not think any such attack had taken place. As Lviv and other western regions were targeted on Thursday night, more than a dozen missiles and hundreds of drones were deployed during the attack on Kyiv. A paramedic was among those killed while arriving at a damanged apartment in Kyiv. The capital's mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said it had been a "double-tap" hit – in which the first strike is followed by a second, killing rescuers who have arrived to help the injured. Two apartment buildings along the east bank of the Dnipro River and a high-rise building in the city's central district were also targeted. The power supply was disrupted in several of the city's neighbourhoods in the middle of a particularly harsh winter and as Kyiv braces for -15C (5F) temperatures this weekend. The targeting of power plants has become a constant feature of this war, with Ukraine increasingly responding in kind to Russia's sustained attacks on energy infrastructure that regularly leave millions without access to electricity or heating. On Thursday night, as Moscow's attack on Ukraine was ongoing, half a million people in the Russian region of Belgorod were left without power following Ukrainian shelling of infrastructure, the local governor said. Authorities also said that a Ukrainian strike on a Russian power plant in the city of Oryol, further north, affected the water and heating systems.

Venezuelan government begins releasing political prisoners The Venezuelan government has started releasing detainees considered political prisoners by human rights groups, in what officials described as a goodwill gesture. Spain's foreign ministry said five of its nationals had been released. Among them is prominent Venezuelan-Spanish rights activist, Rocío San Miguel, her family confirmed to US media. The move comes after the US seized Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro in a lightning raid on the capital, Caracas, on Saturday, to face drug trafficking charges in New York. The release of political prisoners in Venezuela has been a long-held US demand, especially during moments of heightened repression around elections or protests. Jorge Rodríguez, the head of Venezuela's National Assembly and the brother of its interim president Delcy Rodríguez, announced on state television that "a significant number" would be released immediately, without specifying the number or identity of prisoners being freed. Hundreds of political prisoners are detained in Venezuelan prisons, with only a handful thought to have been released so far. Jorge Rodríguez said the interim government was releasing them in the interest of "national unity and peaceful coexistence". Rocío San Miguel, a vocal critic of Maduro and a defence expert, was the first prisoner confirmed to be freed. Her family told the New York Times that she was taken to the Spanish embassy in Caracas. Arrested in 2024, she was accused of being involved in a plot to kill the then-president and faced charges of treason, conspiracy and terrorism. Her arrest shocked human rights activists and, because her whereabouts were unknown, was labelled as potential "enforced disappearance" by the UN Human Rights Office. Venezuelan human rights organisations - some of which have members or their founders in jail - welcomed the news with caution. Despite being a key lieutenant of Maduro, Delcy Rodríguez's interim administration has appeared willing to co-operate with the US since it took its leader and made sweeping declarations about the South American nation's future. About 50 to 80 prisoners are believed to be held at the notorious El Helicoide prison, which US President Donald Trump announced would be closed following Maduro's capture. The prison gained international notoriety for detaining alleged political opponents, with reports by human rights groups of torture including beatings and electrocution. The announcement also comes shortly after US President Donald Trump stated that he had "given orders to close that prison," which had become one of the most notorious symbols of political repression in the country. Venezuelan human rights group Provea warned El Helicoide's anticipated closure should not deflect attention from the other detention sites still running across the country. Opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado, who has several close allies in prison, has repeatedly demanded releases. In a sit-down interview with the Fox News show Hannity, Trump said Machado was expected to come to the US "next week sometime". Machado told host Sean Hannity earlier in the week that she wanted to give the US president her Nobel Peace Prize. When asked by Hannity whether Trump would accept the offer, he said "that would be a great honour". Venezuela's opposition and human rights groups have said for years the government used detentions to stamp out dissent and silence critics. Since the widely disputed 2024 election, the opposition claimed legal proceedings against activists, journalists and political adversaries increased. Attorney General Tarek Saab and others in the government repeatedly denied Venezuela held political prisoners, arguing those detained were arrested for genuine crimes.

Published - Stan Wawrinka has been handed an Australian Open wildcard as he begins the final season of his career, with Australian Nick Kyrgios missing out. Three-time Grand Slam champion Wawrinka announced in December that 2026 will be the final season of his trophy-laden career. The 40-year-old former world number three won the first of his three major titles at Melbourne Park. "Winning the Australian Open in 2014, my first Grand Slam title, is an absolute career highlight for me, so I'm incredibly grateful to receive this wildcard," said Wawrinka. "To have the chance to play the Australian Open at the beginning of my final year on tour means the world to me." Wawrinka is currently ranked 156th in the world and won the most recent of his 16 titles in Geneva in 2017. 'I'd rather give my spot to someone ready to make it count' Former Wimbledon finalist Kyrgios said he had chosen not to contest the men's singles competition at his home slam because he does not yet feel ready to play five-set matches. The 30-year-old, who has fallen to 670th in the world after struggling with injuries over recent seasons, will enter the men's doubles competition, having won that event in 2022 alongside compatriot Thanasi Kokkinakis. "After some good conversations with Tennis Australia I've made the call to focus on doubles for this year's AO," Kyrgios wrote on social media. "I'm fit and back on court, but five-setters are a different beast and I'm not quite ready to go the distance yet. "This tournament means everything to me, but I'd rather give my spot to someone who's ready to make their moment count. "It's all building blocks and I'll be back next year and pumped to compete. See you out there."

### 6. [Trump withdraws US from key climate treaty and dozens of other groups](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp80ln97py5o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

Trump withdraws US from key climate treaty and dozens of other groups US President Donald Trump has withdrawn the US from dozens of international organisations, including many that work to combat climate change. Nearly half of the 66 affected bodies are UN-related, including the Framework Convention on Climate Change - a treaty that underpins all international efforts to combat global warming. Groups working on development, gender equality and conflict - areas the Trump administration had repeatedly dismissed as advancing "globalist" or "woke" agendas - are also included. The White House said the decision was taken because those entities "no longer serve American interests" and promote "ineffective or hostile agendas". The memorandum was signed on Wednesday following a review, with the White House describing the organisations as "a waste of taxpayer dollars". "These withdrawals will end American taxpayer funding and involvement in entities that advance globalist agendas over US priorities," it said in a statement. It added that many of the organisations promoted "radical climate policies, global governance and ideological programs that conflict with US sovereignty and economic strength". As well as the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the US has also withdrawn from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - the world's leading authority on climate science that pulls together the most respected reports on the science of rising global temperatures. Sources within the organisation told the BBC that they were concerned about the potential impact of the Trump administration's withdrawal on US scientists involved in producing the body's next set of studies. The White House has already blocked US scientists attending a meeting in China. Any restrictions on travel or the participation of US researchers could significantly delay the release of the next set of IPCC reports, including potentially its mitigation report - a key document guiding governments on how to tackle climate change. Non-UN organisations affected by the US withdrawal include those focused on clean energy co-operation, democratic governance and international security, such as the International Solar Alliance, the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance and the Global Counter-Terrorism Forum. Trump has already stripped many multilateral organisations he dislikes of funds and previously rejected the scientific consensus of man-made climate change as a "hoax". It will take a year for the US to be able to fully withdraw from the UNFCCC - but in reality the US ceased effective participation in the UN's climate change body long ago. It remains unclear whether the move will be challenged in the US courts, as many campaigners are now urging. While the US constitution allows presidents to join treaties "provided two thirds of Senators present concur", it does not specify what happens if they were to withdraw. As such, it is uncertain a future president could reverse Trump's decision and opt back in simply by applying. These latest withdrawals come after the president took the US out of the Paris Climate Agreement for a second time last year, and declined to send a delegation to the COP30 climate summit in Brazil. The US has also already withdrawn from the World Health Organization, the UN Human Rights Council and the UN's cultural agency, Unesco. European leaders have criticised this latest decision, warning it would weaken global co-operation. EU climate commissioner Wopke Hoekstra said the UNFCCC "underpins global climate action" and called the US retreat "regrettable and unfortunate", while the EU's clean transition vice-president Teresa Ribera said the administration showed little concern for the environment, health or human suffering. A member of a US-based non-profit advocacy group, the Union of Concerned Scientists, described the step as a "new low". Senior policy director Rachel Cleetus told news agency AFP that it was another sign the administration, which she described as "authoritarian" and "anti- science", was determined to sacrifice people's wellbeing and destabilise global co-operation.

**Excerpt**

Influential China church reports arrests as crackdown on Christians intensifies An influential Protestant church in China says prominent leaders have been arrested in what appears to be a growing crackdown on the underground church movement. Nine people were detained on Tuesday after police raided their homes and the church office in Chengdu, in central China, the Early Rain Covenant Church said. Five had been released by Wednesday. More than 1,000 miles away in Wenzhou, authorities began demolishing the Yayang Church building, video obtained by non-profit ChinaAid, which monitors religious persecution, shows. This latest wave of arrests, after others last year, shows the Communist Party's resolve to snuff out churches that do not align with its ideology, Christian groups say. The BBC has contacted China's embassy in the UK for comment. Authorities have not made any statements about the arrests or the demolition in Wenzhou. China promotes atheism and controls religion. The government said in 2018 that there were 44 million Christians in the country, but it's unclear if that number includes those who attend the many underground churches. The Communist Party has long pressured Christians to join only state-sanctioned churches led by government-approved pastors. But Christian groups say the grip has tightened noticeably, with arrests becoming more common and prompt. At least two church leaders in China have told the BBC that authorities are swiftly arresting unauthorised church leaders. In the past, these individuals would first be warned, then fined and finally detained if they still refused to comply with orders. Just weeks ago, Li Yingqiang, the current leader of Early Rain Covenant Church, had said he "sensed a storm gathering" and referred to "the imminent prospect of... another large-scale crackdown". "I dearly hope that none of our families shall ever again endure such a storm," he wrote in a letter to church members in November. "Yet as an elder appointed by the Lord to stand among you... it is my duty to remind you all to prepare yourselves before the storm returns." Mr Li and his wife, Zhang Xinyue, are among the four who remain in detention. Their church described the arrests as a "concerted operation" but said the grounds for arrest, and whether those detained had been charged, remain unclear. It added that it had lost contact with two other members but did not say they had been detained. "The situation is ongoing, with specific details yet to be fully confirmed," Early Rain Covenant Church (ERCC) said in a statement to members and supporters. It also also sought prayers for its members' safety and their perseverance in the Christian faith. In Wenzhou, local authorities brought in bulldozers, cranes and heavy machinery earlier this week to start taking down part of the Yayang Church building, as seen in the video. ChinaAid said it was told by multiple sources that hundreds of armed and special police officers have been deployed to stand guard outside the building. Sometimes known as "the Jerusalem of China", Wenzhou has more Christians than any other city in the country. Residents living near Yayang Church have been "driven away", while those working in the area has been instructed not to take photographs or record video, ChinaAid said. "The massive mobilisation against the two major independent church networks shows the central government is determined to stamp out Christian churches entirely, unless the church is totally indoctrinated into the party's ideology," said Bob Fu, who founded ChinaAid. In December, authorities arrested about 100 members of Yayang Church in Wenzhou over five days. At least 24 members remain in custody, according to Human Rights Watch. And in October last year, 30 leaders of Zion Church - one of China's biggest underground churches - were rounded up across seven cities. Founder Ezra Jin is still in custody. The Chinese government has also targeted the Early Rain Covenant Church, founded in 2008, for years. In 2018, authorities raided the Church and arrested founding pastor Wang Yi and his wife Jiang Rong. At least 100 church members were taken into custody in the following days in one of China's largest crackdowns on churches in the past decade. Mr Wang, an outspoken critic of the Communist Party's policies on religion, was jailed for "inciting subversion of state power" and "illegal business operations". He is due to be released in 2027. The church has continued to gather online and sometimes replays Mr Wang's recorded sermons to its members. "Xi Jinping's government has tightened ideological control and intensified its intolerance of loyalties beyond the Chinese Communist Party," said Yalkun Uluyol, China researcher at Human Rights Watch, referring to the Chinese premier. "Concerned governments and religious leaders around the world should press the Chinese government to free detained religious adherents and respect religious freedom in China." Under Xi, China has increased its control on religious freedom. Since 2015, he has called for the "Sinicisation of religions", which requires religious doctrines and practices to conform with Chinese culture and values. Last year, authorities banned clergy of all religions from preaching live on social media, organising online activities for children and raising funds online, unless these are carried out on government-approved platforms.

Published - Jose Mourinho took his players to stay at Benfica's training ground after they lost against Braga in the League Cup semi-finals - and the Portuguese manager said he hoped they "don't sleep and instead think a lot". Benfica lost Wednesday's tie 3-1 and ended the game with 10 men when former Manchester City defender Nicolas Otamendi was sent off. Mourinho, who was appointed manager in September, suggested his players would be staying at the club's training base in Seixal for the foreseeable future. "The players will sleep in Seixal, and on Thursday there is training, and the day after there's training," Mourinho said at a news conference after the Braga defeat. "Since there's no final on Saturday, our next game is against Porto next Wednesday. "When we arrive in Seixal [on Wednesday], everyone will go to their rooms. I hope the players sleep as well as I do, which is to say that they don't sleep at all. "That's what I wish for them. That they don't sleep and instead think a lot, like I'm going to think." Mourinho began his managerial career with Benfica in 2000 but took charge of only 10 games before leaving following a dispute with the club president. He has won 14 of his 23 matches in charge of Benfica in this stint and Wednesday's defeat halted an 11-game unbeaten streak. "On Thursday we can start talking, which isn't what happened in the locker room," Mourinho said. "In the locker room it was a monologue, and monologues don't work for me; I like to have a dialogue with the players. "We'll talk about the differences between the first and second halves and prepare in the best way possible for the game against Porto." Benfica travel to Porto in the quarter-finals of the Portuguese Cup on Wednesday. Mourinho's side sit third in the Primeira Liga, 10 points adrift of leaders Porto.

**Excerpt**

Spain's Catholic Church signs deal on sexual abuse compensation Spain's Roman Catholic Church has reached an agreement with the government to compensate victims of sexual abuse by members of the clergy. The accord follows complaints that religious leaders had failed to tackle the issue adequately. It means the government will manage possible compensation in co-ordination with the Church, handling cases where other legal avenues are no longer available because the alleged crime took place too long ago or the individual accused has passed away. Hundreds of thousands of Spaniards are estimated by the government to have suffered sexual abuse at the hands of Church figures. The move follows similar redress schemes in other nations where abuse has been uncovered. "A democracy should not allow the existence of victims who have never been compensated [and] whose situation, on the contrary, had been covered up," said Justice Minister Félix Bolaños after signing the agreement. He added that the agreement sought to "pay off an historic, moral debt that we had with victims of abuse within the Church". The other signatories were Luis Argüello, president of the Episcopal Conference and leader of the Spanish Catholic Church, and Jesús Díaz Sariego, president of Confer, which represents Catholic congregations and religious orders. Mr Sariego said the initiative was unprecedented as it tackled crimes that had gone past the statute of limitations. Argüello, who is archbishop of Valladolid, described the accord as "another step forward along the path that for years we have been travelling". A 2023 study by the Spanish ombudsman's office, which investigates public complaints, estimated that 1.1% of the population had suffered sexual abuse at the hands of members of the clergy or individuals linked to the Church - the equivalent of 440,000 people. The Church has contested these findings. It set up a reparation scheme that year to manage abuse claims. However, both the Socialist-led government and victims' organisations have been dissatisfied with the scheme's model, which did not allow input or oversight from outside the Church. In November, the Church said that 58 cases had been "resolved" under its framework. However, critics accused the institution of a lack of transparency and slowness. Newspaper El País, which has created a database of clerical abuse allegations, has documented cases affecting 2,948 victims dating back as far as the 1940s. Last June, several victims' groups broke off ties with the Spanish Church, alleging that it had excluded them from seeking reparations. The Vatican subsequently appeared to take a more prominent role, with the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors meeting Spanish victims and urging the country's Catholic leaders to bolster and facilitate reparations. Meetings between Justice Minister Bolaños and the Vatican's Secretary of State, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, appear to have raised the pressure further on the Church authorities in Madrid. Under the new system, victims will be able to file their cases before a new agency created by the justice ministry, which will then take them before the ombusdman's office, which will draw up a reparation proposal. The Church must then agree to the proposed compensation – if not, the case will be referred back to the ombudsman. Reparation can be symbolic, psychological, or economic, according to the agreement. In each case, the Church is responsible for its execution. The amount of financial compensation that could be paid out is not specified. However, the ombudsman has suggested following the lead of other European countries. In Belgium, an average of €6,000 ($7,000; £5,210) has been paid to victims in such cases, although the late Pope Francis described that amount as "too small". Ireland's redress board paid out an average of around €63,000 to victims. Sexual abuse by members of the clergy first received significant attention in the US and Canada in the 1980s. In the 1990s, the issue began to grow, with stories emerging in Argentina, Australia and revelations of widespread historical abuse in Ireland. By the early 2000s, sexual abuse within the Church was a major global story. Spain, a Catholic country, was affected by relatively few scandals in that time. However, investigations by the media have brought the issue to light more recently. In the most recent high-profile case, the bishop of Cádiz, Rafael Zornoza, resigned in November, following an accusation of abuse dating back to the 1990s. Victims' organisations have welcomed the new agreement in Spain. "This is an endemic, structural evil which has been within the Church and which it should have tackled a long time ago instead of covering up paedophiles," said Juan Cuatrecasas, of the Association for Stolen Childhood (Anir), who said he was "fully satisfied".

Published - The organisers of a professional women's tournament which has gone viral on social media because of a wildcard player's dire performance have acknowledged she should not have been allowed to play. Egyptian Hajar Abdelkader, 21, lost 6-0 6-0 and served 20 double faults during the first-round match in Nairobi on Wednesday, with the footage leaving many viewers wondering if she had ever played tennis before. The amateur player won only three points during her 37-minute debut - two double faults by opponent Lorena Schaedel and an unforced error from the bemused German, ranked 1,026th in the world. The match was part of an International Tennis Federation (ITF) W35 tournament, hosted by Tennis Kenya, the governing body for the sport in Kenya. Tennis Kenya said it had reached out to both Abdelkader and Schaedel to offer its support "given the extent and nature of coverage of this match". Tennis Kenya said Abdelkader had applied to enter the tournament as a wildcard and had been given a space at the last minute following the withdrawal of another player. The organisation said she was permitted to enter to maintain a balance of players and nations represented in the tournament, but said that in hindsight she should not have been allowed to play. "The federation has taken note of this experience and will ensure that such an extremely rare occurrence never happens again," the organisation added. "Tennis Kenya remains committed to fairness, transparency and the integrity of competition, as well as to the continued development of tennis in Kenya, East Africa, and across Africa." The Egyptian Tennis Federation confirmed to the BBC Abdelkader has never been registered as an Egyptian player and had not been entered into the tournament on Egypt's behalf. Egyptian Tennis Federation technical director Dia Nabil Loutfy said: "We would like to clarify that she is not registered with the Egyptian Tennis Federation, nor is she included in any of our official player lists. "Based on the information available to us, the player was previously residing in Kenya and participated in the ITF tournament in Nairobi through a wildcard granted by the Kenyan Tennis Federation. "The Egyptian Tennis Federation had no role whatsoever, whether directly or indirectly, in the nomination, approval, or issuance of this wildcard, and we were not involved in the player's entry into the tournament in any capacity." The organisation said it had no records relating to Abdelkader, and said she had never been affiliated with the Egyptian Tennis Federation.

Australians brace for 'property loss or worse' as bushfires destroy homes Australians in Victoria have been warned they should prepare for "property loss or worse" as much of the country faces extreme heatwave conditions. Temperatures on Friday and Saturday are forecast to hit record highs for most states and territories, with Victoria and South Australia in particular bracing for dangerous fire conditions due to strong winds and hot temperatures. A total fire ban is in place in Victoria and all regions across the state were given a "catastrophic" or "extreme" fire danger rating. "Victorians should brace themselves for more property loss or worse," Country Fire Authority (CFA) chief officer Jason Heffernan told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) on Friday. "The conditions were extreme yesterday. They're catastrophic today," Heffernan said. Temperatures in Melbourne are expected to hit 42C on Friday and while areas in north-west Victoria may reach 45C, a cool change is forecast in the south-west. A bushfire near Longwood, central Victoria, has burnt through nearly 36,000 hectares, authorities said, with at least 20 homes in the small town of Ruffy destroyed. Ruffy CFA captain George Noye said the town had been "severely" affected. "The main street looks like a bomb's gone off, we've lost a school," he told the ABC. "Some properties have lost everything. They've lost their livelihoods, they've lost their shearing sheds, livestock, just absolutely devastating. "But thankfully, at the moment, no lives have been lost." A statement from Victoria's state control centre on Friday said the Longwood fire was "incredibly dynamic, with the fire spreading in multiple directions" and may spread further than initial estimates. Victoria Police Deputy Commissioner Bob Hill said three people - two adults and a child - remain unaccounted for in the Longwood area. He said authorities spoke to them yesterday at their property, warning them to seek shelter as it was too late to evacuate. Fire officials returned later to find the home had burnt down but could not locate the three people. "They may be safe, they may be alive, let's not get ahead of ourselves, but we are keeping an open mind," Hill said. In the Australian Capital Territory, which includes the capital Canberra, a total fire ban was declared for the first time in six years. Sydney will see the mercury rise up to 42C on Saturday, before dropping to around 26C by Sunday. Another fire near Walwa, north-east Victoria, has burned through more than 17,000 hectares. Heffernan urged all Victorians to be on high alert, not just those near active fires. "That is how severe these conditions are at the moment, not only at the Longwood fire but across the state," he told the ABC. "My message at the moment to Victorians is yes, we are talking about Longwood and Walwa, but we have many other fires that have started this morning in and around communities... I am expecting more as the day goes on." In South Australia, local fire authorities said they had battled a number of small fires across the state overnight and temperatures were expected to hit 46C in some areas.

**Excerpt**

The secret mission to fly a president's body back home - pilot speaks to the BBC Exactly 31 years ago to the day, two Kenyan pilots, Hussein Mohamed Anshuur and Mohamed Adan, received an unexpected visitor at their office at Wilson Airport near the capital, Nairobi. It was a Nigerian diplomat, who drew them into a sensitive and secretive mission to fly the body of Somalia's former ruler Siad Barre back to his homeland for burial following his death in exile in Nigeria at the age of 80. Anshuur, previously a captain in the Kenyan Air Force, and Adan are partners in Bluebird Aviation, one of Kenya's largest private airlines that they had set up a few years earlier. Speaking to the media for the first time about the mission, Anshuur told the BBC that the Nigerian diplomat came "straight to the point", asking him and Hussein "to charter an aircraft and secretly transport the body" from Nigeria's main city of Lagos, to Barre's hometown of Garbaharey in southern Somalia for burial, on the other side of Africa, a distance of some 4,300 km (2,700 miles). Anshuur said they were stunned at the request: "We knew immediately this wasn't a normal charter." Barre had fled Somalia on 28 January 1991 after being overthrown by militia forces, so returning his body was politically fraught, involving multiple governments, fragile regional relations and the risk of a diplomatic fallout. Anshuur said they were fearful of the possible repercussions as the diplomat asked for the flight to be organised outside normal procedures. "If the Kenyan authorities found out, it could have caused serious problems," Anshuur said. The pilots spent the rest of the day debating whether to accept the request, carefully weighing the risks, particularly if the Kenyan government, then led by President Daniel arap Moi, discovered what they were planning to do. Barre seized power in a bloodless coup in 1969. His supporters saw him as a pan-Africanist, who supported causes such as the campaign against the racist system of apartheid in South Africa. To his critics, he was a dictator who oversaw numerous human rights abuses until he was driven from power. Barre initially fled to Kenya, but Moi's government came under intense pressure from parliament and rights groups for hosting him. Barre was then given political asylum by Nigeria, then under military ruler Gen Ibrahim Babangida, and lived in Lagos until he died of a diabetes-related illness. Given the sensitivity of the mission, the pilots asked the Nigerian diplomat to give them one more day to think about his request. The financial offer was lucrative - they didn't want to reveal the exact amount - but the risks were considerable. "We first advised him to use a Nigerian Air Force aircraft, but he refused," Anshuur recalled. "He said that the operation was too sensitive and that the Kenyan government must not be informed." Also speaking to the media for the first time about the mission, the former Somali ruler's son, Ayaanle Mohamed Siad Barre, told the BBC that "the secrecy wasn't about hiding anything illegal". He explained that Islamic tradition requires a burial to take place as soon as possible, and therefore normal procedures were circumvented, though some governments were aware of the plan. "Time was against us," he said. "If we had gone through all the paperwork, it would have delayed the burial." He said he was told by Nigerian officials that Garbaharey's runway was "too small" for a military aircraft. "That's why Bluebird Aviation was contacted," Barre's son told the BBC. The pilots had no contact with Barre's family at the time, and relayed their decision to the Nigerian diplomat, Anshuur said, on 10 January 1995. "It wasn't an easy choice," Anshuur recalled. "But we felt the responsibility to execute the trip." This was not their first connection to the former president. When Barre and his family fled the capital Mogadishu, he arrived in Burdubo, a town in the same region as Garbaharey. During that period, the pilots had flown essential supplies - including food, medicine and other basic necessities - to Burdubo for the Barre family. But before embarking on the journey with Barre's body, the pilots demanded guarantees from the Nigerian government. "That if anything goes wrong politically, Nigeria must take responsibility," Anshuur said. "And we wanted two embassy officials on board." Nigeria agreed. The pilots then designed a plan to ensure their mission remained a secret - and succeeded. Just after 03:00 on 11 January, Anshuur said their small plane, a Beechcraft King Air B200, took off from Wilson Airport. The pilots filed a flight manifest listing Kisumu, a lakeside city in western Kenya, as their destination. "That was only on paper," Anshuur said. "When we got close to Kisumu, we switched off the radar and diverted to Entebbe in Uganda." At the time, radar coverage across much of the region was limited, a gap the pilots knew they could exploit. Upon landing in Entebbe, the pilots told airport authorities the aircraft had arrived from Kisumu. The two Nigerian officials on board were instructed to remain silent and not to disembark. The plane was refuelled, and Yaoundé in Cameroon, was declared as the next destination, where Nigerian diplomats helping to coordinate the operation were waiting, Anshuur told the BBC After a brief stop, the aircraft continued to Lagos. Before entering Nigerian airspace, the Nigerian government instructed the pilots to use a Nigerian Air Force call sign "WT 001" to avoid any suspicion. "That detail mattered," Anshuur said. "Without it, we might have been questioned." They arrived at around 13:00 on 11 January in Lagos, where Barre's family was waiting. After resting for the rest of the day, the pilots prepared for the final leg of the journey - taking Barre's body to Garbaharey in Somalia. On 12 January 1995, his wooden casket was loaded on to the aircraft. The two Nigerian government officials were also on the flight, this time with six members of the family, including his son Ayaanle Mohamed Siad Barre. From the pilots' perspective, secrecy remained essential. "At no point did we tell airport authorities in Cameroon, Uganda or Kenya that we were carrying a body," Hussein said. "That was deliberate." The aircraft retraced its route, stopping briefly in Yaoundé before flying to Entebbe, where it refuelled. The Ugandan authorities were told the final destination was Kisumu in western Kenya. As they neared Kisumu, the pilots diverted, this time flying directly to Garbaharey. Anshuur said after the casket was offloaded, he and his co-pilot attended the burial and then departed for Wilson Airport, with the two Nigerian officials on board. Anshuur said this turned out to be "the most stressful" part of their entire trip. "You think: 'This is where we could be stopped.'" Fearing being caught, the pilots informed Wilson air traffic control that they were arriving from Mandera in north-eastern Kenya, giving the impression that it was a local flight. "No-one asked questions," Anshuur said. "That's when we knew we were safe." With that, the mission was over. "Only afterwards did it really sink in what we had done," Anshuur told the BBC. Asked whether he would do it again, he replied: "I am 65 years old now and no, I would not carry out a similar mission today because aviation technology has improved so much that there is now sufficient air traffic radar coverage within the African continent. "It is virtually impossible to exploit the gaps in air traffic control that existed way back in 1995." More BBC stories on Somalia: Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

'How do we look Indian?': Student's killing puts spotlight on racism in India The northern Indian city of Dehradun, located in the Himalayan foothills, was shaken by a violent incident weeks ago. Brothers Anjel and Michael Chakma - students who had migrated more than 1,500 miles from the north-eastern state of Tripura for studies - had gone to a market on 9 December when they were confronted by a group of men, who allegedly abused them with racial slurs, their father Tarun Chakma told the BBC. When the brothers protested, they were attacked. Michael Chakma was allegedly struck on the head with a metal bracelet, while Anjel Chakma suffered stab wounds. Michael has recovered but Anjel died 17 days later in hospital, he says. Police in Uttarakhand state (whose capital is Dehradun) have arrested five people in connection with the incident, but they have denied that the attack was racially motivated - a claim that Chakma's family strongly disputes. The incident, which has triggered protests in several cities, has put the spotlight on allegations of racism faced by people from India's north-eastern states when they move to larger cities for education or work. They say they are often mocked over their appearance, questioned about nationality and harassed in public spaces and workplaces. For many, the discrimination extends beyond abuse to everyday barriers that shape where and how they live. People from the region report difficulty renting accommodation, with landlords refusing tenants because of their appearance, food habits or stereotypes. Such pressures have led many north-eastern migrants in large cities to cluster in specific neighbourhoods, offering safety, mutual support and cultural familiarity far from home. But while many say they learn to endure everyday prejudices to build lives elsewhere in the country, violent crimes such as Anjel Chakma's killing are deeply unsettling. They reinforce fears about personal safety and a sense of vulnerability, they say. India has seen many high-profile cases of racial violence involving people from the north-eastern region over the last several years. The killing of Nido Tania in 2014 became a national flashpoint, prompting protests and widespread debate about racism after the 20-year-old student from Arunachal Pradesh state was beaten to death in Delhi following taunts about his appearance. But activists say it did not mark an end to such violence. Rights groups say there are many such incidents that do not grab national attention. "Unfortunately, the racism faced by people from the north-east tends to be highlighted only when something extremely violent happens," said Suhas Chakma, director of the Delhi-based Rights and Risks Analysis Group. The federal government in its annual crime reports does not maintain separate data for racial violence. For Ambika Phonglo from the north-eastern Assam state, who lives and works in the capital, Anjel Chakma's killing has been deeply unsettling. "Our facial features like narrow eyes and flat noses make us easy targets of racism," she says. Phonglo recalls being subjected to racial name-calling by colleagues during a workplace discussion a few years ago. "You face it and learn to move on," she says, "but not without carrying a heavy burden of trauma." Mary Wahlang, from neighbouring state of Meghalaya, said she decided to return home after college in the southern state of Karnataka, abandoning plans to seek work in larger cities, after repeated racial name-calling by classmates. "Over time I realised that some people used these slurs without understanding they were racial or hurtful, while others did so despite knowing the consequences," she says. Such experiences, activists say, are not isolated, with many from north-eastern states describing racial taunts and everyday discrimination as a routine part of life in workplaces, campuses and public spaces across the country's major cities. While awareness about the north-eastern region and the racism people from there face have improved over the years, casual racism persists, they say. "How do we look Indian enough? Sadly, there are no clear answers," says Alana Golmei, member of a monitoring committee set up by the federal government in 2018 in the wake of increasing complaints of racial violence in Indian cities. She says that dismissing such attacks as isolated incidents unrelated to racism only deepens the problem. "One has to first accept and acknowledge the issue to begin addressing it," Golmei told the BBC. The killing of Anjel Chakma has renewed calls for a specific anti-racism law. Several student and civil society groups have issued open letters demanding legal reform. After Nido Tania's death in 2014, the Indian government set up a committee to examine discrimination faced by people from the north-east living outside of the region. The panel submitted its report to the home ministry the same year, acknowledging widespread racism and recommending several measures, including a standalone anti-racism law, fast-track investigations and institutional safeguards. But activists say little has changed since. No specific anti-racism legislation has been enacted, and many of the recommendations remain only partially implemented. The BBC has sought clarification from the federal government, but they are yet to respond. The renewed demands over an anti-racism law have revived a broader debate over whether legislation can address prejudice, often seen as rooted in social behaviour. Experts and activists such as Chakma and Golmei argue that it can. They cite laws criminalising dowry and caste-based atrocities, arguing that while these haven't ended abuse, they have empowered victims and raised awareness. "An anti-racism law could empower victims, improve reporting and place racial abuse clearly within the scope of criminal accountability," Golmei said. Meanwhile in Tripura, Tarun Chakma mourns his elder son while facing uncertainty over his younger one: Michael, a final-year sociology student, is expected to return to Dehradun to complete his studies. While family members have urged caution, Tarun Chakma says he is torn between fear for his son's safety and the belief that abandoning his education would amount to another loss. "At the end of the day, higher education for a better future was the reason for which we had sent our sons so far away from home," he says.
