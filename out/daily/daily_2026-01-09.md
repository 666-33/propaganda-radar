**Excerpt**

Iran leader says anti-government protesters are vandals trying to please Trump Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has called anti-government protesters "troublemakers" and "a bunch of vandals" just trying "to please the president of the US". He accused crowds of destroying buildings because Donald Trump said he "supports you". Trump has warned Iran that if it kills protesters, the US would "hit" the country "very hard". The protests, in their 13th day, erupted over the economy and have grown into the largest in years - leading to calls for an end to the Islamic Republic and some urging the restoration of the monarchy. At least 48 protesters and 14 security personnel, have been killed, according to human rights groups. An internet blackout is in place. Khamenei remained defiant in a televised address on Friday. "Let everyone know that the Islamic Republic came to power through the blood of several hundred thousand honourable people and it will not back down in the face of those who deny this," the 86-year-old said. Since protests began on 28 December, in addition to the 48 protesters killed, more than 2,277 individuals have also been arrested, the US-based Human Rights Activist News Agency (HRANA) said. The Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHRNGO) said at least 51 protesters, including nine children, had been killed. BBC Persian has spoken to the families of 22 of them and confirmed their identities. The BBC and most other international news organisations are barred from reporting inside Iran. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps issued a statement on Friday saying it would not tolerate the continuation of the current situation in the country. Reza Pahlavi, the son of Iran's last shah who was overthrown by the 1979 Islamic revolution, called on Trump on Friday to "be prepared to intervene to help the people of Iran". Pahlavi, who lives close to Washington DC, had urged protesters to take to the streets on Thursday and Friday. Protests have taken place across the country, with BBC Verify verifying videos from 67 locations. On Friday, protesters amassed after weekly prayers in the south-eastern city of Zahedan, videos verified by BBC Persian and BBC Verify show. In one of the videos, people can be heard chanting "death to the dictator", referencing Khamenei. In another, protesters gather near a local mosque, when several loud bangs can be heard. Another verified video from Thursday showed a fire at the office of the Young Journalists Club, a subsidiary of state broadcaster Irib, in the city of Isfahan. It is unclear what caused the fire and if anyone was injured. Photos received by the BBC from Thursday night also show cars overturned and set alight at Tehran's Kaaj roundabout. The country has been under a near-total internet blackout since Thursday evening, with minor amounts of traffic returning on Friday, internet monitoring groups Cloudfare and Netblocks said. That means less information is emerging from Iran. IHRNGO director Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam said in a statement that "the extent of the government's use of force against protesters has been increasing, and the risk of intensified violence and the widespread killing of protesters after the internet shutdown is very serious". Nobel laureate Shirin Ebadi has warned of a possible "massacre" during the internet shutdown. One person who was able to send a message to the BBC said he was in Shiraz, in southern Iran. He reported a run on supermarkets by residents trying to stock up on food and other essentials, expecting worse days to come. The shutdown of the internet has meant that cash machines are not working, and there is no way to pay for purchases in shops where debit cards cannot be used due to the lack of internet. Mahsa Alimardani, who works for the human rights NGO Witness, told the BBC in London that she had not been able to make contact with her family since Thursday evening. "It's very anxiety-inducing, not having access to information, not knowing if your loved ones participated [in the protests] or if they're okay," she said. The protests began nearly two weeks ago with shopkeepers in Tehran angry about the collapsing currency, before spreading to students and street demonstrations. The last major protests were in 2022, when demonstrations erupted after the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish woman who was detained by morality police for allegedly not wearing her hijab properly. More than 550 people were killed and 20,000 detained by security forces over several months, according to human rights groups. Additional reporting by Reha Kansara and Kasra Naji

Video emerges of Minneapolis shooting filmed by ICE agent who opened fire A video filmed by the US immigration agent who fatally shot a woman in Minneapolis on Wednesday has emerged, showing the moments before gunfire rang out. The 47-second footage, obtained by Minnesota-based outlet Alpha News, shows Renee Nicole Good sitting behind the wheel of her car and speaking to the officer. US Vice-President JD Vance shared the clip on social media, commenting that the agent had acted in self-defence. Local officials have insisted the woman posed no danger. Good's wife has paid tribute to the 37-year-old, saying the pair were trying to support their neighbours when she was shot. Her death has sparked protests across the US. President Donald Trump's administration says Good tried to run over the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent after blocking the road and impeding their work. The BBC has asked the homeland security department and the White House for comment on the new video that emerged on Friday. The footage starts with the officer getting out of his car and filming Good's vehicle while he walks around it. A dog is in the backseat. Good says: "That's fine dude. I'm not mad at you." A second woman, thought to be her wife, is standing on the street filming the interaction with her mobile phone. She appears to tell the ICE agent: "We don't change our plates every morning... just so you know, it will be the same plate when you come talk to us later." She adds: "Do you want to come at us? I say go and get yourself some lunch, big boy." Another agent approaches Good on the driver's side and uses an expletive as he says: "Get out of the car." The agent filming the clip moves in front of Good's car as she reverses. In a chaotic couple of seconds, she turns the wheel to the right and pulls forwards. The camera jerks up to the sky. "Woah, woah!" a voice says, as bangs are heard. In the final part of the video the car is seen veering down the road. The ICE agent swears. Other videos released previously from the scene shows the ICE agents around the vehicle remaining standing as the maroon SUV crashed into the side of the road. The FBI is investigating the incident. When asked about the video at the White House on Friday, President Trump said: "You have agitators and we will always be protecting ICE, and we're always going to be protecting our border patrol and our law enforcement." On Friday, Vance reposted the video on X, and defended the agent's actions, saying: "The reality is that his life was endangered and he fired in self-defence." White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt also reposted the video, saying the media had smeared an ICE agent who had "properly defended himself from being run over". Good's wife, Becca Good, told local media the pair had gone to the scene of immigration enforcement activity to support neighbours. "We had whistles," she said. "They had guns." When speaking about Good she said "kindness radiated out of her". "We were raising our son to believe that no matter where you come from or what you look like, all of us deserve compassion and kindness," she added. A row erupted on Thursday between Minnesota officials and the federal government as the Minnesota's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) said it had been denied access to evidence related to the case. The BCA said the FBI had initially said there would be a joint investigation, but then changed their stance. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, a Democrat, has accused the Trump administration of blocking state officials, but Vice-President Vance said the investigation was a federal issue. Previously, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem had alleged the ICE agent shot Good because she was trying to run over the officer in her car. But Democratic Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey called that account a false narrative, saying it was clear to him Good was trying to leave the scene, not attack an agent. In Minneapolis and other US cities on Thursday night, demonstrators took part in a second night of protests against the killing of Good. Marches took place in Houston, Cincinnati, Washington DC, Philadelphia and other cities, with some protesters holding placards calling for the abolition of ICE. Governor Walz said he had activated the state's National Guard to help with security of the protests.

**Excerpt**

Owner of Swiss ski bar held in custody after deadly New Year's Eve fire One of the two co-owners of the Swiss bar where 40 people died in a fire on New Year's Eve has been detained. Swiss prosecutors said Jacques Moretti, a French national, was a potential flight risk. He and his wife Jessica, who is also French, are suspected of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence. The blaze at Le Constellation bar in Crans-Montana left 116 people injured. Many of the victims were aged under 20. The fire is believed to have been started by sparklers in champagne bottles raised too close to the ceiling during celebrations. It emerged this week that the bar in the popular ski resort had not undergone safety checks for five years. The decision to detain Jacques Moretti came after he and his wife, Jessica, who own the bar together, were on Friday questioned by prosecutors in Sion, a town in the canton of Valais. Under Swiss law, the subject of an investigation is kept in custody until a court decision is made within 48 hours. The couple had been earlier placed under criminal investigation. On Friday, Jessica Moretti told reporters: "My constant thoughts go to the victims and those who are fighting today. "This was an unthinkable tragedy and never could we have imagined this. It happened in our bar and I want to say I'm sorry," she added as she walked through the streets of Sion surrounded by police. The co-owners had earlier said they were "devastated", pledging "full co-operation" with the ongoing investigation. The prosecutors have said they believe the fire started when people celebrating the New Year raised champagne bottles with sparklers attached, setting light to sound-insulating foam on the ceiling of the basement bar. On Friday, Switzerland staged a minute's silence on a national day of mourning for the victims of the fire. Church bells then rang across the country for five minutes. Trains and trams came to a halt and Zurich airport briefly paused operations. At a local commemoration staged in Crans-Montana, there was a standing ovation for firefighters. The news that the bar had not been inspected for five years has shocked families of the victims. Romain Jordan, who represents some of the families, said earlier this week the "staggering number of breaches and shortcomings in the inspections raises the question of whether the municipality should be investigated with even greater urgency". Venues like Le Constellation should have been checked annually, but Crans-Montana Mayor Nicolas Feraud said on Tuesday he could not explain why this had not been done for so long at that bar. "We regret that - we owe it to the families and we will accept the responsibility," he said. He added that sparklers would be banned in local venues. Most of the victims of the fire were young - eight were under the age of 16. Many of the injured have severe burns and are being treated in Switzerland and other European countries. The funerals of some of those who died have been taking place.

**Excerpt**

Trump says US needs to 'own' Greenland to prevent Russia and China from taking it President Donald Trump says the US needs to "own" Greenland to prevent Russia and China from doing so. "Countries have to have ownership and you defend ownership, you don't defend leases and we'll have to defend Greenland," Trump told reporters on Friday. We will do it "the easy way" or "the hard way", Trump said - a comment that follows recent statements by the White House that the administration is considering buying the semi-autonomous territory of fellow Nato country Denmark, but not removing the option of annexing it to the US by force. Denmark and Greenland say the territory is not for sale. Denmark has said military action would spell the end of the trans-Atlantic defence alliance. Despite being the most sparsely populated territory, Greenland's location between North America and the Arctic makes it well placed for early warning systems in the event of missile attacks, and for monitoring vessels in the region. The US president has repeatedly said that Greenland is vital to US national security, claiming without evidence that it was "covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place". The US already has more than 100 military personnel permanently stationed at its Pituffik base in Greenland's north-western tip - a facility that has been operated by the US since World War Two. Under existing agreements with Denmark, the US has the power to bring as many troops as it wants to Greenland. But speaking to reporters in Washington, Trump said a lease agreement was not good enough. "Countries can't make nine-year deals or even 100-year deals," he said, adding that they had to have ownership. "I love the people of China. I love the people of Russia," Trump said. "But I don't want them as a neighbour in Greenland, not going to happen." "And by the way Nato's got to understand that," the US president added. Denmark's Nato allies - major European countries as well as Canada - have rallied to its support this week with statements reaffirming that "only Denmark and Greenland can decide on matters concerning their relations". Stressing they were as keen as the US on Arctic security, they have said this must be achieved by allies, including the US, "collectively". They also called for "upholding the principles of the UN Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders". Concerns over the future of the territory resurfaced after Trump's use of military force against Venezuela on Saturday to seize its president, Nicolás Maduro. Trump previously made an offer to buy the island in 2019, during his first presidential term, only to be told it was not for sale. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio is to hold talks with Denmark next week. In recent years, there has also been increased interest in Greenland's natural resources - including rare earth minerals, uranium and iron - which are becoming easier to access as its ice melts due to climate change. Scientists think it could also have significant oil and gas reserves.

**Excerpt**

Trump's Venezuela oil meeting starts with few concrete promises US President Donald Trump met with oil executives in Washington on Friday, as he pushed for major investments in Venezuela. But no major financial commitments were immediately forthcoming from the meeting, with the head of ExxonMobil warning the South American country was currently "un-investable". Trump has said he expects big oil companies to direct "at least" $100bn (£75bn) toward the country, but industry analysts have warned many companies will be reluctant to go into a situation that still carries significant risk. Last week the US seized Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, who is now being held in jail in New York. Maduro's second-in-command, vice president Delcy Rodríguez, who is seen as more of a pragmatist, is now interim president. Executives of the biggest US oil majors who attended the meeting acknowledged that the country, which is sitting on vast proven oil reserves, represents a major opportunity. But at a press conference with Trump they warned they would need to see significant changes inside Venezuela, as well as a welcome from the local government and its people, to make it an attractive place to put money. "We have had our assets seized there twice and so you can imagine to re-enter a third time would require some pretty significant changes from what we've historically seen and what is currently the state," Exxon's chief executive Darren Woods said. "Today it's un-investable." Venezuela has had a complicated relationship with international oil firms since oil was discovered in its territory more than 100 years ago. Chevron is the last remaining major American oil firm still operating in the country, while a handful of companies from other countries, including Spain's Repsol and Italy's Eni, both of whom were represented at the White House meeting. Exxon and ConocoPhillips, which was also in attendance, have been fighting to recoup billions in dollars they say they are owed after the 2007 nationalisation of their assets. Trump has alluded to the issue repeatedly this week to justify his intervention, including on Friday, but he downplayed the chances of recovery in the meeting, echoing comment by other administration officials in recent years who said the repayment of those debts was not an immediate priority. "We're not going to go back," Trump said. He said his administration would work to strike a "deal" with companies to bring his vision for reviving the industry to reality. Venezuela sits on top of some of the world's largest reserves. But its production has dropped off sharply in recent decades due to disinvestment and mismanagement - not to mention US sanctions, which have limited its access to the global market. At roughly 1 million barrels per day, the country's production now accounts for less than 1% of global supply. The White House has said it is working to "selectively" roll back those restrictions, but Trump officials have also made clear they intend to exert control over sales of Venezuelan oil, as a way to maintain leverage over the Venezuelan government. The US this week has seized several oil tankers carrying sanctioned crude. US officials have said they are working to set up a sales process, which would deposit money raised into US-controlled accounts. "We are open for business," Trump said. Chevron said it expected to bolster output, building on its current presence, while Exxon said it was working to send in a technical team to assess the situation in the coming weeks. Repsol, which currently boasts output of about 45,000 barrels per day, said it saw a path to triple its production in Venezuela over the next few years under the right conditions. Executives at other firms also said Trump's promises of change would encourage investment and they were hoping to seize the moment. "We are ready to go to Venezuela," said Bill Armstrong, who leads an independent oil and gas driller. "In real estate terms, it is prime real estate." But analysts say meaningfully increasing production would take significant effort. "They are being as polite as humanly possible, and being as supportive as they can, without committing actual dollars," said David Goldwyn, president of the energy consultancy Goldwyn Global Strategies and former US State Department special envoy for international energy affairs. Major oil companies like Exxon and Shell are "not going to invest single digit billions of dollars, much less tens of billions of dollars", without physical security, legal certainty and a competitive fiscal framework, Goldwyn said. "It's not really welcome from an industry point of view," he said. "The conditions are just not right." Still, he added that smaller companies might be more eager to jump in and help boost Venezuela's oil production over the next year. But those investments would likely hover in the $50m range - far from the "fantastical" $100bn figure that Trump has floated. Rystad Energy estimates it would take $8bn to $9bn in new investments per year for production to triple by 2040. Trump's suggested $100bn of investment into Venezuela could have a major impact - if it were to materialise, said the firm's chief economist, Claudio Galimberti. He said companies would only be likely to invest on that scale with subsidies - and political stability. "It's going to be difficult to see big commitments before we have a fully stabilised political situation and that is anybody's guess when that happens," he said.

**Excerpt**

US seizes fifth oil tanker linked to Venezuela, officials say US forces have seized another tanker in the Caribbean Sea, officials say, as the Trump administration continues its efforts to control exports of Venezuelan oil. The tanker, the Olina, is on multiple countries' sanctions lists and the fifth vessel to be seized by the US in recent weeks. The US is using the seizures to pressure Venezuela's interim government and remove the so-called dark fleet of tankers from service. Officials say this fleet consists of more than 1,000 vessels that transport sanctioned and illicit oil. "Once again, our joint interagency forces sent a clear message this morning: 'there is no safe haven for criminals,'" said the US military's Southern Command on Friday. The vessel reportedly left Venezuelan waters late on Sunday, after the US seized President Nicolás Maduro in an early morning raid. Officials said Friday's operation was carried out before dawn by Marines and sailors in coordination with the Department of Homeland Security, and that it was seized after it "departed Venezuela attempting to evade US forces". Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote on X that it was "another 'ghost fleet' tanker ship suspected of carrying embargoed oil". Noem also shared a video appearing to show troops dropping onto a ship from a helicopter, and described the operation as "safe" and "effective". Maritime risk company Vanguard Tech said the vessel was attempting to break through the US naval blockade in the Caribbean. It had been sailing under a false flag registered to Timor-Leste, according to the International Maritime Organization. Vanguard Tech added that the vessel's location tracker was last active 52 days ago, northeast of Curacao, and that "the seizure follows a prolonged pursuit of tankers linked to sanctioned Venezuelan oil shipments in the region". The US had sanctioned the Olina last January, then named Minerva M, accusing it of helping finance Russia's war in Ukraine by moving Russian oil to foreign markets. Earlier this week, the US said it seized two other tankers linked to Venezuelan oil exports in "back-to-back" operations in the North Atlantic and Caribbean. One of them was the Russian-flagged Marinera seized with the help of the UK Royal Navy, which gave logistical support by air and sea. The Marinera is allegedly part of shadow fleet carrying oil for Venezuela, Russia and Iran, breaking US sanctions. US officials said that Marinera was falsely flying the flag of Guyana last month, which made it stateless. US authorities alleged the second tanker - the M/T Sophia - was "conducting illicit activities". Experts have told BBC Verify that under UN international maritime law, authorities can board a stateless vessel. President Donald Trump says Venezuela - which has the world's largest proven oil reserves - "will be turning over" up to 50 million barrels of oil worth some $2.8bn (£2.1bn) to the US. The oil, according to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, would be sold "in the marketplace at market rates" and that the US would control how the proceeds were dispersed "in a way that benefits the Venezuelan people". Meanwhile on Friday, US diplomats visited the Venezuelan capital, Caracas, to assess the possibility of re-opening an embassy in the Latin American country. Diplomatic ties between the US and Venezuela were severed by Maduro in 2019. The new Venezuelan authorities have said they're engaged in exploratory talks on restoring relations.

**Excerpt**

X could face UK ban over deepfakes, minister says Technology Secretary Liz Kendall says she would back regulator Ofcom if it blocks UK access to Elon Musk's social media site X for failing to comply with online safety laws. Ofcom says it is urgently deciding what to do about X's artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot Grok, which digitally undressed people without their consent when tagged beneath images posted on the platform. X has now limited the use of this image function to those who pay a monthly fee. But Downing Street said the change was "insulting" to victims of sexual violence. Musk said on X the UK government "want any excuse for censorship" as he replied to a post questioning why other AI platforms were not being looked at. Kendall said: "Sexually manipulating images of women and children is despicable and abhorrent. She added: "I, and more importantly the public, would expect to see Ofcom update on next steps in days not weeks." She said the Online Safety Act "includes the power to block services from being accessed in the UK, if they refuse to comply with UK law" and "if Ofcom decide to use those powers they will have our full support". The BBC has approached X for comment. An Ofcom spokesperson said: "We urgently made contact [with X] on Monday and set a firm deadline of today [Friday] to explain themselves, to which we have received a response." "We're now undertaking an expedited assessment as a matter of urgency and will provide further updates shortly." Ofcom's powers under the Online Safety Act include being able to seek a court order to prevent third parties from helping X raise money or be accessed in the UK - should the firm refuse to comply. These so-called business disruption measures remain largely untested. The use of Grok to generate non-consensual sexualised images has been condemned by politicians on all sides, with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer calling it "disgraceful" and "disgusting". Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said it was "horrible in every way" and that X "needs to go further" than the changes it had made to Grok earlier on Friday. But he said the idea of banning X in the UK was "frankly appalling" and an attack on free speech. The Liberal Democrats have called for access to X to be temporarily restricted in the UK while the social media site was investigated. 'Humiliated and dehumanised' Grok is a free tool which users can tag directly in posts or replies under other users' posts to ask it for a particular response. The tool can still edit images on X if accessed through other areas of the platform, such as via its in-built "edit image" function, or on its separate app and website. Many requests have been made asking it to edit images of women to show them in bikinis or little clothing - something those subject to such requests have told the BBC left them feeling "humiliated" and "dehumanised". However as of Friday morning, Grok has told users asking it to alter images uploaded to X that "image generation and editing are currently limited to paying subscribers", adding users "can subscribe to unlock these features". Some posts on the platform seen by BBC News suggest only those with a blue tick "verified" mark - exclusive to X's paid subscriber tier - were able to successfully request image edits to Grok. Dr Daisy Dixon, a lecturer in philosophy at Cardiff University and female X user who said she had seen an increase in people using Grok to undress her, welcomed the change but said it felt "like a sticking plaster". "Grok needs to be totally redesigned and have built-in ethical guardrails to prevent this from ever happening again," she told the BBC. "Elon Musk also needs to acknowledge this for what it is - yet another instance of gender-based violation." Hannah Swirsky, head of policy at the Internet Watch Foundation, said it "does not undo the harm which has been done". "We do not believe it is good enough to simply limit access to a tool which should never have had the capacity to create the kind of imagery we have seen in recent days," she said. The charity previously said its analysts had discovered "criminal imagery" of girls aged between 11 and 13 which "appeared to have been created" using Grok. Labour MPs are increasingly unhappy with the party's use of X to get its political messages out. Leaked messages from the Parliamentary Labour Party's WhatsApp group, used to post announcements for backbench Labour MPs to share on social media, show at least 13 Labour MPs have called on the government to stop using the platform. The messages, first reported by Politics Home and seen by BBC News, show Labour MPs calling on the government to "take a stand" and "put our messages out in other places". One MP said: "As some of us have requested since Musk went all fascist, rather than X, our government should start using another platform". Another said: "Any images of children (and women) in government comms on X put those children in harms way." Earlier on Friday, Downing Street suggested that the government would continue posting on X. The prime minister's official spokesperson told reporters changes to the way Grok complied with user requests to edit images on the platform showed X "can move swiftly when it wants to". They said it was "abundantly clear that X needs to act and needs to act now". "It is time for X to grip this issue, if another media company had billboards in town centres showing unlawful images, it would act immediately to take them down or face public backlash," they added.

US film stars Meagan Good and Jonathan Majors to become Guinea citizens after DNA tests Husband and wife movie stars Meagan Good and Jonathan Majors have travelled to Guinea, where the US couple are due to be granted citizenship after tracing their ancestry to the West African nation through DNA testing. "We are just happy to be here," said Good, best known for the film Think Like a Man, and who went on to explain that it was her first visit to Guinea. Majors, a star of Creed and Ant-Man, added: "I am excited to meet the people and go around the town with my wife." Their citizenship ceremony has been organised by the ministry of culture - and is similar to other initiatives in the region to encourage people of African descent to reclaim their heritage and invest in the continent. The event - a private cultural ceremony - is to take place at a new tourist garden on the outskirts of the capital, Conakry later on Friday. Good, 44, and Majors, 36, began dating in May 2023 and tied the knot last year. They married following a turbulent period in Majors' life. In 2024, he was sentenced in the US to probation for assaulting his ex-girlfriend, British choreographer Grace Jabbari. He was mandated to complete a 52-week domestic violence intervention programme. The actors landed at Conakry's Gbessia International Airport in the early hours of Friday morning and were welcomed with great fanfare by officials and musicians. During their stay in Guinea, the pair are scheduled to tour Boké, a coastal region with historic slave trade sites. It is not clear if they plan to invest in or move to Guinea. In recent years, several celebrities have taken up citizenships of countries in Africa. It largely began in 2019 when Ghana launched "The Year of Return", inviting those with African heritage to come home and invest. One of the most prominent stars to do so was Stevie Wonder in 2024. Other notable examples have been US singer Ciara, who took Beninese citizenship last year, and Hollywood actor Samuel L Jackson, who acquired a Gabonese passport in 2020. Guinea itself has a long history of welcoming activists and people from the African diaspora. In the 1960s, South African singer Miriam Makeba and her husband, US civil rights activist and Black Panther leader Stokely Carmichael, moved to Guinea. Makeba had been made stateless for her opposition to apartheid and after her marriage to Carmichael, who popularised the slogan "black power", her US visa was revoked. She was treated as an honorary Guinean citizen and cultural ambassador, while Carmichael, who took the name Kwame Ture, remained in Guinea even after their divorce, dying there in 1998. Guinea has experience political turmoil in recent years - and under the junta that seized power in 2021 the country has become less open to dissent. Coup leader Gen Mamady Doumbouya restricted the media and suppressed protests. The country has recently returned to civilian rule following elections last month, won by Doumbouya with 87% of the vote. Unlike other countries in the region that have experienced recent coups, Guinea has maintained relations with Western governments, particularly France. The country is rich in minerals, including bauxite, iron ore, diamonds, gold and uranium, yet its people remain among the poorest in West Africa.

EU reaches South America trade deal after 25 years of talks The EU has reached a free trade agreement with South American countries, 25 years after talks began and despite opposition from farmers in several European countries. The deal with the Mercosur trading bloc - which includes Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay - will require the approval of the European parliament within the next few months Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva hailed it as a "historic day for multilateralism" after the four South American countries put the final touches to the deal in Brussels. It comes against the backdrop of US President Donald Trump's tariffs on countries around the world and his recent military intervention in Venezuela. The EU heralded what will be its largest free trade accord to date as a "win-win", although critics have argued that cheap imports may undercut European farmers in products including beef, poultry and sugar. "In an international scenario of growing protectionism and unilateralism, the agreement is a signal in favour of international trade as a driver of economic growth, with benefits for both blocs," President Lula posted on X. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the deal will "bring meaningful benefits to consumers and businesses, on both sides". Farmers in several countries in Europe held last-ditch protests against the deal, with marches and demonstrations using tractors in France and Belgium. "There is a lot of pain," Judy Peeters, a representative for a Belgian young farmers' group, told AFP at a protest on a motorway south of Brussels. "There is a lot of anger." Von der Leyen said the Commission had listened to the concerns of farmers, and had acted on them including through introducing "robust safeguards" to protect their livelihoods in the agreement. As well as boosting trade and political ties, the European Commission said the deal would help fight climate change, through commitments to halt deforestation and ensure a "reliable" flow of raw materials, critical for the global green transition. The Commission expects the deal to save local companies €4bn ($4.7bn, £3.5bn) a year in export duties. South American countries boast deposits of gold, copper and some of the critical minerals required for renewable and battery technology. Cecilia Malmström, a former European commissioner for trade who led EU trade negotiations for five years, told World Business Express on BBC World Service that parts of the trade agreement could be suspended if Mercosur countries failed to stick to their commitments around environmental protection. "[This agreement] is also a very strong geopolitical signal today to other powers who do not appreciate rule-based trade in the same way as we do," she said. On Friday afternoon a broad majority of EU member states confirmed their support for the free trade agreement, but it will still require approval from the European Parliament before it can take effect. Jack Allen-Reynolds, deputy chief Euro-zone economist for Capital Economics, said voting was expected to be close in the parliament. However, he said the larger issue was how much of an impact the deal would have, and pointed to the Commission's own estimate that it would raise EU economic output by just 0.05%. "The bigger point though is that even if the agreement is eventually implemented, it will be macroeconomically insignificant," he said. "And because it will be phased in over 15 years, these benefits won't arrive until 2040 at the earliest."

**Excerpt**

Colombia sees 'real threat' of US military action, president tells BBC Colombia's President Gustavo Petro has told the BBC that he believes there is now a "real threat" of US military action against Colombia. Petro said the US is treating other nations as part of a US "empire". It comes after Trump said a military operation in Colombia "sounds good". Petro said that the US risks transforming from "dominating the world" to becoming "isolated from the world." He also accused US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents of acting like "Nazi brigades". Trump has significantly expanded ICE operations as part of what the administration says is a crackdown on crime and immigrants who illegally entered the US. The BBC has approached the White House for comment. Following US strikes on Venezuela and the seizure of Nicolás Maduro, US President Donald Trump said a military operation targeting Colombia "sounds good". Trump has also repeatedly told Petro to "watch his ass", remarks Petro strongly condemned. Trump and Petro spoke by phone on Wednesday evening, after which Trump said he would meet his Colombian counterpart at the White House in the "near future. Writing on his Truth Social platform late on Wednesday after the call, Trump described his conversation with Petro as a "Great Honour". A Colombian official said at the time that the conversation had reflected a 180-degree shift in rhetoric "from both sides." But on Thursday, Petro's tone suggested relations had not significantly improved. He told the BBC the call lasted just under an hour, "most of it occupied by me," and covered "drug trafficking Colombia" and Colombia's view on Venezuela and "what is happening around Latin America regarding the United States." Petro strongly criticised recent US immigration enforcement, accusing ICE agents of operating like "Nazi brigades". Trump has accused countries like Colombia and Venezuela of not doing enough to tackle drug-trafficking. The US has conducted more than 30 strikes in recent months on vessels that the US says were being used for drug trafficking in the Caribbean and the Pacific, killing more than 110 people. Trump told Fox News host Sean Hannity in an interview that aired on Thursday night that after targeting drug trafficking by water "we are going to start now hitting land", adding that "the cartels are running Mexico". Trump has often blamed immigration for crime and trafficking in the US, using it to justify large-scale enforcement operations. Since returning to the White House, the US president has sent ICE agents to cities across the country. The agency enforces immigration laws and conducts investigations into undocumented immigration. It also plays a role in removing undocumented immigrants from the US. The administration says it deported 605,000 people between 20 January and 10 December 2025. It also said 1.9 million immigrants had "voluntarily self-deported", following an aggressive public awareness campaign encouraging people to leave the country on their own to avoid arrest or detention. About 65,000 people were in ICE detention as of 30 November 2025, according to data obtained by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse's immigration project, a compendium of government data from Syracuse University. This week a US immigration agent shot dead a 37-year-old US citizen in the city of Minneapolis, sparking protests overnight. Federal officials said the woman, Renee Nicole Good, had tried to run over immigration agents with her car but the city mayor, Democrat Jacob Frey, said the agent who shot her had acted recklessly and demanded agents leave the city. Petro said ICE had "reached the point where it no longer only persecutes Latin Americans in the streets, which for us is an affront, but it also kills United States citizens." He added that if this continued, "instead of a United States dominating the world – an imperial dream – it is a United States isolated from the world. An empire was not built by being isolated from the world." Petro said the US has for "decades" treated other governments, particularly in Latin America, as an "empire" regardless of the law. The two leaders have long been adversaries, frequently trading insults and tariff threats on social media. Following the US's military action in Venezuela, Petro accused Washington of seeking wars over "oil and coal," adding that if the US had not pulled out of the Paris Agreement, where countries agreed to limit global temperature rising by reducing fossil fuel use, "there would be no wars, there would be a much more democratic and peaceful relationship with the world. And South America." "The Venezuelan issue is about this," he said. After Trump's comments threatening military action in Colombia, demonstrations were held across the country in the name of sovereignty and democracy. Petro told the BBC that Trump's remarks amounted to a "real threat", citing Colombia's loss of territory such as Panama in the 20th century, and said "the prospect of removing [the threat] depends on the ongoing conversations." Asked how Colombia would defend itself in the event of a US attack, Petro said he would "prefer it to be about dialogue." He said that "work is being done" on this. But he added: "Colombia's history shows how it has responded to large armies." "It's not about confronting a large army with weapons we don't have. We don't even have anti-aircraft defenses. Instead, we rely on the masses, our mountains, and our jungles, as we always have." Petro confirmed he had also spoken to Delcy Rodríguez, Venezuela's acting president and former vice president and oil minister, and invited her to Colombia. He said Venezuela had "long been subject to interference by various intelligence agencies," adding that while such agencies had permission to operate in Colombia, it was solely to combat drug trafficking. He denounced attempts at what he said were other "covert operations" in Colombia. He did not directly comment when asked whether he feared the CIA could carry out covert operations similar to their actions in Venezuela in Colombia, or whether he feared his own government or inner circles may have informants. Maduro was captured by the US army's Delta Force, the military's top counter-terrorism unit, after a CIA source in Venezuelan government helped the US track his location. As the world's largest producer of cocaine, Colombia is a major hub for the global drug trade. It also has significant oil reserves, as well as gold, silver, emeralds, platinum and coal. The US has said it will control sales of Venezuelan oil "indefinitely" as it prepares to roll back restrictions on the country's crude in global markets. Speaking aboard Air Force One after the Venezuela operation, Trump described Petro as a "sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States," adding: "He's not going to be doing it for very long." Petro denied the claims, saying it has "always been proven that I'm not involved in that." "For 20 years I have been fighting against the drug cartels, at the cost of my family having to go into exile," he said. A former guerrilla, Petro has pursued a "total peace" strategy since taking office, prioritising dialogue with armed groups. Critics say the approach has been too soft, with cocaine production reaching record levels. Asked what failed and whether he accepted responsibility, Petro said coca cultivation growth was slowing and described "two simultaneous approaches." "One, talking about peace with groups that are bandits. And the other, developing a military offensive against those who don't want peace." He said negotiations were ongoing in southern Colombia, "where the greatest reduction in coca leaf cultivation has occurred" and "where the homicide rate in Colombia has fallen the most." Cocaine is made from the leaves of the coca plant. The policy of dialogue, he said, was intended to "de-escalate violence", adding: "we're not fools, we know who we're negotiating with."

Venezuelan government begins releasing political prisoners The Venezuelan government has started releasing detainees considered political prisoners by human rights groups, in what officials described as a goodwill gesture. Spain's foreign ministry said five of its nationals had been released. Among them is prominent Venezuelan-Spanish rights activist, Rocío San Miguel, her family confirmed to US media. The move comes after the US seized Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro in a raid on the capital, Caracas, on Saturday, to face drug trafficking charges in New York. US President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social that the release of political prisoners - which has been a long-held US demand - was "a very important and smart gesture" from Venezuela. Trump added that Venezuela released the prisoners as a sign of "seeking peace" and as a result, he had cancelled a "previously expected second wave of attacks" on the country. Jorge Rodríguez, the head of Venezuela's National Assembly and the brother of its interim president Delcy Rodríguez, announced on state television that "a significant number" would be released immediately, without specifying the number or identity of prisoners being freed. Hundreds of political prisoners are detained in Venezuelan prisons, with only a handful thought to have been released so far. Jorge Rodríguez said the interim government was releasing them in the interest of "national unity and peaceful coexistence". Rocío San Miguel, a vocal critic of Maduro and a defence expert, was the first prisoner confirmed to be freed. Her family told the New York Times that she was taken to the Spanish embassy in Caracas. Arrested in 2024, she was accused of being involved in a plot to kill the then-president and faced charges of treason, conspiracy and terrorism. Her arrest shocked human rights activists and, because her whereabouts were unknown, was labelled as potential "enforced disappearance" by the UN Human Rights Office. Venezuelan human rights organisations - some of which have members or their founders in jail - welcomed the news with caution. Despite being a key lieutenant of Maduro, Delcy Rodríguez's interim administration has appeared willing to co-operate with the US since it took its leader and made sweeping declarations about the South American nation's future. About 50 to 80 prisoners are believed to be held at the notorious El Helicoide prison, which US President Donald Trump announced would be closed following Maduro's capture. The prison gained international notoriety for detaining alleged political opponents, with reports by human rights groups of torture including beatings and electrocution. The announcement also comes shortly after US President Donald Trump stated that he had "given orders to close that prison," which had become one of the most notorious symbols of political repression in the country. Venezuelan human rights group Provea warned El Helicoide's anticipated closure should not deflect attention from the other detention sites still running across the country. Opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado, who has several close allies in prison, has repeatedly demanded releases. In a sit-down interview with the Fox News show Hannity, Trump said Machado was expected to come to the US "next week sometime". Machado told host Sean Hannity earlier in the week that she wanted to give the US president her Nobel Peace Prize. When asked by Hannity whether Trump would accept the offer, he said "that would be a great honour". Venezuela's opposition and human rights groups have said for years the government used detentions to stamp out dissent and silence critics. Since the widely disputed 2024 election, the opposition claimed legal proceedings against activists, journalists and political adversaries increased. Attorney General Tarek Saab and others in the government repeatedly denied Venezuela held political prisoners, arguing those detained were arrested for genuine crimes.

Second night of US protests over ICE shooting of woman in Minneapolis People took to the streets of Minneapolis and other US cities for a second night to protest against the killing of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good, who was shot in her car by a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent. Demonstrators marched in Houston, Cincinnati, Washington DC, Philadelphia and other cities, some with placards calling for the abolition of ICE. People laid floral tributes where Good's car crashed after the shooting, just blocks away from the place where George Floyd was killed in 2020, sparking weeks of national protests. Meanwhile, two people were injured in another shooting involving federal agents, this time border patrol in Portland, Oregon, on Thursday afternoon. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said the Portland incident happened during a traffic stop of a Venezuelan gang member, who "attempted to run over" agents with his car. The Democratic mayor of Portland cast doubt on their account and people gathered on Thursday night at the city's ICE facility to protest. There were six arrests. ICE is taking the lead in carrying out the Trump administration's mass deportation initiative, which was a central promise of Donald Trump's election campaign. Officials have offered differing accounts of the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good in Minnesota, with the Trump administration claiming the ICE agent was acting in self defence, while local officials say the woman posed no danger. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation said it would investigate the incident. A row between Minnesota officials and the federal government over control of the investigation deepened on Thursday. Minnesota's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) said the FBI had initially agreed to a joint investigation with state officials, but then reversed course and denied the state access to materials and evidence. Without the ability to access all the necessary case materials and evidence, the BCA has "reluctantly withdrawn" from the investigation, the BCA's superintendent Drew Evans said in a statement. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz accused the Trump administration of blocking state officials from involvement in the case, but US Vice-President JD Vance said the investigation is a federal issue. Videos of the incident show ICE agents approaching a car which is in the middle of the street, and telling the woman behind the wheel to get out of the SUV. One of the agents tugs at the driver's side door handle. As the vehicle attempts to drive off, one of the agents at the front of the car points their gun at the driver and several shots are heard. The car then continues to drive away from the officer and crashes into the side of the street. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has claimed the ICE agent shot Good multiple times because she was trying to run over the officer in her car. But Democratic Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey called that version of events a false narrative, saying it was clear to him she was trying to leave the scene, not attack an agent. He said the Trump administration will use chaos as an opportunity to "occupy" the city and the New York Times reports that 100 more federal agents are being deployed. Governor Walz has activated the state's National Guard to help with security of the protests. At the scene of the crash on Thursday, blood from the shooting could still be seen in the snow. People set up a vigil at the site to honour Good, lining the bank with candles and roses. Hundreds of demonstrators showed up throughout the day, shouting insults at ICE and offering their neighbours coffee on the cold winter day. Susie Hawyard, a minister, said she went to the scene of the shooting as soon as she heard the news to verify "with my own eyes" what happened. "I was horrified," she said. "I saw the car, I saw Renee's car, I saw Renee's blood." Protesters also gathered at a federal building in Minneapolis early on Thursday morning, where they were met with armed officers. The protests remained largely peaceful there, as residents expressed their anger over the killing of Good. "They cannot get away with killing someone. There has to be consequences for actions," said Gavin, one of dozens of people outside the federal building. Those who knew Good said she was a poet and guitarist who had just moved to the city of Minneapolis. Her mother, Donna Ganger, told the Minnesota Star Tribune that her daughter was "probably terrified" during the confrontation with officers that saw her fatally shot. "She was extremely compassionate," Ganger told the daily newspaper. "She's taken care of people all her life. She was loving, forgiving and affectionate. She was an amazing human being." Even those who did not know Good said they were touched by her death. "Renee was everything that was good about our community," said Nimco Ahmad, a Somali immigrant who grew up just blocks from the incident. Ahmad said she and others were gathered to help ensure justice would be secured for Good. The exclusion of state authorities from the probe into Good's killing is likely to undermine public trust, said Edward Maguire, a criminology professor at Arizona State University. "From a criminological perspective, jurisdictional claims in cases like this are often less about legal requirements and more about political efforts to control the investigation and shape its outcome," he said. But the state could still file criminal charges later against the federal officer who killed Good, said Bryna Godar, a staff attorney with the State Democracy Research Initiative at the University of Wisconsin Law School.

**Excerpt**

The continued mysteries surrounding the intelligence operation to seize Maduro A week on from the dramatic raid that seized Venezuela's Nicolás Maduro, details of the intelligence surrounding the operation are becoming clearer, but some mysteries still remain. The intelligence The mission took months of planning and intelligence gathering. In August the CIA is believed to have sent a team of undercover officers into Venezuela. The US does not have a functioning embassy in the country, so the team could not use diplomatic cover and were working in what is known in the intelligence worlds as a "denied area". They were on the ground to scout targets and recruit people who could help. US officials have said they had one particular source who was able to provide detailed intelligence on Maduro's whereabouts which would have been critical to the operation. Identities of such sources are normally highly protected but it quickly emerged it was a "government" source who must have been particularly close to Maduro and in his inner circle in order to know where he was going to be, and when. That has led to intense speculation about who it was and what has happened to them. But their identity is still not public. All of the human intelligence on the ground fed into a "mosaic" of intelligence to plan the operation in conjunction with technical intelligence like mapping and satellite imagery. The mission The scale, speed and success of the operation were unprecedented. "This thing worked like clockwork. That doesn't happen often," explains David Fitzgerald, a former Latin America Chief of Operations for the CIA who also worked on planning missions with the US military. "It is not the military tactics that drive the operation, but the intelligence." Around 150 aircraft were involved in the mission, with helicopters flying only a hundred or so feet above the terrain to get to Maduro's compound. There are still some mysteries though. One is exactly how the US turned off the lights in Caracas in order to enable the special forces to arrive. "The lights of Caracas were largely turned off due to a certain expertise that we have - it was dark and it was deadly," US President Donald Trump said. The fact that the US Cyber Command was publicly thanked for its role in the operation has led to speculation that US military hackers got inside Venezuelan networks in advance to shut the grid down at the right moment - but details are limited. The failure of Chinese and Russian air defences has also led to speculation of what kind of jamming or electronic warfare technology was deployed by the US in the air to aid the operation. The US Space Command, which operates satellites, also received credit for creating a "pathway" for the special forces to enter unseen. Stealth drones were also thought to have been deployed. Exact details of the capabilities used are likely to remain secret, but America's adversaries will be doing their best to try and understand what happened. The battle Those who have planned complex operations say it is remarkable that everything went according to plan, something that does not usually happen. One helicopter was hit but was still able to fly and no US forces were killed. There are still few details about the battle that took place at Maduro's compound, Fuerte Tiuna. The Cuban government said that 32 of its nationals were killed by US forces. These were bodyguards provided to defend Maduro by its ally, Cuba. The Caribbean country provides not just bodyguards, but wider security support to the regime. "Within the immediate perimeter of Maduro, there were probably zero Venezuelan security officers and on the outer perimeter maybe a mixture of both," says Fitzgerald. The fact that they proved so ineffective has also led to questions about whether some elements of the regime facilitated the mission in some way. US forces were also able to get to Maduro as he was trying to lock himself into a steel safe room but before he could close the door. They had blowtorches and explosives ready to blow the door open if needed, but the speed of the apprehension again suggests an incredibly detailed understanding of the layout of the compound. The plan The CIA undertook a classified assessment in advance of the operation, looking at what might happen if Maduro was removed. The analysts examined a series of options and, according to reports, came to the view that working with elements of the existing regime offered more chance for stability than trying to install the opposition in exile in power. That helped solidify the view that the US should work with Delcy Rodríguez the vice-president. There are thought to have been back-channel, secret contacts with elements of the Maduro regime in advance of the operation to discuss how people might position themselves given different potential outcomes. The exact detail of those remain mysterious but they likely do much to explain why the mission took place, why it was successful and also what the plan is next.

**Excerpt**

'I feel free': Australia's social media ban, one month on For the first time in years, Amy feels free. One month since Australia's teen social media ban kicked in, she says she is "disconnected from my phone" and her daily routine has changed. The 14-year-old first felt the pangs of online addiction in the days after the ban started. "I knew that I was still unable to access Snapchat - however, from instinct, I still reached to open the app in the morning," she wrote on day two of the ban in a diary she kept for the first week afterwards. By day four of the ban – when ten platforms including Facebook, Instagram and TikTok went dark for thousands of Australian children aged 16 and under – she had started to question the magnetic pull of Snapchat. "While it's sad that I can't snap my friends, I can still text them on other platforms and I honestly feel kind of free knowing that I don't have to worry about doing my streaks anymore," Amy wrote. Streaks - a Snapchat feature considered by some as highly addictive – require two people to send a "snap" – a photo or video – to each other every day in order to maintain their "streak" which can last for days, months, even years. By day six, the allure of Snapchat - which she first downloaded when she was 12 and checked several times a day - was fading fast for Amy. "I often used to call my friends on Snapchat after school, but because I am no longer able to, I went for a run," she wrote. Fast forward a month, and her habits are markedly different. "Previously, it was part of my routine to open Snapchat," the Sydney teen tells the BBC. "Opening Snapchat would often lead to Instagram and then TikTok, which sometimes resulted in me losing track of time after being swept up by the algorithm ... I now reach for my phone less and mainly use it when I genuinely need to do something." 'It hasn't really changed anything' Amy's experience is likely to put a smile on the face of Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who in the lead-up to the ban pleaded with kids to kick their social media habits. The government has cited online bullying and protecting young people from online predators and harmful content as some of the reasons for the ban. Since 10 December, tech companies risk being fined up to A$49.5m (US$32m, £25m) if they don't take "reasonable steps" to boot under-16s off their platforms. But Albanese's hopes that the ban would usher in a new generation of sports-loving, book-reading, instrument-playing kids may have fallen flat for many. Aahil, 13, hasn't read more books, played more sports or started learning an instrument. Instead, he spends about two and a half hours on various social media platforms every day – the same as before the ban started. He still has his YouTube and Snapchat accounts – both use fake birthdays - and spends most of his time on gaming platform Roblox and Discord, a messaging platform popular with gamers – neither of which are banned. "It hasn't really changed anything," Aahil says, as most of his friends still have active social media accounts. But his mum Mau has noticed a change. "He's moodier," she says, adding he spends more time playing video games than before. "When he was on social media, he was more social … more talkative with us," Mau says, though, she adds, his moodiness may also simply be the "teenage years". Consumer psychologist Christina Anthony says moods might be due to the ban's short-term effects on emotion regulation. "For many teenagers, social media isn't just entertainment - it's a tool for managing boredom, stress, and social anxiety, and for seeking reassurance or connection," she says. "When access is disrupted, some young people may initially experience irritability, restlessness, or a sense of social disconnection… not because the platform itself is essential, but because a familiar coping mechanism has been removed." Over time, young people may adopt new coping strategies such as talking to trusted adults, she adds. Snapchat's out, WhatsApp's in In another Sydney household, the ban has had little impact. "My usage of social media is the same as prior to the ban because I made new accounts for both TikTok and Instagram with ages above 16 years old," says 15-year-old Lulu. The new law has influenced her in other ways. "I am reading a bit more because I don't want to be on social media as much." But she's not spending more times outdoors, nor is she arranging to meet friends face-to-face. Instead, Lulu, along with Amy and Aahil, all started using WhatsApp and Facebook's Messenger more – neither are banned - because they couldn't contact friends who had lost access to their social media accounts. This, Anthony says, goes to the heart of why social media is fun and engaging in the first place: it's social. "The enjoyment doesn't come from scrolling alone, but from shared attention," she says, "knowing that friends are seeing the same posts, reacting to them, and participating in the same conversations." When that "emotional lift" fades, the platform begins to feel "oddly unsocial". "That's why some young people disengage even if they technically still have access…without peers present, both the social feedback and the mood payoff drop sharply." Kids flock to apps as FOMO sets in Seeking lookalike apps to fill the void was exactly what thousands of Australians did in the days before the ban started, with three little-known apps - Lemon8, Yope and Coverstar - surging in downloads. This attraction to alternative photo and video-sharing platforms fits into what's known as compensatory behaviour, Anthony says. "When a familiar and emotionally rewarding activity is restricted, people don't simply stop seeking that reward… they look for alternative ways to get it," she says. "For teens, that often means compensating with platforms or activities that provide similar psychological benefits: social connection, identity expression, entertainment, or escapism." That initial rise has now dropped but daily downloads are still higher than usual, says Adam Blacker from Apptopia, a US-based company which tracks consumer trends of mobile apps. The fall in downloads suggested "a chunk of kids might be embracing the new rules and swapping their time spent on mobile for time spent elsewhere," Blacker says. Amy was one of the thousands who downloaded Lemon8 - created by the makers behind TikTok - before the ban. "This was largely influenced by social pressure and a fear of missing out as many people around me were doing the same," she says. But she has never used it. "Since then, my interest in social media has decreased significantly, and I don't feel any need to download or use alternative platforms." The number of Australians downloading virtual private networks – or VPNs – also increased before the ban, but has since fallen back to normal levels. VPN technology allows users to hide their location and pretend they are based in another country, in effect, bypassing local laws. But they have limited appeal to teens, Blacker says, because many social media platforms can detect VPNs. "Teens can only leverage VPNs to create a new account," he says, so "they would be starting over in terms of connections, settings, photos and more". Gaming 'much harder to get into' In the months before the ban, debate swirled around the exclusion of gaming platforms, with critics concerned that many youngsters use them in the same way as social media, meaning they presented the same types of potential harms. While there's no evidence yet on whether more teenagers have switched to the likes of Roblox, Discord and Minecraft to socialise, it's a real possibility, says Mark Johnson, an expert in gaming live stream platforms such as Twitch, which is part of the ban. "But that's also contingent on a young person having the required hardware, the required cultural and technical knowledge, and so forth - games are much harder to get into, for the uninitiated, than social media sites," he says. Johnson, who lectures in digital cultures at the University of Sydney, says the reaction to the ban has been mixed. "A lot of parents seem to be reassured and pleased that their children and teenagers are spending far less time in social media," he says. "Equally, some are lamenting the newfound difficulty their young people are having in communicating with their friends, and in some cases with family members who live elsewhere." A spokesperson for the eSafety Commissioner says they will release their findings on how the ban is going - including the number of accounts that have been deactivated since 10 December - in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the Communications Minister Anika Wells says the ban is "making a real difference" and leaders across the globe are looking to mirror the Australian model. "Delaying access to social media is giving young Australians three more years to build their community and identity offline, starting with spending more time with family and friends over the summer holidays," the spokesperson says. Time will tell For Amy, one of the unforeseen benefits came in the hours after the Bondi Beach shootings on 14 December when two gunmen killed 15 people and injured dozens at an event marking the Jewish celebration Hanukkah. "After the Bondi Beach incident, I was glad that I had not spent too long on TikTok, as I would have likely been exposed to an overwhelming amount of negative information and potentially disturbing content," she wrote on 15 December. She says her time spent on social media has halved since the ban and while TikTok and Instagram are still fun, not having Snapchat has been a gamechanger. "Snapchat gives me the most notifications so that's usually what gets me on my phone and then everything happens after that," she says. For Amy's mum Yuko, she's noticed her daughter seems content spending more time by herself. "We're not entirely sure whether this shift is directly because of the ban or simply part of having a quieter holiday period," she says, with most Australian students on school holidays until the end of January. "It's hard to say yet whether [the ban] will be a positive or negative change - only time will tell."

### 15. [Trump's warning looms over Iran protests response](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c23r4yeyxl9o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

Trump's warning looms over Iran protests response Tehran has witnessed its largest anti-government demonstrations in decades, as protests swept through dozens of districts across the capital and its wider metropolitan area of nearly 16 million people. For several hours there on Thursday night, security forces appeared unusually restrained. In areas where crowds were especially large, police and security units largely avoided direct confrontation, raising questions about whether the authorities were deliberately holding back. That restraint, however, appears selective and strategic rather than absolute. While Tehran has seen a comparatively cautious approach, reports from smaller cities and provinces around the country tell a far more violent story. According to multiple Iranian human rights organisations, including the Germany-based Kurdish Iranian human rights group Hengaw and US-based Human Rights Activist News Agency (Hrana), more than 40 people have been killed since the protests began nearly two weeks ago. BBC Persian's verification team has confirmed the identities of at least 21 victims through interviews with relatives, many of whom were killed in Lorestan and Kurdish-majority regions of Illam and Kermanshah provinces. Video evidence obtained by the BBC shows security forces firing directly at protesters. At least four security forces have also been killed. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei has issued a firm warning, declaring that the Islamic Republic "will not back down in the face of vandals". In a speech on Friday addressing the unrest, he framed the protests as foreign-inspired sabotage. Referring to property damage in Tehran, he said demonstrators had destroyed their own buildings "just to please the president of the United States". Following the seizure by the US of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, many within Iran's leadership are increasingly concerned that the United States may be serious about its threats, particularly after a 12-day war with Israel last June, during which the US bombed Iran's nuclear sites, and the weakening of Iranian-backed militant groups across the region. It is possible these developments could embolden Washington to strike Iran without fear of significant retaliation. President Donald Trump has loomed large over the regime's calculations. Since almost the start of the protests, Trump has issued repeated warnings to Tehran, stating that the US would respond forcefully if peaceful protesters were killed. In a recent US radio interview, Trump said Iran would "get hit very hard" if it repeated the mass killings seen during previous uprisings. He downplayed responsibility for deaths so far by attributing some to "stampedes", but stressed that Iranian authorities had been "told very strongly" where the red lines lay. It is not clear whether these warnings may be behind the regime's response. In Tehran, where symbolically the costs are greatest, security forces appear to be exercising restraint to avoid images of mass bloodshed. Gunshots were reportedly heard late Thursday night in Tehran, but due to the near blackout of the internet it is difficult to verify exactly what is happening in the city. Outside the capital, however, repression has been swift and lethal. During the mass protests in Iran in 2022 following the death of the Kurdish woman Mahsa Amini in police custody in Tehran, more than 500 people were killed, human rights groups say. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), along with its affiliated militias and anti-riot police, played a pivotal role in violently suppressing those protests. Historically, the Islamic Republic has relied on a layered security apparatus to suppress mass protests. Alongside riot police, the regime deploys the Basij militia - a volunteer paramilitary force under IRGC control - often operating in plain clothes. In more intense situations, command shifts from police to IRGC commanders, signalling that unrest is being treated as a national security threat rather than a civil disturbance. This escalation typically precedes harsher crackdowns, including mass arrests and lethal force. Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian has called for tolerance of what he described as "legitimate protests," but his authority is limited. Ultimate control over security policy rests with the supreme leader, not the presidency. The current approach suggests the regime is buying time, attempting to exhaust protesters, limit casualties in visible areas, and avoid crossing thresholds that could provoke direct foreign retaliation.

The musician and the strongman leader - what you need to know about Uganda's election As Ugandans go to the polls next week they are faced with a choice of propelling a leader into his fifth decade in power or backing a candidate seeking to capitalise on the desire for change from some quarters. President Yoweri Museveni, 81, in office since 1986, is aiming for a seventh successive election victory. His main challenger, pop-star-turned-politician Bobi Wine, 43, has promised a revolution in governance and sweeping reforms. Campaigning has been marked by the disruption of opposition activities, including the detention of activists and the breaking-up of rallies by police. With high rates of youth unemployment in a country where the majority of the population is under 30, the economy has become a key concern in the campaign. When is Uganda's general election? Polling is scheduled for Thursday 15 January. Polls are due to open at 07:00 local time (04:00 GMT) and close at 16:00. Anyone in the queue at that time will be allowed to vote. What are Ugandans voting for? The 21.6 million registered voters will be taking part in three elections: Presidential - there are eight candidates to choose from - Parliamentary (1) - 353 constituency MPs will be elected - Parliamentary (2) - 146 women representatives - one per local district - will be elected - Who could be the next president? Museveni and Bobi Wine are the two front-runners among the all-male list of eight hopefuls. This is the second time they are facing off at the ballot box, with the president winning the 2021 poll, marred by allegations of rigging and a crackdown on the opposition, with 58% of the vote compared to Bobi Wine's 35%. Yoweri Museveni - National Resistance Movement (NRM) Museveni first took power by force 40 years ago as the leader of a guerrilla army that pledged to restore democracy after years of civil war and the dictatorship of Idi Amin. Once feted as being part of a fresh generation of African leaders set to usher in a new democratic era, growing accusations of human rights abuses and harassment of opposition figures have soured that perception. Critics say he has ruled with an iron hand since he seized control and having gone back on pledges to step down, he is the only president most Ugandans have known. Currently the third longest-serving leader in Africa, Museveni has benefitted from two constitutional amendments - removing age and term limits - that have allowed him to keep running for office. He argues that he remains the country's sole guarantor of stability and progress. Bobi Wine - National Unity Platform (NUP) The one-time hit maker Bobi Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, is widely thought to be the strongest of the seven opposition candidates. Dubbed at one point the "ghetto president", he is seen as embodying youthful aspirations for change and he enjoys strong support among young, urban, working-class voters. Bobi Wine established himself as a serious contender five years ago, coming second and helping to restrict Museveni to the lowest share of the vote in any election he has contested. Bobi Wine's NUP party became the largest opposition force in parliament. Since that vote, Bobi Wine has continued to face harassment from the security forces. The other candidates are Frank Bulira, Robert Kasibante, Joseph Mabirizi, Nandala Mafabi, Mugisha Muntu and Mubarak Munyagwa. Prominent opposition figure Kizza Besigye, who has run against Museveni four times, is not able to take part and remains in jail on treason charges after being arrested in neighbouring Kenya in 2024. He has denied any wrongdoing. What are the key concerns for voters? Economic issues, particularly unemployment, are weighing on the minds of many as they get ready to vote. The average income per person has been slowly but steadily rising since the pandemic but there do not seem to be enough jobs to match the bulging numbers of young people looking for work. There are also concerns about poor infrastructure and disparities in access to quality education and healthcare. The country has however managed to avoid the spike in the cost of living that has affected so many other countries in the region and led to pressure on those in power. Corruption is another major concern. Uganda comes 140th out of 180 countries on Transparency International's annual Corruption Perceptions Index, with widespread bribery and nepotism reported in government institutions. Will the vote be free and fair? The conduct of elections in Uganda has often been criticised. This time round officials say the vote will be free and fair but UN experts have warned that may not be the case, citing what they describe as a "pervasive climate of fear" in Uganda. During the campaign period, opposition supporters have faced escalating harassment, including arrest on politically motivated charges, rights groups say. Bobi Wine's rallies, unlike those of Museveni, have been disrupted by security forces. Amnesty International described the use of tear gas, pepper spray, beatings, and other violent acts as "a brutal campaign of repression" ahead of the vote. The government says the measures are necessary to ensure a peaceful election and prevent anyone from inciting riots on polling day. When it comes to the election itself, Bobi Wine has urged voters to stay at polling stations and safeguard their ballots to help prevent vote rigging. But election officials have said people should cast their ballots peacefully and then leave, assuring that the vote counting will be transparent and observed by party agents, the media and election monitors. Critics, however, have questioned the independence of the electoral commission. Despite government denials, there are also fears, based on previous experience, of an internet shutdown during the election aimed at preventing people from verifying results. The NUP says it has a vote-monitoring app that can overcome this issue by using Bluetooth technology. When will we know the results? If everything goes to plan the outcome of the presidential vote should be known by 16:00 local time (13:00 GMT) on Saturday 17 January. This is because by law the electoral commission must declare the presidential result within 48 hours from the end of voting. Polls are due to close at 16:00 local time on Thursday. How does the presidential vote work? The counting of votes should begin at each polling station as soon as voting closes with the results eventually being transmitted to a central tallying centre. A candidate must gain more than 50% of the votes cast nationwide to win the presidency in the first round, otherwise there will be a run-off within 30 days between the top two candidates. Museveni has always gained more than 50% in the initial round of voting. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.
