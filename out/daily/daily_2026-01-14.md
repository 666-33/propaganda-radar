Starlink reportedly made free in Iran - but protesters are taking huge risks by using it Starlink has reportedly waived monthly subscription payments for users inside Iran after its government shut down the internet last Thursday - cutting off millions of people from their families, livelihoods and access to information, during a deadly crackdown on protests. The satellite technology has become a vital communications lifeline for some of those in the country trying to tell the outside world what has been happening on the ground in recent days. Two people in Iran told BBC Persian their device was running on Tuesday night even though they had not been keeping up with subscription payments. The director of an organisation that helps Iranians get online also told BBC Persian that Starlink had been made free. The satellite technology, which belongs to Elon Musk's SpaceX company, provides internet to tens of thousands of people in Iran, despite the fact it is illegal there. Since the internet was shut down, it has become one of the last, if not the last, remaining channels for Iranians to communicate with the outside world. The BBC has approached SpaceX to confirm it has waived the fee, but they are yet to respond. Using the service in Iran carries a punishment of up to two years in prison and authorities have reportedly been searching for Starlink dishes to stop people from connecting to the internet. "They're going onto rooftops and checking the surrounding buildings," says Parsa - not his real name - who spoke to BBC Persian using a Starlink connection. "What people need to know is that the government is searching areas where a lot of footage has come out, so they need to be even more cautious," he says. The device operates like a mobile phone mast in space, using a constellation of satellites to communicate with small dishes on the ground with a built-in WiFi router. But the device is costly and beyond the means of many in Iran - so making it free may lead to its wider use. Speaking to Al Jazeera TV on Monday, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said the internet had been cut off "after we confronted terrorist operations and realised orders were coming from outside the country". Iran's Fars news agency, which is affiliated with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), claimed internet restrictions were imposed to stop foreign social media platforms such as WhatsApp and Instagram being used "to organise violence and unrest." Human rights groups have condemned the blanket blackout as an abuse of power and a spokesperson for the UN's Human rights office told the BBC the shutdown "impacts the works of those documenting human rights violations." So far, one human rights group has confirmed the killing of more than 2,400 protesters during the unrest, as well as almost 150 people affiliated with security forces, although these numbers are believed to be much higher. It is difficult to gauge the true scale of bloodshed because, like other international news organisations, the BBC is not able to report from inside the country. The internet shutdown has also made it hard to gather and verify evidence of what is happening on the ground. "I think a lot of people are connected, but only a very small number are taking the risk of sending information out," explains Parsa. According to human rights organisation Witness, at least 50,000 people are using Starlink to access the internet. Mahsa Alimardani, who works as its associate director for technology, threats and opportunities, says the Iranian authorities have tried "aggressively jamming" Starlink to stop people accessing the internet but it has not been successful. "That's why they are resorting to physical confiscations," she adds. But those who are taking the risk are going to great lengths. One man who spoke to BBC Persian said he travelled almost 1,000km (620 miles) to a border area so he could use mobile networks of neighbouring countries to send video he recorded. The scene he witnessed - of a huge number of bodies lying on the ground at a forensic medical centre in Tehran - was so distressing that he felt compelled to share it, he told the BBC. The Iranian government has a long track record of spying on its citizens, including digitally, to tighten its grip on society. Phishing techniques have reportedly been used to hack phones and access people's data and Iran's access to the internet is largely restricted to a domestic service that mimics a private intranet. Access to Western social media platforms such as Instagram, WhatsApp and Telegram is blocked, meaning Iranians have to use virtual private networks (VPNs) in order to access them. But despite this, Instagram is one of the most popular platforms in Iran, with an estimated 50 million users. Though some news is being shared online, experts say the Iranian government aims to control the narrative by limiting what information gets out. Ana Diamond, research associate at the Oxford Disinformation and Extremism Lab, says the government is weaponising information by carefully curating it. "Such material is designed less to inform than to condition; to almost normalise casualties, especially as the Iranian government calls them rioters, eroding collective resistance, and preparing the public - both inside and outside of Iran - for escalations of violence that may be yet to come if the protests continue," Diamond says. Despite the dangers, Starlink has become indispensable for many Iranians communicating what is happening inside the country to the rest of the world. "I'd rather not think about it [getting caught]. It can be very frightening," Parsa says. On Tuesday, Iranian intelligence forces said they had seized a large consignment of Starlink kits allegedly intended for "espionage and sabotage operations" inside the country. However, BBC Persian has confirmed through multiple sources in Iran that the kits are used by many people wanting to communicate without censorship. Parsa cautions that getting caught using the device is not the only danger. If Iranians want to send videos that are shared or intercepted online, he says, "they need to understand that if they record them from home or from the place where the device is kept, their risk increases, and the government can identify the location".

**Excerpt**

Uganda election chief says he has had threats over results declaration The head of Uganda's electoral body says he has received threats warning him against declaring certain presidential candidates the winners of Thursday's election. Simon Byabakama said he would not be intimidated by such threats from senior state officials, whom he did not name. He was responding to a BBC question about a widely shared video which shows a presidential assistant saying the electoral commission would never declare opposition candidate Robert Kyagulanyi, popularly known as Bobi Wine, as president, even if he were to win. "Some people say if you don't declare so-and-so as president, you will see. I tell them that I am not in the business of donating votes," said Byabakama. President Yoweri Museveni, 81, who has ruled the country for nearly four decades, is seeking a seventh term in office. Bobi Wine, a 43-year-old pop star turned politician, is Museveni's main challenger, seeking to unseat him for the second time after finishing runner-up in 2021 polls. Six other candidates are also in the race, in which about 21.6 million voters are registered to vote. Campaigning has been marked by the disruption of opposition activities, including the detention of activists and the breaking-up of rallies by police. At the Electoral Commission headquarters in the capital, Kampala, Byabakama said he was not worried about threats from what he called "idle people". "You can see from my demeanour that fear is a word that does not exist in my vocabulary," said the poll chief, adding that only the will of voters and the law would guide the process. In the video shared by the Daily Monitor newspaper on social media last week, Yiga Kisakyamukama, the special presidential assistant for service delivery and monitoring, was captured saying Museveni would never leave power through the ballot. "Don't expect, don't even think, that Simon Byabakama would announce Bobi Wine. President Museveni, who is on the chair, will remain on the chair. Never think that Museveni would leave power through voting. No, no, no - don't waste our time," Kisakyamukama was heard saying. But Byabakama said Uganda's law, not individual opinions or threats, would determine the outcome of the presidential election. "The law says that the candidate who receives more than 50% plus one of the total valid votes cast is the president of Uganda. It is the voters who determine how many votes a candidate gets. What the voters have said is what I will declare to the nation," he added. The poll chief said he would declare the results within 48 hours of the close of polling, in accordance with the country's laws. Responding to concerns about the heavy military presence in the streets, Byabakama said security forces were deployed to maintain peace and stability during the electoral process and should not intimidate voters. He also acknowledged opposition concerns about some polling stations being located within military premises, saying the commission was investigating the reports. "If we find that it is true, we shall take the necessary measures to address it," he added. On Tuesday, the authorities cut internet access and limited mobile services across the country in order to curb "misinformation, disinformation, electoral fraud and related risks". The network outage has heightened concerns about repression in the run-up to the vote, and has been described by the UN human rights office as "deeply worrying".

### 3. [US and UK pulling some personnel from Qatar military base](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c701xywwxw8o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

US and UK pulling some personnel from Qatar military base The US and UK are reducing the number of personnel at the Al-Udeid air base in Qatar, as US President Donald Trump considers whether to take action against Iran over its crackdown on anti-government protests. Officials have told CBS, the BBC's US partner, that the partial American withdrawal was a "precautionary measure". The BBC understands some UK military personnel are also being removed. A Qatari government statement said the measures reportedly being taken by the US were "in response to the current regional tensions". The Foreign Office has also temporarily closed the British embassy in Tehran, which will now operate remotely, a government spokesperson said. According to rights groups, more than 2,400 anti-government demonstrators have been killed in the recent violent crackdown by the Iranian authorities. Regarding the removal of military personnel, the Qatari government said it would continue to "implement all necessary measures to safeguard the security and safety of its citizens and residents as a top priority, including actions related to the protection of critical infrastructure and military facilities". A UK Ministry of Defence spokesperson declined to comment on reports that UK personnel were being withdrawn "due to operational security". Al-Udeid is the largest US military base in the Middle East and about 10,000 personnel are based there, as well as about 100 UK staff. It is not clear how many will be leaving. Earlier this week, Trump warned the US would take "very strong action" against Iran if the authorities execute protesters. Iran has said it will retaliate if attacked by the US. On Wednesday, he said his administration had been told "on good authority" that "the killing in Iran is stopping, and there's no plan for executions". When questioned by a reporter, Trump said that these were "very important sources on the other side" and that he hoped the reports were true. The US president was also asked whether military action was now off the table, to which he replied: "We're going to watch and see what the process is." The Reuters news agency, citing diplomats, reported that while some personnel had been told to leave the Al-Udeid air base, there was no immediate sign of large numbers of troops being bussed out like in the hours before an Iranian strike last year. Speaking to Fox News on Wednesday, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi warned Donald Trump to "not repeat the same mistake that you did in June," adding: "You know, if you try a failed experience, you will get the same result." As well as the temporary closure of the British embassy in Tehran, the US Mission to Saudi Arabia has advised its personnel and citizens to "exercise increased caution and limit non-essential travel to any military installations in the region". Italy and Poland have published statements urging their citizens to leave Iran, while Germany has issued a notice to air operators recommending that flights do not enter Tehran, citing potential risk from "escalating conflict and anti-aviation weaponry". Iran's government has accused the US of seeking to "manufacture a pretext for military intervention", with the parliament speaker warning that if the US attacked, both Israeli and US military and shipping centres in the region would become legitimate targets. The latest protests in Iran began at the end of December following the collapse of the currency and as the country deals with soaring living costs. They quickly widened into demands for political change and became one of the most serious challenges to the clerical establishment since the 1979 Islamic revolution. The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) said it had so far confirmed the killing of 2,403 protesters, as well as 12 children, despite an internet blackout. More than 18,434 protesters have been arrested during the unrest, the group also reported. Amnesty International said there were "mass unlawful killings committed on an unprecedented scale", citing "verified videos and credible information from eyewitnesses in Iran". The organisation urged UN member states to recognise the "crimes committed by security forces" in the protests.

### 4. [Denmark warns of 'fundamental disagreement' after White House talks on Greenland](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx20vzz0g8vo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

Denmark warns of 'fundamental disagreement' after White House talks on Greenland Denmark's foreign minister has said there is a "fundamental disagreement" with the US over Greenland after talks at the White House. Lars Lokke Rasmussen said the meeting with Vice-President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Wednesday had been "frank but constructive". But he added that US President Trump was insisting on "conquering" Greenland which was "totally unacceptable". "We made it very, very clear that this is not in the interest of [Denmark]," he said. Trump afterwards reiterated his interest in acquiring the resource-rich island, a position that has rattled allies across Europe and stoked tensions with Nato. The hour-long meeting between the US, Denmark and Greenland failed to bring a major breakthrough, although all sides agreed to set-up a high-level working group to discuss the future of the autonomous Danish territory. Rasmussen said there were "red lines" the US could not cross, and the working group would meet in the coming weeks in an effort to find a compromise. He added that Denmark and Greenland were open to the possibility of the US opening more military bases on the island. "It's productive to start discussions at a high level," he said. Rasmussen also said there was an "element of truth" in Trump's view that security should be bolstered to counter Russian and Chinese interests in the Arctic. But he said the president's comments about the presence of Russian and Chinese warships around Greenland were "not true". Despite being a sparsely populated territory, Greenland's location between North America and the Arctic makes it well placed for early warning systems in the event of missile attacks and for monitoring vessels in the region. Trump has repeatedly said acquiring it is vital to US national security. The US already has more than 100 military personnel permanently stationed at its Pituffik base in Greenland's north-western tip, a facility that has been operated by the US since World War Two. Under existing agreements with Denmark, the US has the power to bring as many troops as it wants to Greenland. After the talks on Wednesday, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Greenland Vivian Motzfeldt said the territory was open to greater co-operation with the US but also opposed a takeover. "We have shown where our limits are," Motzfeldt said. Vance and Rubio did not immediately comment after the meeting. Trump, meanwhile, told reporters in the Oval Office: "We need Greenland for national security." "The problem is there's not a thing that Denmark can do about it if Russia or China wants to occupy Greenland, but there's everything we can do," he said, adding that he does not believe the US can rely on Denmark to defend the island. The talks came as allies in Europe moved quickly to show support for Greenland. Sweden on Wednesday pledged to send armed forces to the territory at Denmark's request. France's foreign minister said the country planned to open a consulate on the island next month. Germany said in a statement provided to the BBC that it would send a "reconnaissance team" to Greenland to "explore the general conditions for possible military contributions to support Denmark in ensuring security in the region". Denmark said its military expansion in Greenland will take place "in close co-operation with allies". "Geopolitical tensions have spread to the arctic," it said in a statement. The White House talks were just the latest round of diplomatic discussions over Trump's growing interest in the territory. It is unclear whether the president is considering using military force to seize the island, and he once again declined to rule it out when asked on Wednesday. Other options reportedly under consideration include purchasing the territory - though neither Danes nor Greenlanders have said it is for sale. Since taking office, Vance has criticised Denmark's stewardship of Greenland. The vice president visited soon after taking office. Trump has argued control of the territory is critical for his planned missile defence system, Golden Dome. "It is vital for the Golden Dome that we are building," Trump said in a social media post early on Wednesday. "NATO should be leading the way for us to get it." Public opinion polls suggest a majority of Greenland residents oppose coming under US control. Most Americans oppose US control of Greenland as well. A Reuters/Ipsos poll released Wednesday indicated that just 17% of Americans support the US seizing Greenland, compared to 47 percent who said they opposed Trump's push to acquire the island. The latest talks on Greenland follow US military operations in Venezuela and against ISIS targets in Syria. Trump has also threatened to take military action to stop Iran's crackdown on a growing protest movement engulfing the nation.

Trump administration pauses immigrant visa processing for 75 countries The Trump administration is placing an indefinite pause on immigrant visa processing from 75 countries, further restricting the legal routes for entering the US. The State Department on Wednesday said the administration wants to bring "an end to the abuse" of the system "by those who would extract wealth from the American people" by using welfare and public benefits. President Donald Trump has sought to limit both illegal and legal crossing into the US since returning to office, and his administration has already halted immigrant visa processing for people from Brazil, Iran, Russia and Somalia. The order takes effect on 21 January, but a full list of the 75 countries has not yet been released. "The State Department will use its long-standing authority to deem ineligible potential immigrants who would become a public charge on the United States and exploit the generosity of the American people," said Tommy Pigott, Principal Deputy spokesperson for the US State Department. The department, led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, will pause the visa processing while it reassesses its procedures "to prevent the entry of foreign nationals who would take welfare and public benefits", Piggott added. According to the Associated Press, the State Department has instructed consular officers to halt immigrant visa applications from the affected countries. But the suspension will not apply to non-immigrant, temporary tourist, or business visas. In recent months, the State Department has increased restrictions on migration from countries Trump has deemed a threat to national security, including Russia, Iran and Afghanistan and several countries in Africa. After an immigrant from Afghanistan was charged in the November in the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, DC, the administration banned or limited the entry of nationals of 19 countries. In December, it expanded the travel ban to people from five additional countries and those travelling on Palestinian Authority-issued documents. Asylum cases, citizenship processing and green card applications for immigrants from the initial 19 countries in the ban have also been paused.

**Excerpt**

US launches phase two of Gaza peace plan with new technocratic government US envoy Steve Witkoff has announced the start of phase two of President Donald Trump's plan to end the war in Gaza, with a technocratic Palestinian government established in the territory. Under phase one, Hamas and Israel agreed a ceasefire in October, as well as a hostage-prisoner exchange, a partial Israeli withdrawal, and an aid surge. Witkoff said phase two would also see the reconstruction and full demilitarisation of Gaza, including the disarmament of Hamas and other Palestinian groups. "The US expects Hamas to comply fully with its obligations," he warned, noting these include the return of the body of the last dead Israeli hostage. "Failure to do so will bring serious consequences." However, two key points of phase two could be problematic. Hamas has previously refused to give up its weapons without the creation of an independent Palestinian state, and Israel has not committed to fully withdrawing from Gaza. The ceasefire is also fragile at best, with both sides accusing each other of repeated violations. Almost 450 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli strikes since it came into force, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. And humanitarian conditions in the territory remain dire, according to the UN, which has stressed the need for the unrestricted flow of critical supplies. In his statement, Witkoff declared that with the launch of phase two of Trump's 20-point peace plan on Wednesday, Gaza was "moving from ceasefire to demilitarisation, technocratic governance, and reconstruction". "Phase Two establishes a transitional technocratic Palestinian administration in Gaza, the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG), and begins the full demilitarization and reconstruction of Gaza, primarily the disarmament of all unauthorized personnel," he said. Following the announcement, regional mediators Egypt, Qatar and Turkey welcomed the formation of what they called the "Palestinian Technocratic Committee to Administer the Gaza Strip", saying it would contribute to "efforts aimed at consolidating stability and improving the humanitarian situation". They also revealed that the 15-member committee would be headed by Ali Shaath, a former deputy planning minister in the Palestinian Authority (PA), which governs parts of the occupied West Bank not under Israeli control. Gaza's transitional administration will operate under the supervision of a "Board of Peace", which will be chaired by Trump, according to the 20-point plan he unveiled three months ago. Announcements related to the board are expected in the coming days, including when the president visits the World Economic Forum in Davos next week. Nickolay Mladenov, a Bulgarian politician and former UN Middle East envoy, is set to be the board's representative on the ground in Gaza. Trump's plan says an International Stabilisation Force (ISF) will also be deployed to Gaza to train and support vetted Palestinian police forces. Earlier on Wednesday, Hamas and its ally Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) said in a joint statement that they had agreed to support the efforts to form the technocratic Palestinian government "while providing the appropriate environment" for it to begin work. The PA - which is dominated by Fatah, Hamas's rival - also expressed support. Vice-President Hussein al-Sheikh said Trump's leadership urged all Palestinian factions, institutions and segments of society to "ensure the success of this critical transitional phase". He also stressed the importance of linking institutions in the West Bank and Gaza in order to uphold "the principle of one system, one law, and one legitimate weapon". According to Trump's plan, the PA will take over governing Gaza once it has completed reforms and can do so "securely and effectively". Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said he had spoken on Wednesday evening with the parents of Ran Gvili, the last dead hostage in Gaza. He made it clear to Itzik and Talik Gvili that "Ran's return is a top priority and that the declaratory move regarding the establishment of a technocratic committee will not affect the efforts to return Ran for a Jewish burial", the office added. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum insisted: "There is no phase 2 while Ran Gvili in Gaza. Phase Rani must come first." The Israeli government had accused Hamas of deliberately delaying the recovery of the 24-year-old police officer's remains and said it will not reopen the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt – one of its obligations under phase one - until they are handed over. Gvili was among the 251 people abducted during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, when about 1,200 other people were killed. Israel responded to the attack by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 71,430 people have been killed, according to the territory's health ministry.

**Excerpt**

Italian influencer Chiara Ferragni cleared of cake fraud An Italian fashion influencer has been acquitted of aggravated fraud, bringing a long-running scandal involving a charity Christmas cake to an end. Chiara Ferragni had been accused of misleading consumers by promoting the sale of a designer pink pandoro as well as Easter eggs that were said to be helping to raise money for a children's hospital and a charity. After a fast-track trial in Milan, a judge found her and two other defendants not guilty. Had she been convicted, she could have faced a jail term. Ferragni, 38, told reporters the judgment marked "the end of a nightmare that lasted two years". The scandal - dubbed "pandorogate" - started with the sale of pink special edition Christmas cakes in 2022. Consumers were led to believe that sales of the pandoro would go towards raising funds for a children's hospital in Turin. But it turned out that the cake's producer, Balocco, had given a one-off €50,000 (£43,300) donation to the hospital before the cake's launch. Ferragni has 28 million followers on Instagram and, after her companies made €1m from the promotion, she pledged to donate the same sum to the hospital. The outcry led authorities to initiate a formal investigation and the influencer was handed a €1m fine in 2023 by Italy's competition authority over the pandoro cakes, branded with her name and mentioning the children's hospital. Ferragni-branded Easter eggs also became part of the scandal, leading the influencer to agree to pay €1.2m to a children's charity to settle complaints that the eggs' sales allegedly misled consumers. She was later indicted on the aggravated fraud charges, along with business associate Fabio Damato. Prosecutors had asked for a sentence of one year and eight months in prison for Ferragni but the judge rejected their accusation that the fraud should be seen as aggravated. The Milan court found that no aggravation had been involved as a consumer group had withdrawn its original complaint. Ferragni had agreed with consumer organisation Codacons that she would compensate consumers and donate money to a charity for women who had suffered gender violence. "We are all moved," Ferragni told reporters at the end of the trial. "The last two years have been very hard. I had faith in justice, and justice has been done." Despite her acquittal the scandal has proved damaging to Ferragni's brand and affected her personal life. Her marriage to Italian rapper Fedez fell apart last year. It has also led to tighter rules for Italian influencers to show greater transparency in their fund-raising initiatives.

'Appropriate and unambiguous': White House defends Trump over middle-finger gesture at heckler The White House has defended US President Donald Trump after he aimed an offensive gesture at a heckler during his appearance at the Ford factory in Detroit on Tuesday. Footage of the incident published by TMZ appears to show Trump responding to a man who shouted at him from afar. The White House said: "A lunatic was wildly screaming expletives in a complete fit of rage, and the President gave an appropriate and unambiguous response." The heckler has been suspended by Ford, the United Auto Workers union told the BBC's US partner, CBS News. Within 24 hours of the incident, two separate GoFundMe pages have raised nearly $700,000 (£521,000) for him from more than 27,000 donors. A Ford spokesperson told CBS: "One of our core values is respect and we don't condone anyone saying anything inappropriate like that within our facilities. "When that happens, we have a process to deal with it but we don't get into specific personnel matters." According to the subtitles provided by TMZ, the heckler called Trump a "paedophile protector". In the clip, which shows Trump from a distance, the president can be seen speaking back at the heckler, allegedly mouthing an expletive as well as using a middle-finger gesture. A man who spoke to The Washington Post, named TJ Sabula, identified himself as the man who shouted. He said he had "no regrets" about what he did. Sabula reportedly said he his remarks referred to Trump's handling of the Epstein files. Trump has faced pressure for more transparency on what was uncovered by federal investigations into Jeffrey Epstein, the late convicted sex offender. Trump signed a law that compelled the Department of Justice (DoJ) to release all the files that it held on Epstein by 19 December, although only a fraction of the files have so far been made public. Trump was once friends with Epstein before they fell out, which Trump says was years before Epstein was first arrested. Trump has not been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein. United Automotive Workers (UAW), the union that represents Sabula, defended his actions, saying: "He believes in freedom of speech, a principle we wholeheartedly embrace, and we stand with our membership in protecting their voice on the job." Trump was in Detroit on Tuesday to give a speech to the Detroit Economic Club. The president's public use of expletives have attracted headlines in the past - for example, when discussing the relationship between Iran and Israel last June. His predecessor Joe Biden also caused controversy for uttering an expletive during a conversation with a worker during his own visit to a factory in Detroit while on the campaign trail in 2020, before he was elected president.

Swiss regions ban pyrotechnics after ski bar fire The Swiss canton of Valais has banned pyrotechnic devices in all indoor public venues following the devastating fire at a bar on New Year's Eve where 40 people were killed and 116 were injured. Authorities said each of the victims would get a 10,000 franc ($12,500; £9,200) emergency payment, with a fund being set up to collect donations. The canton of Geneva also announced a ban on pyrotechnics in indoor venues - days after Vaud became the first of Switzerland's 26 regions to take such a decision. The blaze at Le Constellation bar in the ski resort of Crans-Montana is believed to have started when sparklers attached to champagne bottles set light to sound-insulating foam padding on the ceiling. Authorities have acknowledged that the bar had not undergone safety checks for five years. The two co-owners of Le Constallation, French couple Jacques and Jessica Moretti, have been accused of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence. Jacques Moretti is being held in custody for an initial period of 90 days. His wife has had to surrender her passport and report to police every day. The news that the bar had not been inspected for five years has shocked families of the victims, most of whom were young - eight were under the age of 16. Many of the injured have severe burns. Eighty remain in hospitals in Switzerland and other European countries. One of the lawyers representing families of the victims said on Tuesday that an online platform had been launched to receive testimonies related to the disaster. "This initiative aims to facilitate the investigation for the benefit of the victims," Romain Jordan said - not to replace the official investigation. Among those who have died was the waitress who was seen in a video wearing a helmet and holding a champagne bottle with a sparkler attached and the ceiling catching fire. Identified widely as Cyane Panine, 24, and from Sète in south-east France, she is said to have been close to the managers of the bar. Her family have issued a statement saying: "Whatever the outcome of the investigation, this young woman followed her employers' instructions. She did what the general manager asked her to do. Nothing unusual. This young employee is in no way responsible."

FBI searches home of Washington Post reporter in classified documents probe Agents with the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) raided the home of a Washington Post reporter this week as part of an investigation into a government contractor accused of leaking classified information, officials said. In a post on X, US Attorney General Pam Bondi said agents had searched the home of a journalist who allegedly "was obtaining and reporting classified and illegally leaked information from a Pentagon contractor". Bondi said the contractor had been arrested. The Washington Post identified the reporter to the BBC as Hannah Natanson, who has covered how President Donald Trump's administration has drastically reduced and reshaped the federal workforce. Natanson was at her home in Virginia on Wednesday when federal agents came to search her home, according to the Washington Post. They took her phone, a work and personal computer and a Garmin watch, the outlet said. Natanson was told she was not the focus of the probe, according to the Washington Post, which reported that officials were investigating Aurelio Perez-Lugones, a system administrator in Maryland with top-secret security clearance. According to an FBI affidavit, Perez-Lugones - a systems engineer and information technology specialist on contract for the government since 2002 - accessed and printed classified intelligence reports. Officials said they found classified information in a lunch box while searching Perez-Lugones' car, according to court filings. The filing does not mention Perez-Lugones disseminating the information. The court filings say Perez-Lugones has been charged with unlawful retention of national defence information. He is scheduled to appear in court on Thursday. Bondi said the Trump administration would "not tolerate illegal leaks of classified information that, when reported, pose a grave risk to our Nation's national security and the brave men and women who are serving our country". The search of Natanson's home sparked concerns from press freedom and free speech advocates. "Any search targeting a journalist warrants intense scrutiny because these kinds of searches can deter and impede reporting that is vital to our democracy," Jameel Jaffer, the executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute, said in a statement. Natanson previously wrote about her experience gathering more than 1,000 sources who currently and formerly worked for the federal government, as she reported on the layoffs, buyouts and firings that Trump has used since returning to office to shrink the federal workforce and change the focus of many agencies. Natanson wrote about sources inside government agencies sharing information they "weren't supposed to tell me" and the intensity of receiving sensitive information from so many people. In April, Bondi ended Biden-era policies that had protected journalists from having their phone records seized or being forced to testify in leak probes.

### 11. [Amateur stuns world's best to win A$1m in Melbourne](https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/ckgyl1ndw57o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

Amateur player Jordan Smith would have been "happy winning just one point" - but walked away with A$1m (Â£496,835) and bragging rights over world number two Jannik Sinner as he triumphed at the Australian Open's Million Dollar One Point Slam. The innovative format offered amateur players the opportunity to win the prize money by playing a sole point against some of the sport's top talent and other famous faces. Smith was the star of the show on Rod Laver Arena, also defeating women's world number four Amanda Anisimova in front of almost 15,000 people. Smith faced women's world number 117 Joanna Garland in a fitting finale, after the Taiwanese 24-year-old stunned men's world number three Alexander Zverev and former Wimbledon finalist Nick Kyrgios. New South Wales state champion Smith was not the only amateur to seize his moment in the spotlight, with Queensland state champion Alec Reverente beating men's world number seven Felix Auger-Aliassime. As the two best performing amateurs, Smith and Reverente also went head-to-head to win a brand new car, with Reverente triumphing. The tournament was played in good spirits - even a racquet smash by Kyrgios following his defeat was performed with humour - and generated genuine intrigue. Many of the beaten players, including men's number one Carlos Alcaraz, remained at Rod Laver Arena and gathered around televisions to watch the conclusion between the two unlikely finalists. Upsets, shocks and entertainment at Melbourne Park The opening match set the tone for the evening when tennis coach Andres Schneiter knocked out men's world number 34 Corentin Moutet. The upsets kept on coming across the quick-fire format as fellow players offered enthusiastic support from the side of the court and the crowd rallied behind the underdogs. British-born Garland, who was beaten in the first round of singles qualifying in Melbourne, appeared more stunned than anyone as she beat former women's world number three Maria Sakkari and 2024 Wimbledon semi-finalist Donna Vekic. Smith, meanwhile, did not need to hit a ball against Sinner after the men's world number two failed to land his serve - with professionals only granted one opportunity to get it right. He was not done there, following up victory over Anisimova by beating 71st-ranked Spaniard Pedro Martinez to set up his shot at the prize money. "Coming into tonight I would have been happy winning just one point," said the 29-year-old Smith, who won national titles as a junior. "I was so nervous but enjoyed being out here, it was a great experience." Elsewhere, Sakkari ended Alcaraz's bid after the top-ranked men's player netted an attempted drop shot. Meanwhile six-time major winner Iga Swiatek saw off the men's world number 22 and 31 in Flavio Cobolli and Frances Tiafoe respectively before losing to Martinez. How did the Million Dollar One Point Slam work? The event, held four days before the Australian Open starts on Sunday, featured a total of 48 competitors, including 24 top professionals. Eight amateur winners of state championship rounds, eight players who qualified in Melbourne, and another eight wildcards - including celebrities and invited personalities - made up the rest of the competition. Beginning with a game of 'rock, paper, scissors' to decide who serves, each match consisted of a single point, with the winner progressing in a knockout format. The Australian Open held its inaugural One Point Slam event in 2025, but the prize fund was A$60,000 (Â£29,808) and Russia's Andrey Rublev was the only top-10 player involved. It is the latest attempt by tennis authorities to attract new interest in the sport after the US Open introduced a standalone mixed doubles championship before the main draw last year. 'Roaring success for both underdog and tournament' Analysis by BBC Sport tennis news reporter Jonathan Jurejko At the start of the night, Coco Gauff admitted she didn't want to win the One Point Slam. Instead, the two-time major singles champion wanted an amateur to take home the money. They would be more deserving of a sum which would change their life, she reasoned. Smith, a reserved character who was genuinely lost for words as he was interviewed on court after each win, ended up being the beneficiary. A different future awaits. One as a new homeowner at the very least. Remarkably, it was Smith who possessed the calmest demeanour in the place. He was unruffled by standing across the net from Sinner. He was unflustered by the sight of a box-full of replica cash sitting courtside. He was unperturbed as he traded with Garland from the baseline knowing the vast sum at stake. The innovative event turned out to be masterstroke by Australian Open tournament director Craig Tiley. Superstar players brought gravitas and the possibility of anybody beating anybody added some jeopardy. A virtually full arena boosted income and the event proved popular with fans online. Tiley insisted the boom-or-bust concept was a leveller between Grand Slams and grassroots. The unknown underdog ensured it was the roaring success which both dreamed of.

### 12. [Tehran morgue videos show the brutality of Iran's crackdown on protesters](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly3xpyvxzyo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

Tehran morgue videos show the brutality of Iran's crackdown on protesters Warning: this story contains content which some readers might find distressing Distressing new videos have emerged from a mortuary in Tehran showing rows of bodies, blood soaked floors and crowds of people searching for loved ones following a deadly government crackdown on protesters in Iran. The videos analysed by BBC Verify and BBC Persian, which are too graphic to show, contain some of the most shocking examples so far of how brutal the government's retaliation has been since the unrest began on 28 December. Forensic examination of the footage reveals nearly 200 bodies laid throughout the mortuary complex, many with visible wounds and one victim identified as young as 16. Anti-government demonstrations have spread to more than 68 towns and cities, verified videos show, though the true figure is likely to be much higher. The near total internet blackout imposed by the government since last week has left more than 90 million Iranians almost completely cut off from the outside world. The number of people who have been killed in the protests is not fully known. US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) places the estimate at more than 2,500. An Iranian official previously told Reuters 2,000 people have been killed but claimed "terrorists" were to blame. BBC Verify and BBC Persian have previously reported on images emerging from this mortuary but we are not showing these new videos because the images are too graphic. The footage was posted on Tuesday by Vahid, a US-based Iranian social media influencer and activist, who said they were filmed on 10 January inside the Kahrizak Forensic Medical Centre in south Tehran. Vahid said the videos were filmed by a man who had travelled nearly 1,000km to find internet access. The man told BBC Persian he used mobile networks from neighbouring countries to upload the footage. Vahid has been posting dozens of videos documenting events inside the country for the outside world to see. Two of the videos show rows of body bags on the floor as the man walks up and down a road that runs through the northern section of the vast mortuary complex. He later moves through a courtyard and inside a large warehouse, and walks in and out of adjacent rooms filled with more body bags. At one point he is heard describing the scene as "the apocalypse". The man filming is heard saying, "Today is Saturday, a day after the call". He is referring to the call made by Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the late Shah, for nationwide protests that took place last Thursday and Friday night. Two more clips contain a collection of photos taken from the mortuary showing several bodies wrapped in the zip-up bags, including one which appears burnt. BBC Verify and BBC Persian have counted at least 186 bodies in the five-minute video and at least 178 bodies in the 16-minute clip. The two videos likely show some of the same bodies so we cannot be definitive, but the true figure is likely to be much higher. The videos contain at least nine separate clips edited together. The positions of shadows in the footage indicate these sections were likely filmed at different times throughout the day. We have matched identifiable features from the complex, including separate buildings, the red roof of a warehouse and fences with satellite images on Google. The man films as he moves around inside the centre, where more bodies are kept on stretchers as well as the floor. The footage shows some body bags fully zipped up while others are either half or entirely unzipped, revealing victims' faces and injuries. Some are completely uncovered. We can see blood-soaked towels and sheets scattered around the complex with streaks of blood on the floor. A number of the bodies have visible wounds. Two bodies appear to be soaked in blood, and another is seen with a deep stomach wound. Some body bags have papers attached to them or details written on the body bags in a white marker such as a name, national ID number, date of birth and death, and in some cases their father's name. At least two men are described as unidentified on a sheet of paper attached to their bag, and at least one woman and one teenager are among the victims. The date of death on three of the male victims' body bags states 9 January. Another body bag shows a date of birth using the Iranian calendar. It says 1/1/1388, which corresponds to 21/3/2009, indicating that it belongs to a 16-year-old. During one moment in the 16-minute clip the man points his phone at a building to his right and a voice can be heard saying: "There are many [bodies] inside. It's not possible to go inside… this is the women's area". Iranian mortuaries separate the bodies of men and women for religious reasons. At a different point we can see a body bag at the back of a hearse and a man nearby is heard telling a female official that it is his sister. Several ambulances, hearses and vans are filmed around the grounds. Officials are seen inspecting the rows of bodies, taking swabs from the victims, and talking to potential loved ones. It is not clear why the bodies of those killed in anti-government protests may have been transferred to the centre, but eyewitness accounts provided to BBC Persian suggest hospitals have been overwhelmed with the number of casualties in the protests. HRANA, which has been tracking the death toll since the unrest began, has reported that 2,403 protesters, 147 people affiliated with the government, nine civilians and 12 children have been killed so far. Crowds of people, many who appear to be family members and friends, are seen walking in and out of the complex as they try to identify the bodies. Cries and wails are repeatedly heard throughout the videos as people mourn the loss of their loves ones. "Some of our best people have been killed," the man filming is heard saying. Iranian state TV has since reported that a "substantial" number of bodies had been taken to the mortuary. It claimed the majority of the victims were members of Iran's security forces or passers-by who had nothing to do with the demonstrations. Most international news organisation, including the BBC, are restricted from operating inside the country so we have to rely on verifying footage on social media.

### 13. [Why two Canadian provinces are in a spat over Crown Royal whisky](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8x9v241z2qo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

Why two Canadian provinces are in a spat over Crown Royal whisky A British owned, Canadian-made whisky is at the centre of a spat between two provinces that is testing a unified "Team Canada" approach in the face of US tariffs. It started after the whisky maker, Diageo, said it will shut down a bottling plant in Ontario to move some of it closer to US consumers. Soon after, Ontario Premier Doug Ford angrily poured out a bottle of Crown Royal in front of reporters, and now says the product will be removed from provincial liquor stores. This has alarmed neighbouring Manitoba, where a Crown Royal distillery is a key employer in the small town of Gimli. In a symbolic visit to the Gimli distillery on Tuesday, Manitoba Premier Wab Kinew urged Ford to "do a 180". "We understand, Doug, that you get fired up and say things in public," Kinew said. "But we also understand that you do the right thing when you have a chance to reconsider". The row over Crown Royal – a Canadian whisky brand that was introduced during the 1939 royal tour of Canada by King George VI – dates back to August. That's when Diageo first announced it would close its Amherstburg, Ontario, bottling facility after five decades of operations. The UK-based company said last summer it planned to close the plant in February as part of a broader restructuring to improve its North American supply chain, and – to Ford's dismay – move bottling operations closer to the US. "Here's what I think about Crown Royal," he said shortly after Diageo's announcement, before pouring an entire bottle of the whisky on the ground during a news conference and calling Diageo owners "dumb as a bag of hammers". He then vowed to "hurt" the firm and urged Canadians to boycott the product. The company has said bottling operations for Canada and non-US markets are set to move to a Quebec facility southwest of Montreal. While it has not said it will shift any operations to the US, Ford has speculated that they will. "It's all going to Alabama," he said earlier this month. "Mark my words." Ford also vowed to remove the whisky from the shelves in Ontario, where liquor stores are operated by the province. The Liquor Board of Ontario is the largest wholesale purchaser of alcohol in North America. Crown Royal is its top selling whisky, according to Diageo. Manitoba is now pleading with Ford to change course. The Crown Royal distillery plant is a major driver for business in the town of Gimli, home to about 2,300 people, Premier Kinew said on Tuesday. He warned Ford that he could inadvertently hurt Canadians with the boycott. Diageo employs more than 500 people across Canada, the company told the BBC, including100 in Ontario separate from those working at the Amherstburg site. "When we're talking about Team Canada, we have to stay united across the provinces," Kinew said. "Having a Team Canada approach can't mean targeting jobs in another province." Nicknamed "Captain Canada" by some, Ford has built a reputation for being combative against US tariffs and the job losses they have been linked to in Ontario. Ford notably led a charge to remove US liquor from Canadian stores in retaliation for the levies - a move that has since become a trade irritant for the Trump administration. He has often appeared on major US networks to make the case for free trade between the two countries. More recently, an anti-tariff advertisement commissioned by the province that ran on American TV caused Trump to abruptly halt trade talks with Canada. Still, Ford's reaction to Diageo has been applauded by the local union, which says it represents more than 200 workers at the Amherstburg plant whose future is now uncertain. "This is how you fight a trade war," Unifor National President Lana Payne said in September, after Ford first called for a boycott. But the United Food & Commercial Workers, the union representing Diageo workers outside Ontario, criticised Ford for "stunts" that it says "are directly attacking the livelihoods of hundreds of Canadian workers". Kinew, who enjoys the highest approval rating of any premier in Canada, said he recognised Ford was standing up for Ontarians but noted they "are Canadians, just like the people here in Gimli". He invited Ford to visit Manitoba to discuss the issue over a weekend ice hockey game between Toronto and Winnipeg. "We can settle this thing and just put this episode behind us," Kinew said. Ford has confirmed he received the invite and called Kinew "a fine gentleman". But he did not say if he would take up his offer. As for changing his mind on Crown Royal, he told reporters: "No, I'm not reconsidering."
