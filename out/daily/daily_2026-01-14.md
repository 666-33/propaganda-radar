**Excerpt**

Only Trump can stop Putin, Polish president tells BBC Donald Trump is the only world leader capable of stopping Vladimir Putin from threatening Europe, according to Poland's President Karol Nawrocki. In an interview with Radio 4's Today programme he said the Russian leader was not to be trusted, but that Europe needed to do everything it could to support President Trump in his efforts to end the war in Ukraine. President Nawrocki was already well-known as a firm supporter of Donald Trump even before he landed in Britain for meetings with PM Sir Keir Starmer and others. Now, he says that with Vladimir Putin's Russia threatening his country as well as central and eastern Europe, the US president was the only person who could, as he put it, "solve this problem" – as well as ending the war in Ukraine. Referring to last September's mass incursion by Russian drones, when more than 20 uncrewed aircraft crossed into Poland from Belarus and Ukraine, President Nawrocki called it "an extraordinary situation", adding that "until that time, no Nato member state had experienced a drone attack on that scale". Russia, he said, was testing Poland's defences and testing Nato's solidarity. The Polish president then thanked Britain for sending over RAF Typhoon jets to help defend his borders. He said Poland had been in a state of hybrid war with Russia since 2021, as it dealt with drones and disinformation. This Russian grey zone activity showed "we are living in dangerous times", he added. He was asked about his friendship with Donald Trump, particularly in the light of the US president's threats to take over "by any means" the Danish autonomous territory of Greenland, something which has rattled Europe and which threatens to rupture the 77-year old Nato alliance. The US, he insisted, despite recent statements by US officials to the contrary, was still the guarantor of security in Europe. What Donald Trump was doing on behalf of the Europeans, he said, "deserved support and great respect". President Nawrocki said he could see Europe "detaching" itself from the United States and said this was good neither for the economic security nor the military security of the European Union. That still left the awkward question of Greenland. This discussion, he said, should remain a matter between the Danish prime minister and President Trump. Karol Nawrocki was convinced that this question would be resolved through Nato and through dialogue between Denmark and the US. But President Nawrocki also used this interview to criticise European leaders for, as he put it, being "involved in not so important things, in ideological issues such as green deal for instance, climate policy, migration issues". Europe, he said, was not building its resilience and security over the years, whereas Poland was now allocating close to 5% of its GDP to defence. For Britain, though, he had some warm words. Relations between Poland and the UK were "extremely important" and today around one million Poles lived in the UK. "I would like to express my very deep appreciation for the British soldiers who are stationed in Poland... taking responsibility for Nato's Eastern flank," he said. He expressed his hope that, with Poland's economy growing rapidly, Britain as host of next year's G20 summit would invite Poland to participate.

**Excerpt**

Greenlanders brace for summit that could shape the Arctic's future - and their own It's crunch time. The US Vice President, JD Vance, is hosting the Danish and Greenlandic foreign ministers, as well as their US counterpart, Marco Rubio, in the White House on Wednesday. The focus of the talks: the future of the world's biggest island, Greenland. There is a large digital news ticker tape running above the snow-covered shopping mall in the island's capital, Nuuk. You don't have to speak Greenlandic to understand the words "Trump", "Greenland" and "sovereignty" that appear over and over again, in stark red letters. Donald Trump says he wants this territory and he'll take it "the easy way or the hard way". After his recent controversial military action in Venezuela, people in Greenland are taking him at his word. The anxious countdown to the Washington meeting has been going on for days. Passers-by tell me it feels like years. "I would like to encourage (Donald Trump) to use both his ears wisely, to listen more and to speak less. We are not for sale. Our country is not for sale," Amelie Zeeb said, removing her chunky mittens, traditionally made here with sealskin and known as pualuuk, in order to wave her hands for emphasis. "My hope is for our country to be independent and well-managed and not be bought," said Inuit writer and musician, Sivnîssoq Rask. While Maria, with her seven-week-old baby, wrapped snugly inside her winter coat, told me, "I worry for the future of my young family. We don't want all this attention here!" But international attention on Greenland is not going to disappear anytime soon. Far more hangs in the balance than the fate of this island alone. The tussle over Greenland pits Nato nations Denmark and the US against one another. Greenland is a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark. The Danish prime minister Mette Frederiksen has warned that if the US takes control of the island by force, that will be the end of the transatlantic defence alliance that Europe has relied on for security for decades. It will also be another damaging blow to US-European relations, already badly bruised since Donald Trump's return to the White House. And remember: Europe's leaders are desperate to keep the Trump administration onside, to back a sustainable peace deal for Ukraine too. The potential ramifications of a fallout over Greenland are huge – but it is unclear how Washington intends to handle Wednesday's meeting. Will the spirit be one of compromise or confrontation? President Trump insists he needs Greenland for national security. If the US doesn't take Greenland, then China or Russia will, he says. Mindful of this, major European powers, who have vocally supported Danish sovereignty over Greenland, have also been scrambling to come up with military proposals to boost Nato's presence around the island and in the Arctic more broadly. The UK and Germany have taken the lead here, I'm told. "We share the US concerns that this part of Denmark needs better protection," German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said on Monday. " We simply want to improve Greenland's security situation together." The chairman of the German Reservists Association, Patrick Sensburg, has called for at least one European brigade to be stationed in Greenland as soon as possible. He stressed that Germany would "bear special responsibility in the endeavor", and pointed out that the German army would gain strategic advantages by training soldiers in the challenging Arctic conditions. The British government is also in talks with European allies regarding the possible deployment of military forces to Greenland, particularly in response to perceived threats from Russia and China. What has Nato suggested in terms of security in the Arctic? Talks are at a preliminary stage. Troop numbers have not been defined but the discussions already include the possible deployment of soldiers, warships, aircraft, submarines and anti-drone capabilities in the region. One concrete suggestion is to form a maritime Nato "Arctic Sentry", mirroring the "Baltic Sentry" set up by alliance in the Baltic Sea after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The seabed of both the Baltic and the Arctic are busy with underwater infrastructure, such as energy pipelines and internet cables, critical for communications and billions of dollars worth of financial transactions daily. All vulnerable to hybrid attack. "A lot more can be done in the Arctic," Oana Lungescu told me. Until 2023 she was Nato's longest-serving Nato spokesperson. She's now a Distinguished Fellow with the defence and security think-tank RUSI. "I don't envisage that the UK or Germany will send a significant number of troops to Greenland, but they could hold more exercises in the region or expand existing ones. The UK and other Nato allies have already started deploying maritime assets for a big biannual Norwegian-led exercise in the High North, called Cold Response. The Arctic became a strategic priority for Nato after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. But more needs to be done." Greenland sits between the US and Canada on one side and Russia and Europe on the other. Washington first got a real taste of Greenland's strategic value during the Second World War. The US occupied the island to stop it being taken by Nazi Germany after its invasion of Denmark. The US tried to buy Greenland after the war but Copenhagen refused. Not long after, the two countries became founding members of Nato and in 1951 they signed a defence agreement, still valid today, allowing the United States to keep its military bases on Greenland and to bring as many troops to the island as it wished. Greenland is on the shortest route between continental US and Russia, which makes it key for missile defence. After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the US greatly reduced its presence here, keeping only one military base - Pituffik Space Base - one of Washington's most important radar stations. The coastline here is particularly important. There is a maritime choke-point in the waters between Greenland, Iceland and the UK - the so-called GIUK gap - that's viewed as crucial to keep an eye on Russian and Chinese ships, and especially submarines moving between the Arctic and Atlantic. The US had asked Denmark to boost its surveillance capacity. Copenhagen recently pledged $4 billion for Greenland security though the Trump administration has been dismissive. But will Nato proposals for a bigger, better Arctic presence be enough for the Trump administration? Julianne Smith was the US ambassador to Nato until President Trump's re-election; she is now the president of Clarion Strategies. "This week's meeting is absolutely critical," she told me. "I think it will be a turning point one way or another. The representatives from Denmark and Greenland are coming prepared. "They are taking this moment very seriously, but the real question is whether any of these proposals will actually satisfy a White House that seems more determined and interested in expanding US territory than actually addressing the security of Greenland itself." Is this actually about security? If security was really all that Donald Trump was concerned about, then the Pacific High North is a far more sensitive area of the Arctic for the US than Greenland, argues Ian Lesser, a Distinguished Fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the United States. That's where Russian and US presence and interests come into close contact, he told me. In fact, there are two small islands in the middle of the Bering Strait, where you could potentially walk from the United States to Russia in midwinter. Big Diomede is in Russia, and Little Diomede is in the US state of Alaska. But tensions have risen here since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The waters of the Bering Strait are key to Russia for the transit of strategic nuclear assets and American and Canadian fighter jets have repeatedly been forced to scramble to intercept Russian military planes off the Arctic coast. Ian Lesser believes Donald Trump's focus on Greenland, rather than Alaska, suggests more of an interest in economic security, rather than security in the traditional sense. But, he says, both could be dealt with without touching Danish or Greenlandic sovereignty: Nato could help boost security and defence, and the US could negotiate investment rights in Greenland. Greenland is rich in natural resources, including rare earths and minerals that the US and every other global power crave because of their importance to high-tech industries, including advanced defence technologies. Washington also has its eye on the potential for new, potentially lucrative shipping routes opening up as the Arctic ice melts. But it's hard to see how Donald Trump's appetite for territorial expansionism can leave room for negotiation on Wednesday. These were his words at the beginning of the week: "We're talking about acquiring not leasing.... We have bases on Greenland. I could put a lot of soldiers if I want but you need more than that. You need ownership. You really need title." Greenland is a territory of Denmark and therefore politically European, but geographically, it is part of North America. The island is closer to Washington than Copenhagen and Donald Trump seems to have a keen interest in making America great-er in terms of size and dominance. Most Greenlanders say they want to be independent of Denmark but even more of them (85% in polls) reject the idea of being American. Ahead of Wednesday's meeting in Washington, Greenlandic prime minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said his country faced a geopolitical crisis, "and if we have to choose between the US and Denmark here and now, then we choose Denmark." But however the meeting with the US vice president and secretary of state goes on Wednesday, Donald Trump is the Joker in the pack of cards, says Sara Olvig of Greenland's Centre for Foreign and Security policy. "What will happen will come down to the president," she told me. "And he's very unpredictable. But if the US takes Greenland by coercion, the United States will no longer be the land of the free.. It will be the end of Nato and of the democratic world as we know it." Russia and China will be watching the outcome of Wednesday's meeting, possibly as closely as Greenlanders.

**Excerpt**

No power or water and -19C: Kyiv seeks relief from Russian strikes and cold At a suburban Kyiv railway station, two carriages painted in the blue and white livery of Ukrainian Railways sit on the main platform, their diesel engines running as snow steadily falls. The train is not going anywhere but it is providing a vital service for dozens of people who have been left without power and basics like running water or heating. These are Ukraine's "Invincibility Trains", designed to boost public morale and provide some comfort as a bitter winter coincides with intensifying Russian attacks. In one of the carriages, Alina sits watching her infant son Taras playing with toys provided by international charities who help run the service. "It's winter and it's rather cold outside," says Alina which is something of an understatement. With the effect of the wind-chill, temperatures this week in Kyiv have hit -19C. It is bitterly cold. "I live in a new building on the 17th floor, but we have no elevator, no electricity and no water supply," says Alina. As Taras plays with his toys, she says it is also a relatively safe and comfortable place for her daughter to meet friends. It is also a welcome distraction for Alina, whose husband works all day in a factory, but she suddenly starts to stutter and weep as she tells me about her 54-year-old father who was killed at the front two years ago in a summer offensive near Bakhmut. As she regathers her composure, Alina says she will definitely come back here and welcomes the relief the train brings from the weather and the nightly Russian strikes. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia of deliberately exploiting the bitter winter to target power stations, energy storage facilities and other critical infrastructure. Kyiv's Mayor, Vitali Klitschko, somewhat controversially this week also suggested that city residents, who could, should leave Kyiv to help ease pressure on critical resources. It was a comment seized upon by Russia as a sign of resignation and defeatism. But despite such obvious hardships, most people here in Kyiv remain stoic and are prepared to put up with them. For Yulia Mykhailiuk, Ihor Honcharuk and their one-year-old son Markiian, that means heating building bricks on a gas stove to try to warm up the rest of their small apartment. The flat, in an old Soviet-era apartment block on the east side of the Dnipro river, is a temporary move because their own home was partially damaged in a Russian attack last August. "We've had electricity today for something like four minutes," Ihor tells me. "All of our charging stations and power banks have no energy left in them." "For the first time in a while we have a real winter in Ukraine," says Yulia somewhat ironically. "With this -12 to -16 cold and no heating, the apartment gets cold pretty soon." The large batteries the couple have bought, like many city residents, to charge up when electricity does return are of no use when it comes to heating appliances because they run down so quickly. For now, dressing the baby up in multiple layers of clothing is the only solution, but Yulia says at the weekend they will heed Mayor Klitschko's call and temporarily move away from Kyiv to her parents' home outside the city, although she says it's a decision they have made for themselves and not because of pressure from the mayor's office. The energy crisis is not the only reason to move. Just across the courtyard from their new, temporary home, a recent Russian drone strike hit an apartment block, badly damaging several homes. Kyiv's problems are exacerbated by the fact it has borne so many Russian airstrikes against homes and critical infrastructure installations and, as home to more than three million people, the power shortages impact many people. The most recent Russian attacks against energy installations in the capital and other big cities have had a cumulative effect that is much worse than before. Klitschko said strikes on Monday night had caused the worst electrical outage the city had yet seen, and on Tuesday more than 500 residential buildings were still without power. "Compared to all previous winters, the situation now is the worst," Olena Pavlenko, president of the Kyiv-based think tank DiXi Group, told the Kyiv Independent website. "Every time it's harder to recover. Everything is under ice, and repairs of cables and grids are now two to four times more complicated," she said. Around the clock and across the city, engineers from private energy companies and the municipal authority are repairing power plants hit directly in Russian strikes or installations indirectly affected by them. On another bitterly cold morning we found hardy engineers using mechanical diggers and working with their bare hands to locate and repair damaged power cables which serve the huge multi-occupancy tower blocks on the river's east bank. The city authorities have repeatedly asked people and business not to use high-energy consumption devices because they use so much power, and when the electricity supply returns, the surge in demand for power causes the system to collapse – hence the damaged power cables we saw being repaired. But the engineer in charge here acknowledged it was a temporary fix. "It will take years and years. We are currently working literally in emergency modes," says Andrii Sobko from DTEK Grids repair crew. "The equipment is literally operating at its critical parameters so that at least the residents have light." As the war drags on, it's hard to find anyone in Ukraine who has not been directly impacted by the conflict. Stanislav or "Stas" has also come down to the Invincibility Train to get warm, meet friends and get some power for his phone. The eleven-year-old says his home is very cold and there'd recently been no power in the family's apartment for 36 hours. He recalls with clarity the opening day of the war almost four years ago when he could see bright flashes in the sky - a "bright orb" - as Russia launched its attacks. These days it is the threat of Russian drones that keeps him awake at night. "When I hear something flying it's really scary, because you don't know if it will explode now, or if it will fly on and you survive." As we perch on the top bunk of the carriage where he is sitting with another friend, Stas is frank about the impact of the war on his generation. "I forget the times when there was no war, I don't remember those moments – life is difficult," says Stas, his smile wide and demeanour remarkably bubbly. There are all kinds of people seeking warmth, comfort or company on the train. But my next conversation with an elderly lady, who says her discomfort is nothing compared with what soldiers on the front are enduring, is abruptly cut short as the familiar high-pitched sound of an air raid alert rings out on our phones. The conductor orders everyone off the train and directs them to a shelter, about a kilometre away. Most head home instead, to the cold and their interrupted power supplies but all - including Stas and Alina - say they'll be back tomorrow. Everyone in Kyiv is putting a brave face on things. This extraordinarily cold winter, even by Ukrainian standards, will not last for much more than a couple of months and the energy crisis will ease. What most people fear is that, despite some optimism at the end of last year, there is no end in sight to the war itself and the inevitable loss of life.

Claudette Colvin, US civil rights pioneer, dies at 86 Claudette Colvin, who helped end racial segregation in the US by refusing to give up her bus seat to a white person, has died. She was 86 years old. Colvin's protest, which led to her arrest, came in 1955 at the age of 15 while she was living in Montgomery, Alabama. It happened nine months before the arrest of Rosa Parks, who also famously refused to give her bus seat to a white person, in a move that led to widespread boycotting of public transportation in the city, and a Supreme Court decision that outlawed such racial discrimination. Colvin's arrest was largely unknown until 2009, when the first detailed book about her experience was published. "She leaves behind a legacy of courage that helped change the course of American history," said a statement from the Claudette Colvin Legacy Foundation, which announced her death. One year after her arrest, the US Supreme Court ruled that segregation on buses must end. The legal case turned on the testimony of four plaintiffs, one of whom was Colvin. In an interview with the BBC in 2018, Ms Colvin recalled that she "was not frightened, but disappointed and angry" because she knew she "was sitting in the right seat". She was the first person to be arrested for challenging Montgomery's bus segregation policies, but her story remained relatively unknown for decades. It was Rosa Parks who became one of the main figures of the civil rights movement after her very similar case led to the large-scale boycott of the bus system in the city. Colvin said she had been inspired by the great anti-slavery campaigners Harriet Tubman and Sojourner Truth. "Whenever people ask me: 'Why didn't you get up when the bus driver asked you?' I say it felt as though Harriet Tubman's hands were pushing me down on one shoulder and Sojourner Truth's hands were pushing me down on the other shoulder," she told the BBC. Later in life, she became a nurse in New York. According to her organisation, she died in Texas.

K-pop drum duet between Japan and South Korea's leaders caps off summit talks A surreal drum duet between two East Asian world leaders has set the internet abuzz - and put a spotlight on Japan and South Korea's diplomatic relationship. Decked out in matching blue jackets, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung and Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi on Tuesday played drums to the beats of K-pop hits - including Dynamite by BTS and Golden from hit film KPop Demon Hunters. The performance, a nod to Takaichi's past life as a drummer in a heavy metal band, wrapped up Lee's official visit to Japan this week. It's also part of Lee's diplomatic overtures to regional powers including Japan, with whom South Korea has a fraught history but shares a security alliance. The drumming session from Tuesday, which Lee described as "a little clumsy", has now spawned a viral video. During Lee's visit to Nara, Takaichi's hometown, he gifted the Japanese prime minister a drum set. The two leaders also exchanged signed drumsticks after their performance. "When we met at APEC last year, [Lee] said it was his dream to play the drums, so we prepared a surprise," Takaichi later wrote on X. Footage of the jam session has won praise on social media. "Music seems to have the power to connect hearts at a deeper level than words ever could," one X user wrote in Korean. "Exchanges like this may be quiet, but they will surely help move relations between Korea and Japan forward." There have long been sore spots between the two neighbours, including historical grievances from Japan's colonial rule and territorial disputes. But both countries are allies of the US, and have worked together to counter China's increasing assertiveness in the region. On Tuesday, Takaichi said in a statement that cooperation between Japan, South Korea and the US has become increasingly important amid heightened tensions in the region's "strategic environment". Lee and Takaichi have also agreed to boost economic cooperation - a pledge that comes as China has been tightening its export of rare earths and dual-use goods to Japan. "Just seeing them actually playing drums together - not just posing - looks like they are having so much fun, and that's what matters most," an X user wrote in Japanese. "Both Korea and Japan are facing tough situations, but if we can meet each other halfway, I truly believe things will move in a positive direction." Lee's smoothness as a diplomat has boosted his approval ratings back home. Days before his viral jam session with Takaichi, he met Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing, with whom he took selfies on a Chinese smartphone. Last October, he flattered US President Donald Trump with a large golden crown. The only leader he hasn't been able to charm is North Korea's Kim Jong Un. Pyongyang has rejected Lee's overtures for peace and shown little interest in reconciliation. This week, Pyongyang demanded an apology from Seoul after accusing it of flying surveillance drones in its territory. Lee's rise to become president of South Korea had previously sounded alarm bells in Tokyo and Washington. Relatively unknown outside his own country at the time, Lee had a reputation as a firebrand who was sympathetic to socialist economic causes. The US feared South Korea would tilt towards China, South Korea's largest trading partner. Japan, meanwhile, feared a repeat of a spat in 2019, when South Korea threatened to pull out of an intelligence-sharing agreement after Japan tightened its exports to the country. That fight broke out after a South Korean court ordered Japanese companies to compensate the survivors of Japan's wartime forced labour, an issue Japan now considers resolved. Since taking office, however, Lee has walked a diplomatic tightrope among the region's major powers, from the US to China and now Japan. Lee heaped praise on Takaichi's drumming skills in a post on X, and likened their diplomatic efforts to the musical duet. "Even if our timing was slightly different, our intention to find the same rhythm was shared," he wrote. "In that same spirit, we will continue to build a future-oriented Korea–Japan relationship together, with one heart."

**Excerpt**

Venezuela has freed some American citizens from prison, US official says Venezuela has started releasing multiple Americans detained across the country, according to a US state department official. The official did not confirm the identities or number of prisoners released by Venezuela, but in a statement called the move "an important step in the right direction by the interim authorities". It is the first known release of American citizens since a US military operation seized Nicolás Maduro and his wife during a raid in the capital Caracas on 3 January, to face drug trafficking charges in New York. The UN says Venezuela has so far released about 50 prisoners of what human rights groups estimate are 800 political prisoners detained in the country. The Venezuelan government, led by Interim President Delcy Rodríguez, announced last week it would start releasing "a significant" number of people considered political prisoners as a "goodwill gesture". Some domestic opposition figures and at least five Spanish citizens are among those confirmed to have been freed so far. Over the weekend, Donald Trump wrote on his Truth Social account that the process of freeing detainees in Venezuela had begun "in a BIG WAY". Trump said he cancelled a second wave of airstrikes on Venezuela once he learned Caracas was cooperating with the release of prisoners. The developments are being viewed as the first test of Trump's influence in Venezuela following the removal of Maduro. However, the interim government has been accused of failing to maintain its promise to release political detainees, including by Ramón Guanipa, whose father is a politician who remains imprisoned. Guanipa told the BBC that Trump should "not be fooled" by the gestures of the authorities until all political prisoners are released. Human rights groups and political activists have long accused the government of using detentions to muzzle its critics. Officials repeatedly denied Venezuela held any political prisoners, insisting they were arrested for criminal activity. Many were detained after the 2024 presidential election, where Maduro claimed victory despite opponents disputing the results.

**Excerpt**

Global temperatures dipped in 2025 but more heat records on way, scientists warn Global temperatures in 2025 did not quite reach the heights of 2024, thanks to the cooling influence of the natural La Niña weather pattern in the Pacific, new data from the European Copernicus climate service and the Met Office shows. But the last three years were the world's warmest ever recorded, bringing the planet closer to breaching international climate targets. Despite natural cooling from La Niña, 2025 was still much warmer than temperatures even a decade ago, as humanity's carbon emissions continue to heat the planet. That will inevitably lead to further temperature records – and worsening weather extremes – unless emissions are sharply reduced, scientists warn. "If we go twenty years into the future and we look back at this period of the mid-2020s, we will see these years as relatively cool," said Dr Samantha Burgess, deputy director of Copernicus. The global average temperature in 2025 was more than 1.4C above "pre-industrial" levels of the late 1800s - before humanity started burning large amounts of fossil fuels - according to Copernicus and Met Office data. The precise figures vary slightly between major climate groups, owing mainly to small differences in how the pre-industrial temperature is calculated. But there is no debate about the world's long-term warming trend. "We understand very well that if we continue to pump greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, the concentrations of those gases increase in the atmosphere, and the planet responds by warming," explained Prof Rowan Sutton, director of the Met Office Hadley Centre. Last year might not have been the hottest on record worldwide but extreme weather events linked to global warming continued. The continued warmth brings the world closer to breaching the international target to try to limit the rise in global temperatures to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. That was agreed by nearly 200 countries in 2015, with the aim of avoiding some of the much more severe consequences of climate change that 2C of warming would bring. "Looking at the most recent data, it looks like we'll exceed that 1.5 degree level of long-term warming by the end of this decade," said Burgess. While long-term warming is the result of human activities, individual years can be slightly warmer or cooler because of natural variability. One such variable is the switch between the weather patterns El Niño and La Niña. They primarily affect weather in the Pacific but have a knock-on effect on temperatures worldwide. El Niño years tend to be warmer as a global average, while La Niña years are typically cooler. The return of La Niña conditions is thought to have suppressed warmth in 2025. But the fact that temperatures have remained so high in a La Niña year "is a little worrying", according to Dr Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist at Berkeley Earth in the US. The last three years have seen global temperature records broken by significant margins. As the chart below shows, records for each month of the year have been set since 2023, according to Copernicus data. The size of the jump in temperatures in 2023 surprised many scientists – sparking speculation about what might be behind the surge, in addition to carbon emissions and El Niño. Theories include changes to clouds and tiny particles called aerosols, which appear to be reflecting less of the Sun's energy back into space. The persistence of extreme warmth into 2025 "suggests that there might be some mysteries that we haven't fully solved", said Hausfather. "We are seeing rapid warming at the upper end of our longer-term expectations," agreed Sutton. But whether the last three years have significiant implications for the longer term "is not yet clear", he added, with more data needed before making firm conclusions. While scientists expect more records to be broken in the years ahead, they emphasise that the future impacts of climate change are not set in stone. "We can strongly affect what happens," said Sutton, "both by mitigating climate change - that's by cutting greenhouse gas emissions to stabilise warming - and of course also by adapting, by making society more resilient to ongoing changes."

Actor Kiefer Sutherland arrested over alleged assault of ride-share driver Actor Kiefer Sutherland has been arrested after allegedly assaulting and threatening a ride-share driver in Hollywood, police have said. Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) said Sutherland "entered a ride-share vehicle, physically assaulted the driver (the victim), and made criminal threats" in an incident at 00:15 PST (08:15 GMT) on Monday. The victim was not injured in the incident, the LAPD added. Sutherland, 59, was released after paying a bond of $50,000 (£37,000). He is due to appear in court on 2 February. The BBC has contacted his representatives for comment. The incident took place at the intersection of Sunset Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue in Hollywood and is under investigation by the LAPD's Hollywood Division. Sutherland, known for roles such as special agent Jack Bauer on Fox's 24, and as the US president in Designated Survivor, is the son of actor Donald Sutherland. The British-Canadian actor has been arrested several times in the past, and in 2007 he was sentenced to 48 days in jail for driving under the influence and violating probation. He was arrested for assault in 2009, although the charge was later dropped, and was most recently arrested after making an illegal U-turn in Hollywood in 2020.

US approves sale of Nvidia's advanced AI chips to China The US government has given chip giant Nvidia the green light to sell its advanced artificial intelligence (AI) processors in China, the Department of Commerce said on Tuesday. The H200, Nvidia's second-most-advanced semiconductor, had been restricted by Washington over concerns that it would give China's technology industry and military an edge over the US. The Commerce Department said the chips can be shipped to China granted that there is sufficient supply of the processors in the US. President Donald Trump said last month that he would allow the chip sales to "approved customers" in China and collect a 25% fee. Nvidia's spokesperson told the BBC that the company welcomed the move, saying it will benefit manufacturing and jobs in the US. The Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security said its revised export policy applies to Nvidia's H200 chips, as well as less advanced processors. Chinese customers must also show "sufficient security procedures" and cannot use the chips for military uses. The H200 chip is a generation behind Nvidia's Blackwell processor, which is considered to be the world's most advanced AI semiconductor and remains blocked from sale in China. Chinese embassy spokesman Liu Pengyu told the BBC on Wednesday that Beijing has consistently opposed the "politicisation and weaponisation of tech and trade issues". "We oppose blocking and restricting China, which disrupts the stability of industrial and supply chains," he said. "This approach does not serve the common interests of both sides." Nvidia has been caught in a geopolitical tug-of-war between the US and China - two sides of a global AI race. Trump reversed the chip-selling restriction last July, but demanded that Nvidia pay a cut of its earnings from China to the US government. Beijing then reportedly ordered its tech companies to boycott Nvidia's China-bound chips and prioritise semiconductors made domestically. That move was designed to bolster China's tech industry, though experts have consistently said that the country's chips still lag behind the US. Throughout 2025, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang continually lobbied Washington to allow the sale of the firm's high-powered chips to China, arguing that global market excess is essential for America's competitiveness. Some officials in the US, however, have expressed concerns that the chips would benefit Beijing's military and hurt America's progress in AI development. While Beijing is likely concerned about domestic firms becoming over-reliant on Nvidia, local firms will be eager to secure H200 chips - at least until homegrown alternatives get better, said semiconductor analyst Austin Lyons. Nvidia will also be happy to get any revenue from China, even if it comes at a lower margin due to the US government taking a cut of the sales, Lyons added. Trump's "unique" proposal to collect a cut of Nvidia's sales could also set a precedent for his negotiations in other trade tariffs, said Marc Einstein from Counterpoint Research. "It will be interesting to see if this tariff model expands to other sectors."

World central bank chiefs 'stand in solidarity' with US Fed chair Powell Central banks across the world have joined together to declare that they stand in "full solidarity" with the Federal Reserve's chair after the US launched a criminal investigation into Jerome Powell. The heads of the Bank of England, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Canada are among 11 senior bankers who have signed a statement highlighting the importance of independence in setting interest rates. "Chair Powell has served with integrity, focused on his mandate and an unwavering commitment to the public interest," they said. The Department of Justice is conducting the probe. President Donald Trump has said he did not "know anything" about the investigation. The probe is linked to testimony Powell gave to a Senate committee about renovations to Federal Reserve buildings. It follows a year of relentless attacks on the Fed chair by Trump, who has pushed the Fed to lower borrowing costs more aggressively. As well as criticising Powell's decisions on interest rates, Trump has made personal comments, calling the Fed chair a "major loser" and a "numbskull". Commenting on the Fed chair, the global central bankers said in their joint statement: "To us, he is a respected colleague who is held in the highest regard by all who have worked with him." Until the weekend, Powell had stayed largely silent in the face of Trump's attacks but on Sunday, he publicly pushed back and warned that the independence of the US central bank was at stake. "This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions, or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation," Powell said. The Fed has cut interest rates three times since September, leaving its key lending rate at around 3.6%. But policymakers are divided about what to do next. Some are worried additional reductions could stoke inflation, which continues to bubble. Consumer prices rose 2.7% over the 12 months to December, according to official figures published on Tuesday. That was the same rate as in November and remained higher than the Fed's 2% target. In their joint statement on Tuesday, the international financial institutions said: "The independence of central banks is a cornerstone of price, financial and economic stability in the interest of the citizens that we serve. "It is therefore critical to preserve that independence, with full respect for the rule of law and democratic accountability." Powell, who Trump nominated as Fed chair in 2017 during his first term in the White House, is set to step down in May. Trump is expected to name his successor in the coming weeks. Several Republicans have spoken out against the justice department's move against the Fed. North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis, a Republican who is a member of the Senate Banking Committee, said he would oppose the nomination of Powell's replacement by Trump, and any other Fed Board nominee, until the matter was "fully resolved". The committee must approve the next Fed nominee so if Tillis keeps that pledge, it could delay the nomination of any Trump pick to replace Powell. His Republican colleague on the committee, Senator Kevin Cramer, said he thought Powell was a poor Fed chairman but did not believe he was a criminal. To restore confidence in the Fed, he added, the investigation should be swift. Another Republican senator, Lisa Murkowski, described the investigation as "an attempt at coercion". Powell has also been backed by three former chairs of the Fed - Janet Yellen, Ben Bernanke and Alan Greenspan. A number of other eminent former officials have publicly declared their support for him and the bank's independence. Yellen, who was Powell's immediate predecessor, said the criminal investigation was "extremely chilling", adding that investors should be concerned. "You have a president that says the Fed should be cutting rates to lower rate payments on the federal debt… It is the road to banana republic," she told CNBC. The signatories in full are: Andrew Bailey, governor of the Bank of England - Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank - Erik Thedéen, governor of Sveriges Riksbank - Christian Kettel Thomsen, chairman of the Danmarks Nationalbank - Martin Schlegel, chairman of the Swiss National Bank - Michele Bullock, governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia - Tiff Macklem, governor of the Bank of Canada - Chang Yong Rhee, governor of the Bank of Korea - Gabriel Galípolo, governor of the Banco Central do Brasil - François Villeroy de Galhau, chair of the Bank for International Settlements - Pablo Hernández de Cos, general manager of the Bank for International Settlements -

A Dubai chocolate-inspired dessert has taken S Korea by storm You must have heard of Dubai chocolate: the sticky, indulgent confectionary filled with pistachio cream, tahini and shreds of knafeh pastry, which has become a global sensation. Now the decadent bar has inspired South Korea's latest dessert craze. The Dubai chewy cookie has been selling like wildfire - and even restaurants that don't usually offer baked goods are trying to get a nibble of the market. Despite its name, the cookie's texture more closely resembles a rice cake, and is made by stuffing pistachio cream and knafeh shreds into a chocolate marshmallow. Shops are selling hundreds of cookies within minutes and the frenzy has sent prices of key ingredients surging, local media reported. This South Korean twist on the viral Dubai dessert first took off last September, after Jang Won-young from the girl band Ive posted a photograph of the chewy cookie on Instagram. While they currently sell for between 5,000 ($3; £2.5) and 10,000 won, prices are expected to climb due to strong demand. And apart from dessert shops and bakeries, other restaurants - from sushi bars to cold-noodle shops - are now offering the dessert. Local convenience store chain CU launched its Dubai chewy rice cake in October, and has sold some 1.8 million pieces of it in the last few months. "Our manufacturing plant's production capacity cannot keep up with demand," a company representative told Yonhap News. So obsessed are the South Koreans with the cookie that someone even created a map that tracks shops selling the dessert, as well as their stock levels, in real time. Some stores have started imposing limits on how many cookies each customer can buy. The trend has also sparked online chatter among gig workers on whether hardware stores and cleaning companies should also start cashing in on Dubai chewy cookies, The Korea Herald reported. Such demand has driven up the price of pistachios, with local media reporting that a major supermarket chain has raised prices by 20% this year. Counterfeits have also emerged, spurring some consumers to call them out in their online reviews. "I bought two for 11,000 Korean won, but there's no knafeh, and the exterior isn't marshmallow. It's heartbreaking," wrote one, in a review quoted by The Chosun Daily. Several food critics say the Dubai chewy cookies have taken off in South Korea because of how thick and dense they are. "It reflects Korean food culture, where visual overwhelmingness matters more than balance or harmony of ingredients and flavours," food critic Lee Yong-jae told The Chosun Daily.

Bowen: Authoritarian regimes die gradually then suddenly, but Iran is not there yet How does an authoritarian regime die? As Ernest Hemingway famously said about going broke – gradually then suddenly. The protesters in Iran and their supporters abroad were hoping that the Islamic regime in Tehran was at the suddenly stage. The signs are, if it is dying, it is still at gradual. The last two weeks of unrest add up to a big crisis for the regime. Iranian anger and frustration have exploded into the streets before, but the latest explosion comes on top of all the military blows inflicted on Iran in the last two years by the US and Israel. But more significant for hard-pressed Iranians struggling to feed their families has been the impact of sanctions. In the latest blow for the Iranian economy, all the UN sanctions lifted under the now dead 2015 nuclear deal were reimposed by the UK, Germany and France in September. In 2025 food price inflation was more than 70%. The currency, the rial, reached a record low in December. While the Iranian regime is under huge pressure, the evidence is that it's not about to die. Crucially, the security forces remain loyal. Since the Islamic revolution in 1979 the Iranian authorities have spent time and money creating an elaborate and ruthless network of coercion and repression. In the last two weeks, the regime's forces obeyed orders to shoot their fellow citizens in the streets. The result is that the demonstrations of the last few weeks have ended - as far as we can tell in a country whose rulers continue to impose a communications black out. At the forefront of the suppression of protest is the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), the most important single organisation in the country. It has the specific task of defending the ideology and system of government of the Islamic revolution of 1979, answering directly to the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The IRGC is estimated to have something like 150,000 men under arms, operating as a parallel force to Iran's conventional armed military. It is also a major player in the Iranian economy. A potent mix of power, money, corruption and ideology means it has every reason to defend the system. The IRGC has an auxiliary force, the Basij militia, a volunteer paramilitary organisation. It claims to have millions of members. Some western estimates put its active duty contingent in the hundreds of thousands, still a very substantial total. The Basij are at the sharp end of the regime's crackdowns against protesters. I saw the IRGC and the Basij in action in Tehran in 2009, as they moved to suppress huge demonstrations that followed a disputed presidential election. Basij volunteers lined the streets armed with rubber truncheons and wooden clubs. Behind them were uniformed men with automatic weapons. Motorcycle squads roared around Tehran's broad avenues, descending on groups trying to protest. In less than two weeks, protests that had choked the streets were reduced to small groups of students chanting slogans and setting fire to rubbish skips. At dusk, people went to their balconies and rooftops to chant God is greatest, as their parents had against the Shah, until that petered out too. The seeming resilience of the internal security forces does not mean that the supreme leader or his lieutenants can or will relax. US President Donald Trump is still threatening to take action. The millions of Iranians who want the fall of the regime must be seething with resentment and anger. In Tehran, the government and the supreme leader appear to be looking for ways to release some of the pressure they are facing. Bellicose official rhetoric is mixed with an offer to resume negotiations with the US. It is hard to see how the two sides can make a deal over Iran's nuclear plans and ballistic missile programme that have defeated earlier rounds of talks. But negotiations could buy time for Iran, especially if Trump can be convinced that a deal, however unlikely, is possible. As part of his pressure campaign, Trump says that he will slap a 25% tariff on the goods of any country that does business with Iran. Again, it is hard to see how that might work. China buys most of Iran's oil. Trump and China's President Xi Jinping agreed a truce in their trade war last autumn, with a summit due to be held in Beijing in April. The summit will deal with the biggest issues facing the world's two superpowers. Would Trump want to jeopardise or disrupt the summit simply to keep up pressure on Iran? In Tehran the biggest priority for the ageing Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei is to preserve the Islamic Republic's system of rule. More eruptions of protest can expect a severe response. An advantage for the regime is lack of coherent leadership among protesters. The eldest son of the Shah deposed by the revolution almost half a century ago has been trying to be the leader they lack. His appeal seems to be limited by his family's history and his close links with Israel. One lesson that might worry the clerics and military men in Tehran comes from their erstwhile ally, former President Bashar al-Assad of Syria. He seemed to have won his war, and was being slowly rehabilitated by Saudi Arabia and the Arab League when he was faced at the end of 2024 with a well organised rebel offensive. Both Russia and Iran, his two most important allies were neither willing or perhaps able to save him. Within days, Assad and his family were flying into exile in Moscow. An authoritarian regime decays gradually, then suddenly. When Assad's Syria collapsed, it went very fast. Another example that might be studied in Tehran is the downfall in 2011 of President Ben Ali of Tunisia, when the army moved to protect protesters from the internal security forces. The fall of Ben Ali precipitated the resignation of Hosni Mubarak of Egypt. He might have survived huge demonstrations had not the armed forces decided that to save their own position he had to go. Could that happen in Iran? Perhaps. Not yet. Opponents of the Islamic regime will hope for more pressure at home and abroad and the emergence of credible leadership, so that the process of decay will speed up, accelerating from gradual, to sudden.

**Excerpt**

Canada's Mark Carney faces delicate balancing act in China visit Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney is en route to China for a pivotal visit aimed at resetting ties with Beijing and finding new economic opportunities for his country outside the US. It will not be an easy task, with pressure on Canada to balance its goal of diversifying trade without risking damage to its relationship with Donald Trump or compromising national security and human rights commitments. But with ongoing uncertainty over Canada's trade future with the US – its largest customer – the country now finds itself seeking to repair strained relations to protect its economy. Senior Canadian officials have described the trip, the first to China by a Canadian prime minister since 2017, as "consequential and historic" and part of a "bold" plan to double Canada's non-US exports over the next decade. Trade will be on the agenda, along with agriculture and international security, Carney's office said. Beijing's foreign ministry said the two countries have "shared interests" and should work to "increase people-to-people ties and cultural exchanges". On Thursday, Carney meets the Premier of China, Li Qiang, as well as the Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China, Zhao Leji. On Friday, the prime minister is scheduled to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping one-on-one, after the pair met last year on the sidelines of an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea. This official visit is a significant step in the rapprochement after Canada-China relations hit a low in 2018, following the arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver on a US warrant on fraud charges related to Iran sanctions violations. The detention in Canada of the executive of a Chinese telecom giant angered Beijing, and China subsequently arrested two Canadians on espionage charges. All three were released in 2021 after Meng cut a deal with US prosecutors. More recently, China has been accused of meddling in Canada's politics, though a public inquiry on foreign interference found its impact in recent federal elections to be minimal. China has repeatedly denied allegations of foreign meddling. Canada and China have struggled to forge meaningful ties in the past. Ottawa views China as "an increasingly disruptive global power" that "increasingly disregards" international rules and norms, though it recognises China's size and influence make some cooperation necessary. The Carney government does not see this upcoming visit as a deviation from that view, senior Canadian government officials told reporters this week. But they added that Canada cannot achieve its objective of reducing economic reliance on the US without increasing trade with China. Carney is said to be approaching talks with an eye on increasing collaboration in areas of mutual interest like energy and climate, and putting guardrails on areas where the two countries clash, like defence and critical minerals. "I think we are approaching the relationship now with the realism that we haven't seen for decades," Colin Robertson, a former Canadian diplomat, told the BBC. Robertson added that it could result in a "healthier relationship if both sides understand where they're coming from and what the red lines are". It has already proven to be a careful line to walk. Ahead of Carney's visit, two Liberal MPs cut a sponsored trip to Taiwan short, telling the Globe and Mail newspaper that while Canada's position on Taiwan "has not changed", the trip ended early to "avoid confusion with its foreign policy, given the overlap with the Prime Minister's engagement in Beijing". One of Canada's main objectives during this trip is to ease Chinese tariffs on Canadian canola that have hurt farmers in the country's prairie provinces. China last year imposed the agriculture tariffs in a move widely seen as retaliation for Canadian levies on Chinese electric vehicles announced in 2024, mirroring similar levies by the US. In an editorial this week, state-run newspaper Global Times pointed to frustration expressed by Canadian farmers, suggesting "perhaps this was the heavy price (Canada) paid for blindly following the US". China has made it clear it wants the tariffs on EVs lifted. For China, Canada is seen as an important trading partner, with trade between the two countries valued at around $118bn in 2024. But crucially for Beijing, if President Xi manages to make a deal with Carney, it would give China more influence in a country that is on America's doorstep. The Global Times op-ed called on Ottawa to set a foreign policy path separate from that of the US and to exercise "strategic autonomy". One big unknown about this visit is how the US would react to any deals struck between Canada and China. Canada's economy has been hit by US tariffs, especially those on its steel, aluminium and automotive sectors. Talks to ease those levies remain on pause. Canada will soon, however, be engaged in consequential talks on renewing a long-standing North American free trade agreement with the US and Mexico that has shielded it from the bulk of Trump's sweeping tariffs. That review is set to be completed later this year. Robertson, the former diplomat, said it is likely that the Americans are watching the Canada-China relationship "very closely", and that Canada is keeping the US "well informed" of its intentions. But he added: "At the end of the day, there's Canadian interests that we're pursuing." With additional reporting from Jessica Murphy in Toronto.

**Excerpt**

'Welcome to 2976' - North Africa's Amazigh people ring in the new year Across North Africa, the Amazigh people have been coming together to usher in the year 2976. They have, unfortunately, not cracked time travel. Rather, they are almost a thousand years ahead of much of the world because they follow a calendar that starts at 950 BC, when King Sheshonq ascended the throne of Egypt. The Amazigh new year, known as Yennayer, begins between 12 and 14 January - depending on the area in which they live in Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia and Libya - so over the last few days families have been laying on huge feasts, lighting bonfires and playing traditional music. Calls of "aseggas ameggaz", or happy new year, have been ringing through villages and busy city streets, while vibrant, meticulously embroidered traditional clothing has been donned for the occasion. The Amazigh (which means "free people" or "noble people") are a range of ethnic groups that are North Africa's original inhabitants, having occupied the region since the beginning of recorded history. The exact size of the population is not known because of a dearth of official statistics, but according to estimates there are tens of millions of Amazigh people living across North Africa. Algeria and Morocco have the biggest populations - the latter is thought to be 40% Amazigh. Yennayer centres on family gatherings, celebrating renewal and the deep connection the Amazigh people have traditionally had with nature. Because the Amazigh are a diverse group, traditional Yennayer food differs from country to country and area to area. In Morocco's High Atlas region, "ourkemen", a rich mixture of legumes, spices and whole grains, is a new year's favourite. Many families in Algeria enjoy "trèze", a combination of sweets, dried fruit and nuts, after the main meal. The snack mix is sometimes gently thrown over the youngest child in a symbol of prosperity. But Yennayer is not just a family thing. It can also be celebrated with the wider community - parades, concerts and carnivals take the new year's spirit out on to the streets. Such proud displays of Amazigh culture are particularly significant as the community has a long history of being marginalised. In the 7th Century, as Arab conquerors swept across North Africa, they brought with them their language and the Islamic religion. Both of these were adopted officially, at the expense of Amazigh languages and culture. For instance, during Colonel Muammar Gaddafi's rule of Libya, the Amazigh language Tamazight was banned in schools and parents were not even allowed to give their children Amazigh names. However, thanks to the dogged campaigning of Amazigh activists, their culture and language has seen greater recognition over the past decade. In 2011, Morocco recognised Tamazight as an official language. Both Algeria and Morocco also declared Yennayer a public holiday, in 2017 and 2023 respectively. So Yennayer marks not just a victory for the Amazigh people, but also a reminder of centuries-long fight that has got the community to where it is now - in 2976.

**Excerpt**

A crumbling system is depriving India's young offenders of a 'second chance' Pooja* was 16 years old when she was accused of murdering her mother. The teenager, who lived with her alcoholic stepfather in a poor neighbourhood in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, was arrested in 2018 and sent to jail. Her lawyer told the police that Pooja was a minor. According to Indian law, she should have been produced before a Juvenile Justice Board (JJB) - a three-member bench that deals with matters concerning children in conflict with the law - within 24 hours of her arrest. But this was not done, Yamina Rizvi, a lawyer who took over Pooja's case in 2024, told the BBC. JJBs, which comprise of a principal magistrate and two social workers, decide if a child aged 16-18 should be tried as an adult in case of heinous crimes - a provision introduced in India's Juvenile Justice law after the 2012 Delhi gang rape case. But instead of appearing before a JJB, Pooja was lodged in a prison for six years while her case was heard in an adult court. "JJBs are also required to make regular visits to prisons to check if minors have been lodged there. But not a single check was conducted while Pooja was in prison," Rizvi alleges. In 2024, Pooja's case was finally transferred to a JJB, which found that she was indeed a minor at the time of the alleged crime. She was released on time served as the maximum sentence for a juvenile is three years and Pooja had already spent six years in prison. "Pooja is one of thousands of children who have been let down by the juvenile justice system," Rizvi says. It has been nearly four decades since India passed its first comprehensive legislation to deal with children in conflict with the law - the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act. It has been amended several times since then to strengthen its provisions. The law aims to protect children and create opportunities for reform so that they can reintegrate into society and live meaningful lives. But experts who work with children say that there is a long way to go before the system can properly implement the ideals the law preaches. Delhi gang rape: Second chance for teenage rapist? - Should teen sex be a crime? Indian woman lawyer mounts challenge - Four Indian men executed for 2012 Delhi bus rape and murder - The strength of India's juvenile justice system depends heavily on the health of its JJBs - quasi-judicial panels tasked with ensuring that a child's rights are protected even as they face the legal consequences of their actions. JJBs, established in 2000, don't function in isolation but are the fulcrum of a network comprising child-friendly services including sensitised police units, legal aid services and rehabilitation centres. But research shows that all is not well with these pivotal panels. For one, getting information about them is difficult as there is no single government portal that tracks and publicly shares data related to them. Data shared in November by the India Justice Report (IJR) - a report created by civil society organisations to track the effectiveness of India's justice system - shows that as of 2023, more than half the cases before 362 JJBs were pending hearing. The report doesn't cover all of India's JJBs as it is based on answers from states that responded to a set of questions sent by IJR through the Right to Information Act. According to the report, India's 745 districts have 707 JJBs. The report also found that one in four JJBs lacked a full bench, even though the law mandates that every district should have at least one fully-staffed JJB. Maja Daruwala, editor at IJR, says that the dearth of accurate data indicates poor oversight and creates a lack of accountability, which in turn seriously impacts the quality of care and rehabilitation opportunities juveniles receive. Fr Antony Sebastian, founder of Echo, an NGO working for the welfare of juveniles, says that in the absence of JJBs, children lose not just the protection guaranteed to them by law, but also the chance to reform. "These children largely come from poor backgrounds and dysfunctional families, and they grow up witnessing violence and scarcity. When the police beat them and dump them in jails, they're revictimised all over again," says Fr Sebastian, a former principal magistrate on two separate JJBs in Bengaluru city. For minors not sent to jail, there isn't much scope for reformation in child care institutions (facilities that house children in conflict with the law), says Deeksha Gujral, programme director at iProbono, which offers legal aid to vulnerable people. JJBs can send children accused of crimes to observation homes, while those found to have committed an offence are placed in special homes. A separate facility, called a 'place of safety', houses children aged 16-18 years who are accused or found guilty of committing heinous offences. JJBs are mandated to inspect these facilities every month to ensure they meet the standards prescribed by law. However, many children's rights advocates say that regular checks seldom happen and even if they do, they're conducted in a superficial manner. Gujral, who has visited several observation and special homes in the course of her work, says that many of them are overcrowded, and lack counsellors or meaningful recreational, educational and vocational facilities. Additionally, while there are separate facilities for boys and girls, the mandated age-based segregation within these facilities is not always adhered to. "All the children do is eat, sleep and watch TV. In places like Delhi, where there already exists a strong gang and drug culture, these power dynamics are replicated within the residential facilities. Younger, less-experienced children look to older boys with connections to gangs outside the facility for protection," Gujral says, adding that incidents of violence and sexual abuse are also not uncommon. The BBC has sent a list of questions to the federal ministry of women and child development, which oversees the juvenile justice system, but has not received a response. Rizvi says that authorities in many facilities are also jaded. "They believe that these children are beyond help, and nothing they do will change them," she says, adding that she has seen this belief in many lawyers who represent children too. Fr Sebastian says that apathy takes root when there's a lack of understanding about the child's reality and the spirit of the law. He says that Echo, which runs a special home, has seen success stories where children found guilty of serious offences like murder and rape have been able to turn around their lives. He attributes this to the focus Echo places on running vocational training programmes like dairy and poultry farming, and hotel management, as well as offering regular counselling sessions. Darshan* was brought to Echo after he was found guilty of murdering his friend during a fight about a cricket match. Before that, he lived on the streets. "Counselling sessions at Echo helped Darshan confront what he had done, but also examine why he had done it," Fr Sebastian says. He was then enrolled in a behaviour modification programme while he completed his education through distance learning. Later, he trained in hotel management and is working with a well-known hotel. "Every child deserves a second chance," Fr Sebastian says. "As a society, we owe them at least that much." *Names have been changed as Indian law prohibits the disclosure of a juvenile offender's identity.

What message do Greenlanders have for Trump? The US Vice President JD Vance is hosting the Danish and Greenlandic foreign ministers, as well as their US counterpart, Marco Rubio in the White House on Wednesday. The focus of the talks: the future status of the world's biggest island, Greenland, a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark in the Arctic. Donald Trump says he wants it for national security and he'll take it "the easy way or the hard way". Supported by major European powers, including the UK and France, Denmark insists Greenland is its sovereign territory. Europe editor Katya Adler is in the Greenlandic capital Nuuk, where she hears from Greenlanders who have a message for Donald Trump.
