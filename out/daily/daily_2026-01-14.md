Uganda election chief says he has had threats over results declaration The head of Uganda's electoral body says he has received threats warning him against declaring certain presidential candidates the winners of Thursday's election. Simon Byabakama said he would not be intimidated by such threats from senior state officials, whom he did not name. He was responding to a BBC question about a widely shared video which shows a presidential assistant saying the electoral commission would never declare opposition candidate Robert Kyagulanyi, popularly known as Bobi Wine, as president, even if he were to win. "Some people say if you don't declare so-and-so as president, you will see. I tell them that I am not in the business of donating votes," said Byabakama. President Yoweri Museveni, 81, who has ruled the country for nearly four decades, is seeking a seventh term in office. Bobi Wine, a 43-year-old pop star turned politician, is Museveni's main challenger, seeking to unseat him for the second time after finishing runner-up in 2021 polls. Six other candidates are also in the race, in which about 21.6 million voters are registered to vote. Campaigning has been marked by the disruption of opposition activities, including the detention of activists and the breaking-up of rallies by police. At the Electoral Commission headquarters in the capital, Kampala, Byabakama said he was not worried about threats from what he called "idle people". "You can see from my demeanour that fear is a word that does not exist in my vocabulary," said the poll chief, adding that only the will of voters and the law would guide the process. In the video shared by the Daily Monitor newspaper on social media last week, Yiga Kisakyamukama, the special presidential assistant for service delivery and monitoring, was captured saying Museveni would never leave power through the ballot. "Don't expect, don't even think, that Simon Byabakama would announce Bobi Wine. President Museveni, who is on the chair, will remain on the chair. Never think that Museveni would leave power through voting. No, no, no - don't waste our time," Kisakyamukama was heard saying. But Byabakama said Uganda's law, not individual opinions or threats, would determine the outcome of the presidential election. "The law says that the candidate who receives more than 50% plus one of the total valid votes cast is the president of Uganda. It is the voters who determine how many votes a candidate gets. What the voters have said is what I will declare to the nation," he added. The poll chief said he would declare the results within 48 hours of the close of polling, in accordance with the country's laws. Responding to concerns about the heavy military presence in the streets, Byabakama said security forces were deployed to maintain peace and stability during the electoral process and should not intimidate voters. He also acknowledged opposition concerns about some polling stations being located within military premises, saying the commission was investigating the reports. "If we find that it is true, we shall take the necessary measures to address it," he added. On Tuesday, the authorities cut internet access and limited mobile services across the country in order to curb "misinformation, disinformation, electoral fraud and related risks". The network outage has heightened concerns about repression in the run-up to the vote. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

### 2. [Trump vows 'very strong action' if Iran executes protesters](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqj2qgw8w08o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

Trump vows 'very strong action' if Iran executes protesters President Donald Trump has said the US will take "very strong action" against Iran if it executes protesters, as rights groups say more than 2,400 anti-government demonstrators have been killed in a violent crackdown by Iranian authorities. Relatives of 26-year-old Erfan Soltani, who was detained last week, told BBC Persian he was due to be executed on Wednesday. It is unclear whether this has taken place. A representative from the Hengaw Organization for Human Rights also told the BBC that they had "never witnessed a case move so quickly". Speaking to the BBC's US partner CBS News, Trump said of potential executions: "If they hang them, you're going to see some things... We will take very strong action if they do such a thing." Soltani's relative told BBC Persian that an Iranian court had issued a death sentence "in an extremely rapid process, within just two days". They were "deeply concerned that he could be executed without any prior notice", given that contact with Iran has been affected by the internet shutdown. Soltani's detention demonstrated that the Iranian government was trying "to control the population, to not allow any more protests to happen", Hengaw representative Awyar Shekhi told the BBC's Radio 4 Today programme on Wednesday. Soltani's sister - who is a lawyer - tried to intervene in his case but was told by authorities there was nothing to pursue, Shekhi added. Prisoners sentenced to death in Iran are typically granted final moments with loved ones. While the Iranian authorities have told the family they will allow a meeting with Erfan before his execution, Shekhi said, he hasn't been allowed any contact with his family since his arrest. An Iranian official told Reuters that 2,000 people had been killed, but that "terrorists" were to blame. Trump earlier said he planned to attend a meeting at the White House on Tuesday night to discuss the situation in Iran, pledging to get "accurate numbers" on the death toll from the protests. "The killing looks like it's significant, but we don't know yet for certain," Trump told reporters while returning to the White House. Once he has the numbers, he said, "we'll act accordingly." The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) said that it had so far confirmed the killing of 2,403 protesters, as well as 12 children, despite an internet blackout. Nearly 150 people affiliated with the government have also been killed, the group said. State-linked Iranian news agency Fars reported that funerals were held in Tehran on Wednesday for more than 100 members of the security forces and others they described as "martyrs". On Tuesday, Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform that Iranian authorities would "pay a big price" for the killings, and urged people to "keep protesting". "I have cancelled all meetings with Iranian Officials until the senseless killing of protesters STOPS. HELP IS ON ITS WAY. MIGA!!!," he added, using the acronym for a US-based Iranian opposition slogan, "Make Iran Great Again". Trump has been weighing military and other options in response to the crackdown, having already announced 25% tariffs on any country trading with Iran. Iran's government has responded by accusing the US of seeking to "manufacture a pretext for military intervention", warning that "this playbook has failed before". The protests, which have reportedly spread to 180 cities and towns in all 31 provinces, were sparked by anger over the collapse of the Iranian currency and soaring cost of living. They quickly widened into demands for political change and became one of the most serious challenges to the clerical establishment since the 1979 Islamic revolution. Demonstrations escalated significantly last Thursday and were met with deadly force by authorities, masked by a near total shutdown of the internet and communication services. More than 18,434 protesters have been arrested during the unrest, according to HRANA. It is difficult to gauge the true scale of bloodshed because, like other international news organisations, the BBC is not able to report from inside the country. However, videos posted online on Sunday showed people searching for the bodies of their loved ones at the Kahrizak Forensic Centre in Tehran. The BBC counted at least 180 shrouded bodies and body bags in the footage. Around 50 bodies were visible in another video from the facility shared on Monday. "My friend went there [Kahrizak] to look for his brother, and he forgot his own sorrow," an activist told BBC Persian on Monday. "They piled up bodies from every neighbourhood, like Saadatabad, Naziabad, Sattarkhan. So you go to your address pile and search there. You don't know a fraction of the level of violence that's been used." Hospitals in the capital have also reportedly been overwhelmed by the number of casualties. Prof Shahram Kordasti, an Iranian oncologist based in London, told the BBC's Newsday programme on Tuesday that the last message he had received from a colleague in Tehran said: "In most hospitals, it's like a warzone. We are short of supplies, short of blood." Other doctors at "two to three hospitals" had also said they had treated hundreds of injured or dead people, he added. An Iranian living in Rasht, near the Caspian Sea coast, described the city as unrecognisable. "Everywhere is burnt with fire," they said. The UN human rights chief Volker Türk urged Iranian authorities to halt all forms of violence and repression against peaceful protesters immediately, his office said. He added that the labelling of protesters as "terrorists" to justify violence was unacceptable and that it was "extremely worrying" to see statements from Iranian officials indicating the possibility of the death penalty being used against protesters through expedited trials. Iran's Judiciary chief Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei said on Monday that those involved in the unrest would be "dealt with seriously and severely". And prosecutors have said some will be charged with "enmity against God", a national security offence that carries the death penalty. Türk also demanded that Iranian authorities restore full access to the internet and other communication services. Some international calls from Iran went through on Tuesday, but the internet shutdown has now passed 132 hours, according to monitor NetBlocks. One person living near Tehran with access via the Starlink satellite service told BBC Persian that there were "checkpoints in every block", where cars and the phones of their occupants were being inspected by security forces. New videos of protests in recent days have also emerged, with BBC Persian verifying those filmed in the central city of Arak and the western cities of Tabriz, Urmia and Khorramabad. In the footage from Khorramabad, gunfire can be heard during clashes between security forces and protesters, some of whom are throwing stones. The protesters chant slogans "Death to the dictator" - a reference to Ayatollah Khamenei - and "Reza Shah, may your soul rest in peace" - referring to the late monarch Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who was overthrown in the 1979 revolution and whose son Reza lives in exile.

At least 32 killed after crane collapses on train in Thailand At least 32 people have been killed and 66 others injured after a construction crane fell onto a moving train in north-eastern Thailand. The crane derailed the train and crushed some of its carriages, one of which caught fire. A one-year-old and an 85-year-old are among those injured, with seven people in critical condition, according to authorities. Officials say some 171 passengers had been onboard the train when the accident occurred at around 09:00 local time (02:00 GMT). The State Railway of Thailand has launched an investigation into the incident and announced that it is taking legal action against the construction company responsible for the crane. Italian-Thai Development Public Company Limited said it expressed regret and it would provide compensation and relief to the families of those who died or were injured. The train had been travelling from Bangkok to the north-eastern Ubon Ratchathani province when the accident occurred, carrying mostly students and workers travelling for school and work in other districts. Local outlet The Nation reported that the incident occurred while the crane was lifting a large concrete section which dropped on to the train, causing several coaches to derail. One survivor, train staff member Thirasak Wongsoongnern, told local media that he and the other passengers were thrown into the air after the crane fell on them. An eyewitness, Maliwan Nakthon, told BBC Thai that she witnessed the moment the crane collapsed. "There were small pieces, like fragments of concrete, that started falling," she said. "After those fell, the crane slowly slid down and hit. It struck hard, and then it came down and crushed the train." "The whole incident took less than one minute," she added. Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul, who is due to visit the scene later on Wednesday, called for "someone [to] be punished and held accountable" for the incident. "Accidents like this can only happen due to negligence, skipped steps, deviations from the design, or the use of incorrect materials," Anutin said. The crane was being used to build an overhead railway that is part of a US$5.4bn (£4bn) China-backed project to link Bangkok with neighbouring Laos, where a Chinese-built high-speed line is already running to south-western China. Known officially as the Bangkok-Nong Khai HSR Development for Regional Connectivity, the Italian-Thai Development Company is listed as the firm in charge of the Lam Takhong-Sikhio section where the incident took place. The State Railway of Thailand has announced that it is suing the company. The initial cost of damages for the train carriages alone are reported to be more than 100 million baht (US$31m). One of Thailand's biggest contractors, the company was responsible for the construction of a Bangkok skyscraper that collapsed last March during an earthquake. Last year the company's president and several designers and engineers were charged with professional negligence over that incident. Some have denied wrongdoing. The Chinese embassy in Thailand said that no Chinese construction companies or workers were involved in the collapse, Chinese state media reported. Thailand is no stranger to deadly construction accidents, due in part to weak enforcement of safety standards and regulations. In 2023, a freight train collided with a pick-up truck that was crossing railway tracks in the country's east, killing eight people and injuring four others. Around 150 people have been killed over the past seven years in numerous accidents on a road improvement project from Bangkok to the south of the country.

### 4. [China announces record $1tn trade surplus despite Trump tariffs](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9wx1v84rzyo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

China announces record $1tn trade surplus despite Trump tariffs China announced record export numbers for 2025, a year when US President Donald Trump's tariffs and trade policy caused turmoil in the global economy. Beijing on Wednesday reported the world's largest-ever trade surplus - the value of goods and services sold overseas compared to its imports - at $1.19tn (£890bn). It's the first time China's full-year trade surplus has passed $1tn, beating 2024's record figure of $993bn. China's monthly export surpluses passed $100bn seven times last year - a sign that Trump's tariff campaign have barely affected its overall trade with the rest of the world. Trade with the US did weaken, but this was made up for by a rise in Chinese exports elsewhere, especially to South East Asia, Africa and Latin America. Wang Jun, the deputy director of China's customs, said during a press conference on Wednesday that the figures are "extraordinary and hard-won" given the "profound changes" and challenges in global trade. He noted a rise in exports of green technology, artificial intelligence-related products and robotics. The huge surplus can be explained by strong overseas demand for Chinese goods as trade with global partners including South Asian countries and others in Africa and Europe grew, as well as a weak domestic market. China's economy has been weighed by a property crisis and rising debt, which has made businesses more hesitant to invest and consumers cautious about spending. As a result, there is less of a need to import goods, and imports rose by just 0.5%, according to the new figures. Meanwhile, a weaker yuan, a strong supply of goods and inflation in Western countries have also made Chinese exports more attractive. The results are a "mixed blessing" for Beijing, said trade policy analyst Deborah Elms from the Hinrich Foundation. China has benefited from sales and more jobs created from its business abroad, but its goods could face "greater scrutiny" from foreign markets that are under pressure to compete with its products, she said. China's success will likely continue in 2026 as Chinese goods and services become more deeply entrenched into global businesses, said Elms. These latest figures will be seen in Beijing as a sign that China has customers all around the world, besides the US, but Wang warned that China faces an uncertain external environment. Several countries have raised concerns that their markets are being flooded with low-priced Chinese products they cannot compete with. Businesses are also bracing for another year of turbulence and tariff tensions from the Trump administration. In April last year, Trump caused turmoil in the global economy by announcing sweeping tariffs on goods from more than 90 countries. Some of the most severe tariffs were reserved for China, which exports more to the US than any other country. An escalating war of words between the world's two largest economies saw threats of blanket triple-digit tariffs. At the time, trade experts saw this as a test of China's reliance on the US market, which Beijing insisted was just one of many places that Chinese businesses could sell to. Both sides managed to pause hostilities after a meeting between Trump and China's leader Xi Jinping in South Korea in October, avoiding a complete breakdown in trade relations. Other more moderate tariffs remain in place, which have severely dampened Chinese exports to the US.

### 5. [Amateur stuns world's best to win A$1m in Melbourne](https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/ckgyl1ndw57o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

Amateur player Jordan Smith would have been "happy winning just one point" - but walked away with A$1m (Â£496,835) and bragging rights over world number two Jannik Sinner as he triumphed at the Australian Open's Million Dollar One Point Slam. The innovative format offered amateur players the opportunity to win the prize money by playing a sole point against some of the sport's top talent and other famous faces. Smith was the star of the show on Rod Laver Arena, also defeating women's world number four Amanda Anisimova in front of almost 15,000 people. Smith faced women's world number 117 Joanna Garland in a fitting finale, after the Taiwanese 24-year-old stunned men's world number three Alexander Zverev and former Wimbledon finalist Nick Kyrgios. New South Wales state champion Smith was not the only amateur to seize his moment in the spotlight, with Queensland state champion Alec Reverente beating men's world number seven Felix Auger-Aliassime. As the two best performing amateurs, Smith and Reverente also went head-to-head to win a brand new car, with Reverente triumphing. The tournament was played in good spirits - even a racquet smash by Kyrgios following his defeat was performed in good humour - and generated genuine intrigue. Many of the beaten players, including men's number one Carlos Alcaraz, remained at Rod Laver Arena and gathered around televisions to watch the conclusion between the two unlikely finalists. Upsets, shocks and entertainment at Melbourne Park The opening match set the tone for the evening when tennis coach Andres Schneiter knocked out men's world number 34 Corentin Moutet. The upsets kept on coming across the quick-fire format as fellow players offered enthusiastic support from the side of the court and the crowd rallied behind the underdogs. British-born Garland, who was beaten in the first round of singles qualifying in Melbourne, appeared more stunned than anyone as she beat former women's world number three Maria Sakkari and 2024 Wimbledon semi-finalist Donna Vekic. Smith, meanwhile, did not need to hit a ball against Sinner after the men's world number two failed to land his serve - with professionals only granted one opportunity to get it right. He was not done there, following up victory over Anisimova by beating 71st-ranked Spaniard Pedro Martinez to set up his shot at the prize money. "Coming into tonight I would have been happy winning just one point," said the 29-year-old Smith, who won national titles as a junior. "I was so nervous but enjoyed being out here, it was a great experience." Elsewhere, Sakkari ended Alcaraz's bid after the top-ranked men's player netted an attempted drop shot. Meanwhile six-time major winner Iga Swiatek saw off the men's world number 22 and 31 in Flavio Cobolli and Frances Tiafoe respectively before losing to Martinez. How did the Million Dollar One Point Slam work? The event, held four days before the Australian Open starts on Sunday, featured a total of 48 competitors, including 24 top professionals. Eight amateur winners of state championship rounds, eight players who qualified in Melbourne, and another eight wildcards - including celebrities and invited personalities - made up the rest of the competition. Beginning with a game of 'rock, paper, scissors' to decide who serves, each match consisted of a single point, with the winner progressing in a knockout format. The Australian Open held its inaugural One Point Slam event in 2025, but the prize fund was A$60,000 (Â£29,808) and Russia's Andrey Rublev was the only top-10 player involved. It is the latest attempt by tennis authorities to attract new interest in the sport after the US Open introduced a standalone mixed doubles championship before the main draw last year. 'Roaring success for both underdog and tournament' Analysis by BBC Sport tennis news reporter Jonathan Jurejko At the start of the night, Coco Gauff admitted she didn't want to win the One Point Slam. Instead, the two-time major singles champion wanted an amateur to take home the money. They would be more deserving of a sum which would change their life, she reasoned. Smith, a reserved character who was genuinely lost for words as he was interviewed on court after each win, ended up being the beneficiary. A different future awaits. One as a new homeowner at the very least. Remarkably, it was Smith who possessed the calmest demeanour in the place. He was unruffled by standing across the net from Sinner. He was unflustered by the sight of a box-full of replica cash sitting courtside. He was unperturbed as he traded with Garland from the baseline knowing the vast sum at stake. The innovative event turned out to be masterstroke by Australian Open tournament director Craig Tiley. Superstar players brought gravitas and the possibility of anybody beating anybody added some jeopardy. A virtually full arena boosted income and the event proved popular with fans online. Tiley insisted the boom-or-bust concept was a leveller between Grand Slams and grassroots. The unknown underdog ensured it was the roaring success which both dreamed of.

LA to open ticket draw for 2028 Olympics - with seats starting at $28 Sport fans will be able to sign up from Wednesday for a chance to attend the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic Games - with tickets starting at $28 (£20.80). Registration opens at 07:00 local time (15:00 GMT) for fans to enter a random ticket draw covering all events that will take place at the Games. The window will remain open until mid-March. If chosen, fans will be notified via email and will be given a time slot to purchase tickets in April. One million of those tickets will sell for $28, and about one-third are set to cost less than $100 (£74.41). "These Games belong to everyone," Casey Wasserman, the chairman of LA 2028 said on Tuesday. "These Games have to be affordable and inclusive." The announcement of affordable ticket prices come after the price of tickets for the 2026 men's football World Cup - which will also be hosted in the US, as well as Canada and Mexico - received some public criticism. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, LA officials said affordability and accessibility were central to their ticketing plan - and their hope that sport fans around the globe would be able to attend. Tickets for the 2024 Olympics in Paris started at $27.95 (£20). A special early purchase window will also be open for residents in the Los Angeles area and Oklahoma City, where some Olympic Games are also being held. 2028 will be the first time the Olympics will be held in the US since the 1996 Games in Atlanta. Los Angeles has twice hosted the Olympics - in 1932 and 1984 - and plans to use its already established infrastructure to host the Games. Event organisers, along with hundreds of Olympians and Paralympians, gathered at the LA Memorial Coliseum on Tuesday for a ceremonial lighting of the Olympic venue's cauldron ahead of the opening of ticket registration. The Coliseum hosted events on both the previous occasions that the Olympics were held in LA, and it is set to co-host the opening ceremony along with track and field events in 2028. Organisers at the event on Tuesday explained how the ticketing would work. Once registered - using their name, email and zip code - fans will be entered into the random draw for time slots to buy tickets in April. The earlier slot a fan is given, the better their chances at securing tickets - as being given a time slot does not guarantee that there will be tickets available once a time slot is open. The first set of tickets will be up for purchase from 9-19 April. Admission for the opening and closing ceremonies of the Games will be among the tickets on offer. Most of the Games will be held across Los Angeles and southern California, but both canoeing and softball will be held in Oklahoma. LA28 chief Allison Katz-Mayfield called the random ticket-drawing process "the fairest way to ensure that the broadest number of people can get access to tickets and that no one is advantaged or disadvantaged". "No matter when you go in, whether you're the first person in or the last person in, you have the same opportunity," she added. Registration for tickets will be open until 18 March, and there is no advantage to registering early.

Russian doctors arrested after 9 babies die in maternity hospital Two senior doctors have been arrested in Russia following the deaths of nine babies in a maternity hospital in Siberia this month. The newborns died during the long New Year holiday in Novokuznetsk, Russia's main investigative authority said in a statement. No reason for the babies' deaths has been given. The case has caused anger around Russia. All the babies were born in the Novokuznetsk Maternity Hospital No.1 from 1-12 January, with the first death on 4 January, Russia's Investigative Committee spokeswoman Svetlana Petrenko said. Without giving details, the committee said the chief physician and the head of the intensive care unit had been detained for the "improper performance of their official and professional duties in organising and providing medical care". It said the suspects were co-operating with the investigation and authorities were deciding on charges as well as pre-trial detention. The committee released a video showing one man being escorted away and a man signing some papers in the presence of a uniformed officer. Victims and witnesses had been questioned and materials seized as work continued to gather more evidence, it added. Nine post-mortem examinations were being carried out. The Interfax news agency said the Kemerovo Region Ministry of Health which was also investigating said the infants had had a severe intra-uterine infection. The hospital has announced that it is no longer accepting patients due to a higher-than-usual rate of respiratory infections.

K-pop drum duet between Japan and South Korea's leaders caps off summit talks A surreal drum duet between two East Asian world leaders has set the internet abuzz - and put a spotlight on Japan and South Korea's diplomatic relationship. Decked out in matching blue jackets, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung and Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi on Tuesday played drums to the beats of K-pop hits - including Dynamite by BTS and Golden from hit film KPop Demon Hunters. The performance, a nod to Takaichi's past life as a drummer in a heavy metal band, wrapped up Lee's official visit to Japan this week. It's also part of Lee's diplomatic overtures to regional powers including Japan, with whom South Korea has a fraught history but shares a security alliance. The drumming session from Tuesday, which Lee described as "a little clumsy", has now spawned a viral video. During Lee's visit to Nara, Takaichi's hometown, he gifted the Japanese prime minister a drum set. The two leaders also exchanged signed drumsticks after their performance. "When we met at APEC last year, [Lee] said it was his dream to play the drums, so we prepared a surprise," Takaichi later wrote on X. Footage of the jam session has won praise on social media. "Music seems to have the power to connect hearts at a deeper level than words ever could," one X user wrote in Korean. "Exchanges like this may be quiet, but they will surely help move relations between Korea and Japan forward." There have long been sore spots between the two neighbours, including historical grievances from Japan's colonial rule and territorial disputes. But both countries are allies of the US, and have worked together to counter China's increasing assertiveness in the region. On Tuesday, Takaichi said in a statement that cooperation between Japan, South Korea and the US has become increasingly important amid heightened tensions in the region's "strategic environment". Lee and Takaichi have also agreed to boost economic cooperation - a pledge that comes as China has been tightening its export of rare earths and dual-use goods to Japan. "Just seeing them actually playing drums together - not just posing - looks like they are having so much fun, and that's what matters most," an X user wrote in Japanese. "Both Korea and Japan are facing tough situations, but if we can meet each other halfway, I truly believe things will move in a positive direction." Lee's smoothness as a diplomat has boosted his approval ratings back home. Days before his viral jam session with Takaichi, he met Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing, with whom he took selfies on a Chinese smartphone. Last October, he flattered US President Donald Trump with a large golden crown. The only leader he hasn't been able to charm is North Korea's Kim Jong Un. Pyongyang has rejected Lee's overtures for peace and shown little interest in reconciliation. This week, Pyongyang demanded an apology from Seoul after accusing it of flying surveillance drones in its territory. Lee's rise to become president of South Korea had previously sounded alarm bells in Tokyo and Washington. Relatively unknown outside his own country at the time, Lee had a reputation as a firebrand who was sympathetic to socialist economic causes. The US feared South Korea would tilt towards China, South Korea's largest trading partner. Japan, meanwhile, feared a repeat of a spat in 2019, when South Korea threatened to pull out of an intelligence-sharing agreement after Japan tightened its exports to the country. That fight broke out after a South Korean court ordered Japanese companies to compensate the survivors of Japan's wartime forced labour, an issue Japan now considers resolved. Since taking office, however, Lee has walked a diplomatic tightrope among the region's major powers, from the US to China and now Japan. Lee heaped praise on Takaichi's drumming skills in a post on X, and likened their diplomatic efforts to the musical duet. "Even if our timing was slightly different, our intention to find the same rhythm was shared," he wrote. "In that same spirit, we will continue to build a future-oriented Korea–Japan relationship together, with one heart."

Claudette Colvin, US civil rights pioneer, dies at 86 Claudette Colvin, who helped end racial segregation in the US by refusing to give up her bus seat to a white person, has died. She was 86 years old. Colvin's protest, which led to her arrest, came in 1955 at the age of 15 while she was living in Montgomery, Alabama. It happened nine months before the arrest of Rosa Parks, who also famously refused to give her bus seat to a white person, in a move that led to widespread boycotting of public transportation in the city, and a Supreme Court decision that outlawed such racial discrimination. Colvin's arrest was largely unknown until 2009, when the first detailed book about her experience was published. "She leaves behind a legacy of courage that helped change the course of American history," said a statement from the Claudette Colvin Legacy Foundation, which announced her death. One year after her arrest, the US Supreme Court ruled that segregation on buses must end. The legal case turned on the testimony of four plaintiffs, one of whom was Colvin. In an interview with the BBC in 2018, Ms Colvin recalled that she "was not frightened, but disappointed and angry" because she knew she "was sitting in the right seat". She was the first person to be arrested for challenging Montgomery's bus segregation policies, but her story remained relatively unknown for decades. It was Rosa Parks who became one of the main figures of the civil rights movement after her very similar case led to the large-scale boycott of the bus system in the city. Colvin said she had been inspired by the great anti-slavery campaigners Harriet Tubman and Sojourner Truth. "Whenever people ask me: 'Why didn't you get up when the bus driver asked you?' I say it felt as though Harriet Tubman's hands were pushing me down on one shoulder and Sojourner Truth's hands were pushing me down on the other shoulder," she told the BBC. Later in life, she became a nurse in New York. According to her organisation, she died in Texas.

No power or water and -19C: Kyiv seeks relief from Russian strikes and cold At a suburban Kyiv railway station, two carriages painted in the blue and white livery of Ukrainian Railways sit on the main platform, their diesel engines running as snow steadily falls. The train is not going anywhere but it is providing a vital service for dozens of people who have been left without power and basics like running water or heating. These are Ukraine's "Invincibility Trains", designed to boost public morale and provide some comfort as a bitter winter coincides with intensifying Russian attacks. In one of the carriages, Alina sits watching her infant son Taras playing with toys provided by international charities who help run the service. "It's winter and it's rather cold outside," says Alina which is something of an understatement. With the effect of the wind-chill, temperatures this week in Kyiv have hit -19C. It is bitterly cold. "I live in a new building on the 17th floor, but we have no elevator, no electricity and no water supply," says Alina. As Taras plays with his toys, she says it is also a relatively safe and comfortable place for her daughter to meet friends. It is also a welcome distraction for Alina, whose husband works all day in a factory, but she suddenly starts to stutter and weep as she tells me about her 54-year-old father who was killed at the front two years ago in a summer offensive near Bakhmut. As she regathers her composure, Alina says she will definitely come back here and welcomes the relief the train brings from the weather and the nightly Russian strikes. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia of deliberately exploiting the bitter winter to target power stations, energy storage facilities and other critical infrastructure. Kyiv's Mayor, Vitali Klitschko, somewhat controversially this week also suggested that city residents, who could, should leave Kyiv to help ease pressure on critical resources. It was a comment seized upon by Russia as a sign of resignation and defeatism. But despite such obvious hardships, most people here in Kyiv remain stoic and are prepared to put up with them. For Yulia Mykhailiuk, Ihor Honcharuk and their one-year-old son Markiian, that means heating building bricks on a gas stove to try to warm up the rest of their small apartment. The flat, in an old Soviet-era apartment block on the east side of the Dnipro river, is a temporary move because their own home was partially damaged in a Russian attack last August. "We've had electricity today for something like four minutes," Ihor tells me. "All of our charging stations and power banks have no energy left in them." "For the first time in a while we have a real winter in Ukraine," says Yulia somewhat ironically. "With this -12 to -16 cold and no heating, the apartment gets cold pretty soon." The large batteries the couple have bought, like many city residents, to charge up when electricity does return are of no use when it comes to heating appliances because they run down so quickly. For now, dressing the baby up in multiple layers of clothing is the only solution, but Yulia says at the weekend they will heed Mayor Klitschko's call and temporarily move away from Kyiv to her parents' home outside the city, although she says it's a decision they have made for themselves and not because of pressure from the mayor's office. The energy crisis is not the only reason to move. Just across the courtyard from their new, temporary home, a recent Russian drone strike hit an apartment block, badly damaging several homes. Kyiv's problems are exacerbated by the fact it has borne so many Russian airstrikes against homes and critical infrastructure installations and, as home to more than three million people, the power shortages impact many people. The most recent Russian attacks against energy installations in the capital and other big cities have had a cumulative effect that is much worse than before. Klitschko said strikes on Monday night had caused the worst electrical outage the city had yet seen, and on Tuesday more than 500 residential buildings were still without power. "Compared to all previous winters, the situation now is the worst," Olena Pavlenko, president of the Kyiv-based think tank DiXi Group, told the Kyiv Independent website. "Every time it's harder to recover. Everything is under ice, and repairs of cables and grids are now two to four times more complicated," she said. Around the clock and across the city, engineers from private energy companies and the municipal authority are repairing power plants hit directly in Russian strikes or installations indirectly affected by them. On another bitterly cold morning we found hardy engineers using mechanical diggers and working with their bare hands to locate and repair damaged power cables which serve the huge multi-occupancy tower blocks on the river's east bank. The city authorities have repeatedly asked people and business not to use high-energy consumption devices because they use so much power, and when the electricity supply returns, the surge in demand for power causes the system to collapse – hence the damaged power cables we saw being repaired. But the engineer in charge here acknowledged it was a temporary fix. "It will take years and years. We are currently working literally in emergency modes," says Andrii Sobko from DTEK Grids repair crew. "The equipment is literally operating at its critical parameters so that at least the residents have light." As the war drags on, it's hard to find anyone in Ukraine who has not been directly impacted by the conflict. Stanislav or "Stas" has also come down to the Invincibility Train to get warm, meet friends and get some power for his phone. The eleven-year-old says his home is very cold and there'd recently been no power in the family's apartment for 36 hours. He recalls with clarity the opening day of the war almost four years ago when he could see bright flashes in the sky - a "bright orb" - as Russia launched its attacks. These days it is the threat of Russian drones that keeps him awake at night. "When I hear something flying it's really scary, because you don't know if it will explode now, or if it will fly on and you survive." As we perch on the top bunk of the carriage where he is sitting with another friend, Stas is frank about the impact of the war on his generation. "I forget the times when there was no war, I don't remember those moments – life is difficult," says Stas, his smile wide and demeanour remarkably bubbly. There are all kinds of people seeking warmth, comfort or company on the train. But my next conversation with an elderly lady, who says her discomfort is nothing compared with what soldiers on the front are enduring, is abruptly cut short as the familiar high-pitched sound of an air raid alert rings out on our phones. The conductor orders everyone off the train and directs them to a shelter, about a kilometre away. Most head home instead, to the cold and their interrupted power supplies but all - including Stas and Alina - say they'll be back tomorrow. Everyone in Kyiv is putting a brave face on things. This extraordinarily cold winter, even by Ukrainian standards, will not last for much more than a couple of months and the energy crisis will ease. What most people fear is that, despite some optimism at the end of last year, there is no end in sight to the war itself and the inevitable loss of life.
