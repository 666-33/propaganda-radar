Japan court orders compensation for migrants lured to North Korea A Tokyo court has asked Pyongyang to pay 88 million Japanese yen ($570,000; £416,000) to four people who were lured to North Korea decades ago by a propaganda scheme. The plaintiffs said the North was marketed to them as "paradise on Earth", but they instead found themselves subject to harsh conditions, including forced labour. They later escaped. Monday's ruling is largely symbolic with no real way to enforce it: North Korea has for years ignored the lawsuit, and its leader Kim Jong Un has not responded to Japanese court summons. But the ruling, which comes after a years-long legal battle in Japanese courts, has been hailed by the plaintiffs' lawyer as "historic". This was the first time "a Japanese court exercised its sovereignty against North Korea to recognise its malpractice", said Atsushi Shiraki, a lawyer representing the plaintiffs, AFP reported. More than 90,000 Zainichi Koreans - ethnic Koreans who live in Japan - moved to North Korea between 1959 and 1984, under a resettlement scheme which promised an idyllic life of free healthcare, education and jobs. But instead survivors say they found themselves forced to work on farms and factories, subject to restrictions and could not leave. One of the plaintiffs, Eiko Kawasaki, went to North Korea in 1960, when she was 17. She escaped in 2003 and is now 83 years old. She was among a group of five plaintiffs who filed a lawsuit in 2018 demanding compensation. Two of the original plaintiffs have since died, but one of them continued to be represented in the lawsuit by their family. In 2022, a Tokyo district court rejected their compensation claims, saying that it fell outside Japanese jurisdiction and the statute of limitations had expired. But in 2023, the Tokyo High Court ruled that the case was in fact under Japanese jurisdiction and found that North Korea had violated the plaintiffs' rights. "It's not an overstatement to say most of their lives were ruined by North Korea," judge Taiichi Kamino said at a ruling at the Tokyo District Court on Monday, according to an Associated Press report. Kenji Fukuda, another lawyer for the plaintiffs acknowledged the significance of the ruling but said it would be a "challenge" actually getting any money from North Korea.

**Excerpt**

India and EU announce landmark trade deal The European Union and India have announced a landmark trade deal after nearly two decades of on-off talks, as both sides aim to deepen ties amid tensions with the US. "We have concluded the mother of all deals," European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen posted on X after meeting Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi. He called the deal "historic". It will allow free trade of goods between the bloc of 27 European states and the world's most populous country, which together make up nearly 25% of global gross domestic product and a market of two billion people. The pact is expected to significantly reduce tariffs and expand market access for both sides. Von der Leyen and European Council President António Costa are in Delhi, where they met Modi at a bilateral summit. The European Commission said the agreement would eliminate tariffs on most exports of chemicals, machinery and electrical equipment, as well as aircraft and spacecraft, following phased reductions. Significantly, duties on motor vehicles, currently as high as 110%, would be cut to 10% under a quota of 250,000 vehicles. The deal is set to lower costs for European products entering India - such as cars, machinery and agricultural food items, after import duties are reduced. Sensitive agricultural sectors, including dairy and sugar, have been excluded. Brussels said the agreement would support investment flows, improve access to European markets and deepen supply-chain integration. "This is a historic agreement," Modi said. "It will make access to European markets easier for India's farmers and small business. It will also boost manufacturing and services sectors. It will boost innovative partnerships." The deal comes as both India and the EU contend with economic and geopolitical pressure from the US. Delhi is grappling with 50% tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump last year amid talks aimed at securing a trade deal between India and the US that are still dragging on. Last week, Trump threatened to escalate his trade war with European allies for opposing a US takeover of Greenland before backing off. That larger geopolitical context was evident in recent statements made by leaders. On Tuesday, von der Leyen wrote: "We have created a free trade zone of two billion people, with both sides set to benefit. This is only the beginning. We will grow our strategic relationship to be even stronger." A day before that Costa had said, without naming the US, that the trade deal would send an "important political message to the world that India and the EU believe more in trade agreements than in tariffs" at a time when protectionism is on the rise and "some countries have decided to increase tariffs". Von der Leyen and Costa arrived in Delhi over the weekend and were the chief guests at India's colourful Republic Day celebrations on Monday. On Tuesday, the leaders posed for photos with Modi, with the bonhomie between them evident. The formal signing is likely to take place only later this year, after the agreement is approved by the European Parliament and the European Council. Alongside the trade agreement, India and the European Union are also advancing separate talks on security and defence co-operation, and climate action. On Tuesday, India's Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said he had discussed a range of bilateral security and defence issues with the European Commission's vice-president Kaja Kallas, including opportunities to integrate supply chains to build trusted defence ecosystems and develop future-ready capabilities. Reuters news agency reported that the two sides are working on a draft security and defence partnership covering areas such as maritime security, cyber threats and defence dialogue. "This is a perfect example of a partnership between two major economies of the world... This agreement represents 25% of the global GDP and one-third of global trade," Modi said while inaugurating the India Energy Week conference on Tuesday. The EU is India's largest trading partner in goods, with bilateral merchandise trade reaching $136bn (£99.4bn) in 2024-25, nearly doubling over a decade. Talks for a deal between India and the EU started in 2007 but stalled in 2013 over roadblocks in market access and regulatory demands. Discussions were formally restarted in July 2022. The main sticking points were access to India's automobile market, agriculture goods and carbon-linked tariffs - and analysts will be reading the fine print to see what the final agreement says on these issues. Officials from both sides worked hard over the past few days to finalise outstanding chapters of the agreement, aiming to wrap it up before the EU leaders' visit. The agreement comes as pressure grows on Delhi and Brussels to secure alternative markets for exporters. In the past seven months, India signed major trade agreements with the UK, Oman and New Zealand, and a 2024 pact signed with the four-nation European Free Trade Association bloc of Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein has come into effect. The EU, meanwhile, signed a trade deal with South American trade bloc Mercosur earlier this month after 25 years of negotiation.

**Excerpt**

Philippines' Duterte fit to face ICC proceedings, judges say Judges at the International Criminal Court (ICC) have ruled that former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte is fit to attend pre-trial proceedings for alleged crimes against humanity. The ICC also will hold a hearing on 23 February to decide whether the prosecution's case against Duterte is strong enough to proceed to a trial. Duterte's lawyers earlier argued that the 80-year-old was unfit to participate in the ICC proceedings citing "cognitive impairment". He has been detained at the Hague since March 2025. He is accused of being responsible for dozens of murders under his so-called war on drugs, during which thousands of small-time drug dealers, users and others were killed without trial. Duterte was president of the Philippines from 2016 to 2022. He justified his war on drugs by saying peace and order would pave the way for economic development. Citing opinions from a panel of medical experts, ICC judges said they were "satisfied" that Duterte is "able effectively to exercise his procedural rights and is therefore fit to take part in the pre-trial proceedings". ICC judges also said in their decision on Monday that the mental capacities needed to "meaningfully exercise one's procedural and fair trial rights" did not have to be "at their notionally highest level". "This ruling tells victims that in the reckoning of Duterte at the ICC, their voices will not be sidelined by technical evasions," said Congresswoman Leila de Lima, one of Duterte's fiercest critics who was jailed during his presidency on drug charges that were later found to be false. Duterte was arrested at Manila airport in March 2025 as his family's alliance with his successor, President Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos Jr crumbled. His arrest has divided Filipinos. While his deadly drugs crackdown has drawn sharp criticism from civil society, his populist message resonates with those who feel sidelined by Manila's political elite. In May last year, Duterte was elected mayor of Davao city despite being in prison. His daughter, Vice-President Sara Duterte, is also widely expected to run for president in the 2028 elections, where Marcos is ineligible to seek a second term.

**Excerpt**

Firefighters battle 'emergency level' blazes in Australia heatwave Firefighters in the Australian state of Victoria are battling at least six major fires as a record-breaking heatwave hits the country's south-east. Two fires are currently burning at "emergency level" according to local broadcaster ABC News. Several communities have been issued emergency warnings to either evacuate, watch and wait, or shelter in place. Fire officials warn that the situation is changing rapidly and have asked locals to stay up to date with the latest warnings. The Bureau of Meteorology says that parts of the state have seen all-time temperature highs - with one area hitting a high of 48.9C. Melbourne has recorded a temperature of 41C. Chris Hardman, the chief fire officer at Forest Fire Management Victoria, had told reporters that the state's heat conditions were making conditions "incredibly difficult" for firefighters. Two fires - in Camperdown and Otways - are burning at emergency level. A new fire in the Larralea area is also causing "significant concern". Country Fire Authority (CFA) chief officer Jason Hefferman told ABC Radio that there was a danger that the Otways fire could produce ember showers "which can create more fires in front of the main fire". It is unclear what damage has been caused by the fires, but Australia's Deputy Incident Controller Alistair Drayton, said he had "anecdotal evidence" that some homes had been lost. He also praised the "spectacular" work done by firefighters so far. Apart from Victoria, where there is a total fire ban, South Australia has also been placed under alert for "extreme" fire risk. Meanhwile health officials have warned that the prolonged heat carries significant health risks. The elderly, children and people with underlying health conditions are most at risk, Victoria chief health officer Caroline McElnay told reporters. "It can cause potentially fatal health problems such as heat exhaustion and heat stroke but it can also trigger events like heart attacks or stroke."

Nipah virus outbreak in India triggers Asia airport screenings An outbreak of the deadly Nipah virus in India's West Bengal state has sparked concern in parts of Asia, with some tightening screening measures at airports. Thailand has started screening passengers at three airports that receive flights from West Bengal. Nepal has also begun screening arrivals at Kathmandu airport and other land border points with India. Five healthcare workers in West Bengal were infected by the virus early this month, one of whom is in a critical condition. Some 110 people who were in contact with them have been quarantined. The virus can spread from animals to humans. It has a high death range – ranging from 40% to 75% – as there is no vaccine or medicine to treat it. What is the Nipah virus and what are its symptoms? The Nipah virus can be transmitted from animals, like pigs and fruit bats, to humans. It can also spread person-to-person through contaminated food. The World Health Organization has described Nipah in its top ten priority diseases, along with pathogens like Covid-19 and Zika, because of its potential to trigger an epidemic. The incubation period ranges from four to 14 days. People who contract the virus show a wide range of symptoms, or sometimes, none at all. Initial symptoms may include fever, headaches, muscle pain, vomiting and sore throat. In some people, these may be followed by drowsiness, altered consciousness, and pneumonia. Encephalitis, a sometimes-fatal condition that causes inflammation of the brain, may occur in severe cases. To date, no drugs of vaccines have been approved to treat the disease. Where were the past outbreaks? The first recognised Nipah outbreak was in 1998 among pig farmers in Malaysia and later spread to neighbouring Singapore. The virus got its name from the village where it was first discovered. More than 100 people were killed and a million pigs culled in an effort to contain the virus. It also resulted in significant economic losses for farmers and those in the livestock trade. Bangladesh has borne the brunt in recent years, with more than 100 people dying of Nipah since 2001. The virus has also been detected in India. Outbreaks were reported in West Bengal in 2001 and 2007. More recently, the southern state of Kerala has been a Nipah hotspot. In 2018, 19 cases were reported of which 17 were fatal; and in 2023, two out of six confirmed cases later died. What is happening now? At least five confirmed cases were reported as of last week, all of whom were linked to a private hospital in Barasat. Two nurses are being treated in an intensive coronary care unit, one of whom remains in "very critical" condition, local media reported citing the state's health department. No cases have yet been reported outside India, but several countries are stepping up precautions. On Sunday, Thailand started screening passengers at three international airports in Bangkok and Phuket that receive flights from West Bengal. Passengers from these flights have been asked to make health declarations. The parks and wildlife department has also implemented stricter screenings in natural tourist attractions. Jurai Wongswasdi, a spokeswoman for the Department for Disease Control, told BBC Thai authorities are "fairly confident" about guarding against an outbreak in Thailand. Nepal, too, has begun screening people arriving through the airport in Kathmandu and other land border points with India. Meanwhile, health authorities in Taiwan have proposed to list the Nipah virus as a "Category 5 disease". Under the island's system, diseases classified as Category 5 are emerging or rare infections with major public health risks, that require immediate reporting and special control measures.

**Excerpt**

Trump raises US tariffs on South Korea imports to 25% US President Donald Trump has announced he is raising tariffs on South Korean imports to 25% after accusing Seoul of "not living up" to a trade deal reached last year. In a post on social media, Trump said he would increase levies on South Korea from 15% across a range of products including automobiles, lumber, pharmaceuticals and "all other Reciprocal TARIFFS". Trump said South Korean lawmakers have been slow to approve the deal while "we have acted swiftly to reduce our TARIFFS in line with the Transaction agreed to". South Korea says it had not been given official notice of the decision to raise tariffs on some of its goods, and wanted urgent talks with Washington over the issue. It added that South Korea's Industry Minister Kim Jung-kwan, who is currently in Canada, will visit Washington as soon as possible to meet US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. South Korea's benchmark Kospi stock index fell on Tuesday morning but was trading about 1.8% higher later in the day as shares in major exporters recovered. Seoul and Washington reached a deal last October, which included a pledge from South Korea to invest $350bn (£256bn) in the US, some of which would go to shipbuilding. The following month, the two countries agreed that the US would reduce tariffs on some products once South Korea started the process to approve the deal. The agreement was submitted to South Korea's National Assembly on 26 November and is currently being reviewed. It is likely to be passed in February, according to local media. Tariffs are paid by companies who import products. In this case, US firms will pay a 25% tax on goods they buy from South Korea. Trump has frequently used tariffs as leverage to enact foreign policy during his second term in the White House. On Saturday, he threatened Canada with a 100% tariff if it struck a trade deal with China. On Monday, Chinese officials said its "strategic partnership" agreement with Canada is not meant to undercut other countries. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has said his country was not pursuing a free trade deal with China and has "never" considered it. He added that Canadian officials have made their position clear to their American counterparts. Before that, Trump said he would impose import taxes on eight countries - including the UK - who opposed US plans to seize Greenland, an autonomous territory in the Kingdom of Denmark which is a member of Nato. He later backed down from the tariff threat over Greenland citing progress towards a "future deal" over the island, but the episode strained US relations with Denmark and other Nato allies.

New Iran videos show bodies piled in hospital and snipers on roofs Verified videos emerging from Iran show bodies piled up in a hospital, snipers stationed on buildings and CCTV cameras being destroyed, following the unprecedented crackdown on protests earlier this month. BBC Verify has been tracking the spread of protests across Iran since they first erupted in late December, but the near total internet blackout imposed by the authorities has made it extremely difficult to document the scale of the state's deadly crackdown on protesters. The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) says it has confirmed the killing of nearly 6,000 people, including 5,633 protesters, since the unrest began at the end of December. It says it is also currently investigating another 17,000 reported deaths received despite an internet shutdown after nearly three weeks. Another group, the Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR), has warned that the final toll could exceed 25,000. Iranian authorities said last week that more than 3,100 people were killed, but that the majority were security personnel or bystanders attacked by "rioters". The latest videos to emerge from the country are understood to have been filmed on 8 and 9 January, when thousands of people took to the streets following a call for nationwide protests from Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the late Shah. They are thought to be the deadliest nights for protesters so far and these newly verified videos show how Iran's security forces have been violently cracking down on protesters. Multiple clips analysed by BBC Verify and BBC Persian show bodies piled up inside a mortuary at Tehranpars hospital in east Tehran. We verified the location of the hospital by matching its interior to other publicly available images and videos of the building, and counted at least 31 bodies in just one video. Another clip shows seven body bags laid on the ground outside the hospital's entrance. Hundreds of people are seen protesting on a highway in west Tehran in another video before multiple rounds of gunfire can be heard and people begin to scream. Protesters have also been seen trying to evade Iran's heavy surveillance infrastructure by disabling CCTV cameras. Footage we verified shows one person in the capital climbing up a post and hitting a surveillance camera several times in an attempt to disable it. A huge crowd of protesters can be seen on the ground and heard cheering as the camera is damaged. We have tracked the spread of the anti-government protests across 71 towns and cities in Iran, though the true number of areas where demonstrations have taken place is likely far higher. In the south-eastern city of Kerman a video taken from high up in a building shows several armed men in military uniform walking down a road firing their weapons continuously, though it is not clear who they are shooting at. A small fire burns in the middle of the road while the sound of protesters chanting can be heard in the background. Snipers have also been recorded on the roofs of buildings. In the north-eastern city of Mashhad verified video shows two men dressed in black on a rooftop of a building in daylight. One man is standing next to a large rifle that is lent against a wall and speaking on the phone. The other man crouches on the floor while smoking. For most people there has been an almost-total internet blackout since 8 January, but some have managed to briefly access the internet using methods such as SpaceX's Starlink satellite internet and virtual private networks (VPNs). More videos are likely to emerge in the coming days as the country's economy has struggled during the blackout. Additional reporting BBC Persian.

**Excerpt**

Sly Dunbar, prolific legend of reggae, dies aged 73 Reggae legend Sly Dunbar, who played with everyone from Bob Marley to The Rolling Stones, has died at the age of 73. One of the genre's most revered drummers, he played on tracks such as Bob Marley's Punky Reggae Party and Dave and Ansell Collins' classic, Double Barrel. However, he was better known as half of the production team Sly & Robbie - who produced groundbreaking hits for everyone from Peter Tosh and Black Uhuru, to non-reggae acts like Bob Dylan, Grace Jones and Ian Dury. Dunbar's death was first reported by his wife, Thelma, who told the Jamaican newspaper The Gleaner she had found him unresponsive on Monday morning. The musician's agent and publicist confirmed the news to the BBC. Born Lowell Fillmore Dunbar in Kingston, Jamaica, he started out playing on tin cans, after watching Lloyd Knibbs and the Skatalites on television. "I saw [Knibbs] playing and I thought, 'I want to be a drummer' because he's the hardest worker in the band," he said in a 1997 interview. "He's my idol! In some ways, I'm self-taught but I got a lot of help from other drummers by watching them play." In his teens, Dunbar met bassist Robbie Shakespeare and formed the rhythm section of the Revolutionaries, who became regular session musicians at the famed Channel One recording studio. Their sound differed from the melody-rich music of Bob Marley, with a heavier emphasis on the beat - including the pioneering "rockers" rhythm, which introduced more syncopation and energy to the music. They spent the 1970s working with major reggae acts like Gregory Isaacs, Dennis Brown and Barrington Levy, while touring the US with Peter Tosh. According to legend, the duo lived on bread and water in that period, hoping to save enough money to start their own production company. Taxi Records was duly founded in 1980, and nurtured a new generation of Jamaican artists such as Shaggy, Shabba Ranks, Skip Marley, Beenie Man and Red Dragon. Around the same time, they provided the thunderous beats on Grace Jones's hit 1981 album Nightclubbing, which opened the doors for them to work with some of rock and pop's greatest - from Dylan and Joe Cocker, to singers like Marianne Faithfull, Madonna and Sinead O'Connor. At home, they earned a reputation for updating the sound of reggae by incorporating more electronic instruments and textures. Later on, they developed a bright and melodic take on dancehall with the duo Chaka Demus & Pliers, scoring hits with songs such as Tease Me and Murder She Wrote in the early 1990s. At one point, Shakespeare (who died in 2021) estimated that he and Dunbar had taken part in more than 200,000 recordings, either their own or as backup musicians or producers for other artists. "When you buy a reggae record, there's a 90% chance the drummer is Sly Dunbar," producer Brian Eno told the New Music New York festival in 1979. "You get the impression that Sly Dunbar is chained to a studio seat somewhere in Jamaica, but in fact what happens is that his drum tracks are so interesting, they get used again and again." Dunbar's wife said she had found him unresponsive in bed at around 07:00 on Monday, 26 January. "I went to wake him up and he wasn't responding, I called the doctor and that was the news," she said. An exact cause of death was not given, though Dunbar had reportedly been ill for some time. "Yesterday was such a good day for him," Thelma told Jamaica's Gleaner newspaper. "He had friends come over to visit him and we all had such a good time. He ate well yesterday... sometimes he's not into food. I knew he was sick... but I didn't know that he was this sick." Among those paying tribute was British DJ David Rodigan, who called Dunbar a "true icon" and "one of the greatest drummers of all time".

**Excerpt**

Israel says it has retrieved remains of final Gaza hostage The Israeli military says it has retrieved the body of the last hostage in Gaza, paving the way for the next phase of US President Donald Trump's peace plan to get under way. It had been searching for Master Sgt Ran Gvili since the ceasefire with Hamas began in October. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Gvili's return "an extraordinary achievement". The Israeli military began searching a cemetery for Gvili on Sunday morning. Hamas's armed wing said it had provided mediators with "all the details and information" about Gvili's location. Netanyahu's office said Israel would reopen Gaza's key border crossing with Egypt once the operation to find and return Gvili was complete. The prime minister hailed the return of Gvili's body, saying: "We promised - and I promised - to bring everyone back. We brought them all back, down to the very last captive," he said. The Israeli military said the clarification of existing intelligence over the weekend had enabled the search of the cemetery near Gaza City. A military official said the cemetery "was located in the area of the Yellow Line", the boundary to territory still controlled by Israeli forces under the ceasefire deal. Hamas said it had "kept updating the mediators with the necessary information, which resulted in retrieving the body". Spokesman Hazem Qassem said the discovery "confirms Hamas's commitment to all the requirements of the ceasefire agreement". In Israel, Itzik Gvili, the hostage's father, paid an emotional goodbye to his son in front of his coffin. "You had the option to stay home, but you said to me: 'Father, I'm not going to leave my friends to fight alone.' "You came out, and you need to see the honour you have here, all the people who brought you. All the police are here with you, the entire army is here with you, the entire nation is here with you. I'm proud of you, my son," Itzik Gvili said. Rani Gvili's sister Shira earlier told the Hostages and Missing Families Forum: "I feel an insane sense of relief. I feel relieved. I am sad. I'm very sad that it ended this way, but it had to end at some point. I am so happy he's coming back home." The retrieval of Gvili may bring closure to his family and it finally ends Israel's hostage agony after 843 days. It also opens the way for further progress in Gaza's ceasefire deal. Israel had resisted moving forward until Gvili was found. Phase two is meant to involve the reconstruction and full demilitarisation of Gaza, including the disarmament of Hamas and other Palestinian groups. The plan is also meant to see the deployment of an as-yet unconstituted International Stabilization Force (ISF) and the progressive withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. On Friday, the Gvili family gathered in Tel Aviv's Hostages Square, as they had every week since he and the other 250 were abducted on 7 October 2023. "I looked them in the eyes and said: 'We will bring Rani home'," Netanyahu recounted on Monday. "I promised you, citizens of Israel: We will bring everyone home." It is a promise finally delivered, and will be celebrated, but his critics say it has taken too long and cost too many lives - Israeli and Palestinian. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announced Gvili's retrieval in a statement, saying: "According to the information and intelligence available to us, Sgt Maj (res) Ran Gvili... a Yamam commando fighter, aged 24 at the time of his death, fell in battle on the morning of October 7, 2023, and his body was abducted to the Gaza Strip. "The IDF shares in the family's grief. The IDF will continue to accompany the families and the returned hostages and to act to strengthen the security of Israel's citizens. "With this, all of the hostages from the Gaza Strip area have been returned." Netanyahu said he sent soldiers into Gaza to return the hostages and defeat Hamas. Opening the Rafah border crossing is an important next step but other difficult issues have to be confronted. How will Hamas be disarmed and unpicked from the fabric of Gaza? When will Israel's army withdraw? And who will make up the international force delivering security for the future? This is the first time since 2014 there are no Israeli hostages, alive or dead, being held in Gaza - a reminder of the deep roots of this conflict and how difficult it could still be to shape a lasting peace. Reacting to the return of Gvili's body, Trump posted on Truth Social: "Just recovered the last Hostage body in GAZA. Thus, got back ALL 20 of the living Hostages, and ALL of the Dead! AMAZING JOB!" The president said "most thought of it as an impossible thing to do" and congratulated his "great team of Champions". Hamas was meant to return all hostages, alive and dead, within 72 hours of the ceasefire taking effect. The process took far longer, but eventually 20 living Israeli hostages and the bodies of 27 dead Israeli and foreign hostages were handed over, leaving only Gvili missing. The policeman was one of 251 hostages taken in the Hamas-led attack on Israel on 7 October 2023 in which about 1,200 people were killed. Most of the hostages were released alive over the course of the next two years in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza. Israel's military campaign in Gaza, launched in response to the attack, has killed 71,660 Palestinians, the Hamas-run health ministry has said.

Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp to trial premium subscriptions Technology giant Meta is set to trial premium subscriptions for Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp users in the coming months in its latest experiment with paid services. The new offerings would give access to features including expanded artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities. Under the plan, access to the platforms' core services would remain free to use. The firm also plans to test subscriptions for features, such as its Vibes video generation app, which the firm says "can bring your ideas to life with new AI visual creation tools". Meta announced Vibes in September as part of the latest version of the Meta AI app. It also aims to use Manus, a Chinese-founded AI firm it agreed to buy in December for a reported $2bn (£1.46bn), in its subscription plans, according to TechCrunch, which first reported the story. The company will also continue to offer standalone Manus subscriptions to businesses. At the time, Meta said the deal would help improve its own AI by giving people access to "agents" - tools which can do complex things with minimal user interaction such as planning trips or making presentations. "Manus's exceptional talent will join Meta's team to deliver general-purpose agents across our consumer and business products, including Meta AI," it said in a blog post. Based in Singapore after relocating from China, Manus has sought to set itself apart from rival AI developers with what it claims can be a "truly autonomous" agent. Unlike many chatbots which need to be repeatedly asked for things before a user can get their desired response, Manus says its service can plan, execute and complete tasks independently in accordance with instructions. In January, Beijing said it would investigate the Meta deal to assess whether it broke China's technology export laws or national security regulations. Last year, Facebook tested placing a limit on how many links some users can share when they post on the social media platform. Notifications seen by some users based in the UK and US said they could only share a certain number of links in Facebook posts without a subscription. The company described it as "a limited test to understand whether the ability to publish an increased volume of posts with links adds additional value" for subscribers. In 2023, Meta started to roll out a paid verification service that gives Facebook and Instagram users a blue tick for a monthly fee.

Can India be a player in the computer chip industry? A reliable supply of computer chips is essential for Arnob Roy, the co-founder of Tejas Networks. His company, based in Bangalore, India, supplies the equipment behind mobile phone networks and broadband connections. "Essentially, we provide the electronics that carry traffic across telecom networks," he says. That requires special chips designed for telecoms tasks. "Telecom chips are fundamentally different from consumer or smartphone chips. They handle massive volumes of data coming simultaneously from hundreds of thousands of users. "These networks cannot go down. Reliability, redundancy and fail-safe operation are critical - the chip architecture has to support that," Roy says. Tejas designs many of those chips in India, a country well known for its expertise in designing computer chips (also known as semiconductors). It's estimated that 20% of the world's semiconductor engineers are in India. "Almost every major global chip company has its largest or second-largest design centre in India, working on cutting-edge products," says Amitesh Kumar Sinha, Joint Secretary of India's Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology. What India lacks is companies that manufacture semiconductors. So Indian firms like Tejas Neworks design the chips they need in India, but then have them manufactured overseas. The weakness of that system was exposed during Covid, when the supply of chips dried up and companies in all sorts of industries had to scale back production. "The pandemic made it clear that semiconductor manufacturing is too concentrated globally, and that concentration carries serious risk," Roy says. That spurred India to develop its own semiconductor industry. "Covid showed us how fragile global supply chains can be. If one part of the world shuts down, electronics manufacturing everywhere is disrupted," says Sinha. "That's why India is developing its own semiconductor ecosystem to reduce risk and increase resilience," he adds. He is leading government efforts to develop the semiconductor industry, which involves identifying parts of the production process where India can compete. There are several steps in making a computer chip. First design, where India is already strong. The second stage is wafer fabrication, where thin sheets of silicon have circuits etched on to them by extremely expensive machines in huge factories known as semiconductor "fabs". That part of the process, particularly for the most sophisticated chips, is dominated by companies in Taiwan, with China trying to catch up. In the third stage those large silicon wafers are sliced up into individual chips, packaged in protective casing, connected to contacts and tested. That third stage, known as Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test (Osat), is the part of the production process targeted by India. "Assembly, test and packaging are easier to start than fabs and that is where India is moving first," says Ashok Chandak, president of India Electronics and Semiconductor Association (IESA). He says that several such plants will "enter mass production" this year. Founded in 2023, Kaynes Semicon is the first company to get a semiconductor plant up and running with support from the Indian government. Kaynes Semicon invested $260m (£270m) in a factory to assemble and test computer chips in the northwestern state of Gujarat. Production started in November of last year. "Packaging is not just putting a chip in a box. It's a 10 to 12 step manufacturing process," says Raghu Panicker, CEO of Kaynes Semicon. "That's why packaging and testing are as critical as making the chip itself without this stage, the wafer is useless to industry." His facility will not be making the most advanced computer chips found in the latest mobile phones or used for training AI. "India does not need the most complex datacentre or AI chips on day one. That is not where our demand is, and that is not where our strength lies today," Panicker says. Instead, they will be the kind of chips used in cars, telecoms and the defence industry. "These are not glamorous chips, but they are economically and strategically far more important for India. You build an industry by first serving your own market. Complexity can come later. Scale has to come first," he adds. It's been a steep learning curve for Kaynes Semicon. "We had never built a semiconductor cleanroom in India before. We had never installed this equipment before. We had never trained people for this before," Panicker says. "Semiconductors demand a level of discipline, documentation and process control that is very different from traditional manufacturing. That cultural shift is as important as the technical one." Getting staff trained has been a huge challenge. "Training takes time. You cannot shortcut five years of experience into six months. That is the single biggest bottleneck," Panicker says. Back in Bangalore, at Tejas Networks, Arnob Roy is looking forward to buying more locally-sourced tech. "Over the next decade, we expect a significant semiconductor manufacturing base to emerge in India and that will directly help companies like ours." It's the start of a long journey, he says. "I do see Indian companies eventually designing and manufacturing complete telecom chipsets but it will take patient capital and time. "Deep-tech products take longer to mature, and India is only now beginning to support that kind of investment."

Tech giants face landmark trial over social media addiction claims A landmark social media addiction trial in which top tech executives are expected to testify begins on Tuesday in California. The plaintiff, a 19-year-old woman identified by the initials KGM, alleges the design of the platforms' algorithms left her addicted to social media and negatively affected her mental health. The defendants include Meta - which owns Instagram and Facebook - TikTok's owner ByteDance and YouTube parent Google. Snapchat settled with the plaintiff last week. The closely-watched case at Los Angeles Superior Court is the first in a wave of such lawsuits, which could challenge a legal theory used by tech firms to shield themselves from culpability in the US. 'Dangerous and addictive algorithms' The named social media companies have said the plaintiff's evidence falls short of proving they are responsible for alleged harms such as depression and eating disorders. The case going to trial marks a distinct shift in how the US legal system treats tech firms, which face mounting claims that their products lead to addictive behaviours. The companies have long argued that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, passed by Congress in 1996, exempts platforms from liability for what third parties post. But at issue in this case are design choices about algorithms, notifications and other features that affect how people use their apps. KGM's attorney, Matthew Bergman, told the BBC the case will be the first time a social media company has been held to account by a jury at trial. "Unfortunately, there are all too many kids in the United States, the UK, and around the world who are suffering as KGM does because of the dangerous and addictive algorithms that the social media platforms foist on unsuspecting kids," he said. "These companies are going to have to explain to a jury why their profits were more important than the lives of our young people." Eric Goldman, a law professor at Santa Clara University, told the BBC that losing these cases in court could pose an existential threat to the social media companies. But he said it may be difficult for plaintiffs to prove physical harms can be blamed on content publishers. "The fact that the plaintiffs have been able to sell that idea has opened the door to a whole bunch of new legal questions that the law wasn't really designed to answer," he said. 'The tech industry has been given deferential treatment' At trial, jurors are expected to see an array of evidence, including excerpts from internal company documents. "A lot of what these companies have been trying to shield from the public is likely going to be aired in court," said Mary Graw Leary, a law professor at Catholic University of America. Meta previously said it introduced dozens of tools to support a safe environment for teens online, but some researchers have disputed the effectiveness of the recent measures. The companies are expected to argue any asserted harms are caused by third-party users. One highly-anticipated witness the jury will hear from is Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg, who is due to testify early in the trial. In 2024, he told US senators "the existing body of scientific work has not shown any causal link between social media and young people having worse mental health outcomes". During that same hearing, at the prodding of one senator, Zuckerberg apologised to victims and their loved ones who had crowded into the chamber. Tech executives "are often not good under pressure" said Mary Anne Franks, a law professor at George Washington University. She said the firms were "very much much hoping" they could avoid having top bosses testify. The trial comes as the companies face growing scrutiny from families, school districts, and prosecutors worldwide. Last year, dozens of US states sued Meta, alleging the company misled the public over risks of social media use and had contributed to a youth mental health crisis. Australia has enacted a social media ban on under-16s, and the UK signalled in January it may follow. "There is a tipping point when it comes to the harms of social media," Franks said. "The tech industry has been given deferential treatment - I think we're seeing that start to change."
