'We all know someone who was killed' - Iran protesters tell BBC of brutal crackdown "My friends are all like me. We all know someone who was killed in the protests." For Parisa, a 29-year-old from Tehran, the crackdown by security forces in Iran earlier this month was unlike anything she had witnessed before. "In the most widespread previous protests, I didn't personally know a single person who had been killed," she said. Parisa said she knew at least 13 people who had been killed since protests over worsening economic conditions erupted in the capital on 28 December and then evolved into one of the deadliest periods of anti-government unrest in the history of the Islamic Republic. With one human rights group reporting that the number of people confirmed killed has passed 6,000, several young Iranians able speak to the BBC in recent days, despite a near-total internet shutdown, have described the personal toll. Parisa said one 26-year-old woman she knew was killed by "a hail of bullets in the street" when the protests escalated across the country on Thursday, 8 January, and Friday, 9 January, and authorities responded with lethal force to crush them. She herself took part in protests in the north of Tehran that Thursday, which she insisted were peaceful. "No-one was violent and no-one clashed with the security forces. But on Friday night they still opened fire on the crowd," she said. "The smell of gunpowder and bullets filled the neighbourhoods where clashes were taking place." Mehdi, 24, who is also from Tehran, echoed her assessment of the scale of the protests and violence. "I had never seen anything even close to this level of turnout and such killings and violence by the security forces," he said. "Despite the killings on Thursday [8 January] and threats of more killings on Friday, people came out, because many of them could no longer endure it and had nothing left to lose," he added. Mehdi described witnessing multiple killings of protesters at close range by security forces. "I saw a young man killed right in front of my eyes with two live rounds," he said. "Motorcyclists shot a young man in the face with a shotgun. He fell on the spot and never got back up." The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (Hrana) says it has so far confirmed the killing of at least 6,159 people since the unrest began, including 5,804 protesters, 92 children and 214 people affiliated with the government. It is also investigating 17,000 more reported deaths. Skylar Thompson, from Hrana, told the BBC the confirmed number of dead was very likely to rise. "We are really committed to ensuring that every single piece of verified information that we report on sits next to a name and a location," she added. Another group, Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR), has warned that the final toll could exceed 25,000. Iranian authorities said last week that more than 3,100 people had been killed, but that the majority were security personnel or bystanders attacked by "rioters". Most international news organisations, including the BBC, are barred from reporting inside Iran. But videos showing security forces firing live ammunition at crowds have been verified by the BBC. Sahar, a 27-year-old from the capital, said she knew seven people who had been killed. She described how the security forces' response to the unrest escalated rapidly on 8 January. During a protest that evening, Sahar and her friends sought refuge in a nearby house after tear gas was fired. "My friend stuck his head out of a window to see what was going on and they shot him in the neck," she said. Another friend was wounded by pellets and later bled to death after avoiding going to hospital out of fear of being detained, according to Sahar. Sahar said a third friend died while being detained by the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC). "They [officers] told his family to come to the IRGC intelligence office. After a few days they rang and said, 'Come and collect the body.'" On 9 January, Sahar said, live ammunition was fired openly and "without mercy" by uniformed security personnel. "They were pointing lasers at people, and locals were opening their car park doors for us to hide," she said. The communications blackout compounded the trauma. "Right now there's no news at all," Sahar said. "Without internet or phone lines we had no idea what was happening to anyone. We could barely get calls through just to get bits of news." Parham, 27, described widespread use of pellet guns by security forces in Tehran, particularly targeting protesters' faces and eyes. One of his friends, Sina, 23, was shot in the forehead and eye on 9 January. "We took him to a hospital, but the doctor could only give us a prescription and told us to leave as soon as possible," Parham said. At an eye hospital, he added, wounded protesters arrived constantly. "Every 10 minutes, it felt like they were bringing in someone else who had been hit by a pellet." A worker at the hospital's cafe said she had seen "70 people with eye injuries come in during a single shift", according to Parham. Sina - who still has pellets stuck behind one of his eyes and in his forehead - said they had been scared of being arrested at the first hospital because of the need to give their ID numbers, so they had gone to a private eye hospital. He said he was "lucky" compared to the others who he saw at the eye hospital, who had "pellets all over their faces and in both of their eyes". The BBC has seen a medical document in Sina's name that says "there is a 5mm metallic foreign body" behind his eye. The medical records of a number of other protesters with pellet-gun wounds have also been received and verified by the BBC. Protesters and activists have also described a pattern of refusal by the authorities to hand over the bodies of those killed to their families. Mehdi said his friend's cousin was killed and that the family was told by officials to either pay a large sum of money to receive his body or agree to him being recorded as a member of the security forces. "They said, 'Either pay 1 billion tomans [more than $7,000; £5,000] for us to hand over the body to the family, or you have to say he was a member of the Basij and was martyred for public security and against the riots.'" Navid, a 38-year-old from Isfahan, also said two close friends whose relatives were killed had received such an ultimatum. "They say you have to pay the equivalent of several thousand dollars or let us issue them a Basij card so they are counted among the security forces' dead," he cited his friends as saying. Human rights groups have warned that this practice has served both to punish protesters' families and obscure the true death toll.

**Excerpt**

Former French senator found guilty of drugging MP A former French senator has been found guilty of spiking an MP's drink with ecstasy in order to sexually assault her. Joel Guerriau received a four-year prison sentence - 18 months of which are to be served behind bars - and, according to local media, was ordered to pay Sandrine Josso €5,000 (£4,348) in damages for emotional distress. Guerriau, now 68, had invited Josso, 50, to his Paris flat in November 2023. He later admitted serving her a drink spiked with MDMA, but maintained it was an accident and denied having any intention of assaulting her. Shortly after the verdict on Tuesday, Josso said it was a "huge relief", AFP reports. Meanwhile, Guerriau's lawyers said he would appeal. According to court documents quoted by French media, Josso said she had gone to Guerrieau's home three years ago to celebrate his re-election when she started feeling unwell after drinking from a champagne glass. "I had gone to visit a friend and I discovered an aggressor," she said on Monday while giving evidence in the trial. "He looked at me insistently, I'd never seen him that way. I didn't want to show him my weakness, because I was worried that if I told him I wasn't feeling well, he would've forced me to lie down." Josso recalled managing to leave the flat and, with the help of a colleague, went to hospital where a toxicology report confirmed her blood had three times the recreational dose of MDMA. Guerriau told the court he had been going through a period of depression, and had meant to take the drug himself the night before. He did not end up doing so and accidentally offered the glass containing MDMA to Josso the following evening, he said. "I feel sorry for Sandrine," Guerriau told the court in Paris. "I am disgusted with myself, with my recklessness and my stupidity." He added: "We don't talk about the effects of these drugs enough... All I want is to speak out on the dangers of these products." Asked about the several internet searches he made around ecstasy and the drug GHB, he said he had no recollection. "I was on the train, thoughts and ideas just come to you," he told the court, adding government members needed to show an interest in "all current events". Guerriau, a centre-right senator from the Horizons party, was suspended when the charges against him came to light. He resigned as a senator last October. Josso, who is still an MP for the centre-right MoDem, has become a staunch campaigner against so-called chemical submission - drug-facilitated sexual assault. "What I went through is still very painful," Josso said, speaking to French media ahead of the trial beginning. "Psychological trauma feels like being frozen in time... I jump at the slightest thing. I've become very vulnerable." Josso has gone on to join an association against chemical submission, set up by Caroline Darian - the daughter of Dominique Pelicot, who in 2024 was found guilty of drugging his wife Gisele and inviting men to rape her in their home for over a decade. Josso was often in court during the Pelicot trial. This week, Darian and her brother David attended the proceedings in the Guerriau case.

Spain plans to give half a million undocumented migrants legal status The Spanish government has announced a plan to legalise the status of undocumented migrants, a measure expected to benefit at least half a million people. Regularisation will be available to foreign nationals who do not have a criminal record and can prove they lived in Spain for at least five months prior to 31 December 2025. "This is an historic day for our country," said Elma Saiz, Spain's minister of inclusion, social security and migration. The measure will provide beneficiaries with an initial one-year residence permit, which can then be extended. Requests for legalisation are expected to begin in April and the process will remain open until the end of June. "We are reinforcing a migratory model based on human rights, integration, co-existence and which is compatible with economic growth and social cohesion," Saiz said. Spain has seen a large influx of migrants in recent years, mainly from Latin America. The conservative think-tank Funcas found that the number of undocumented migrants in Spain had risen from 107,409 in 2017 to 837,938 in 2025 - an eight-fold increase. The highest number of undocumented arrivals currently living in Spain are believed to be from Colombia, Peru and Honduras. Spain's socialist-led coalition government has been an outlier on this issue among the larger European nations, underlining the importance of migrants for the economy. The country has been outperforming the other main EU economies in recent years, posting expected growth of close to 3% in 2025. Unemployment, a longstanding weakness of the Spanish economy, has dipped below 10% for the first time since 2008, according to figures released on Tuesday. Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has described immigrants as representing "wealth, development and prosperity" for Spain, pointing to their contribution to the social security system. The government and parties on the left have also emphasised the need to treat migrants in a humane way. "Providing rights is the answer to racism," said Irene Montero, of the far-left Podemos party and a former minister in a coalition government with the Socialists. She has campaigned for this measure, which followed an agreement between the party and the government. A civic legislative proposal, calling for a mass migrant regularisation, received the support of around 700,000 people but had been languishing in parliament. This measure will be approved by royal decree, meaning it does not require parliamentary approval. It is the first large-scale migrant regularisation in Spain for two decades. Several such initiatives, by governments of both the Socialists and the conservative People's Party (PP), legalised the status of an estimated half a million migrants between 1986 and 2005. However, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, leader of the PP, said the latest mass legalisation would "increase the pull effect and overwhelm our public services". Pepa Millán, spokeswoman for the far-right Vox, said the initiative "attacks our identity", adding that the party would appeal before the Supreme Court in a bid to block it.

Families sue US over deadly boat strike off Venezuela coast The families of two Trinidadian men killed in a US strike on an alleged drug-smuggling boat have filed a lawsuit against the American government. Lawyers filed the claim in Boston's federal court on behalf of relatives of Chad Joseph and Rishi Samaroo, among six men killed off the coast of Venezuela on 14 October. One of the lawyers said in a statement that the strike amounted to "lawless killings in cold blood; killings for sport and killings for theatre". The US has struck at least 36 vessels in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific since September, killing more than 120 people. The Trump administration has said it is targeting "narco-terrorists" carrying drugs that kill Americans. The US has positioned its operations as a non-international armed conflict with the alleged traffickers, but legal experts say they could be in violation of the laws governing such conflict. This lawsuit was filed on Tuesday under the Death on the High Seas Act, which allows family members to sue for wrongful deaths on the high seas, and is a statute that allows foreign citizens to sue in US courts for violating international law. The case was brought by Joseph's mother and Samaroo's sister, who say the two men did fishing and farm work in Venezuela, and were returning to Trinidad and Tobago when their boat was struck. Joseph's mother Sallycar Korasingh added that if the US government believed her son had done something wrong, "it should have arrested, charged and detained him, not murdered him". The lawsuit argues that the killings should be deemed a wrongful death because the men were not taking part in military hostilities against the US. The Pentagon has not yet responded to requests for comment. It comes after the family of a Colombian man, who was killed in a separate US strike, took their case to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.

**Excerpt**

'Crying horse' toys go viral in China ahead of Lunar New Year A frowning horse plush has become a viral bestseller ahead of Lunar New Year celebrations for the year of the horse in China. The sad-looking soft toy was originally made in error after a worker sewed a smile on the horse upside down, the owner of Happy Sister - a shop in the eastern city of Yiwu - told Reuters news agency. Zhang Huoqing had expected to have to issue a refund to the customer who bought the toy, but after an image of it started circulating online the horse began selling out. Zhang said the animal's gloomy expression was resonating with young workers in China. "A lot of customers like it, and they said it makes sense: that it suits the spirit of today's corporate slaves," Zhang said. "This crying horse really fits the reality of modern working people," she added. "People joked that the crying horse is how you look at work, while the smiling one is how you look after work." Zhang's factory has surged production to meet demand - including from other countries, according to media reports. One buyer, known online as Tuan Tuan Mami, was quoted by the South China Morning Post as saying: "This little horse looks so sad and pitiful, just like the way I feel at work. "With this crying toy in the Year of the Horse, I hope to leave all my grievances at work behind and keep only happiness." The newspaper says the horse is about 20cm (7.8in) tall and costs 25 yuan (£2.62). It is red for good luck, with a golden collar and bell around its neck, and has the phrase "money comes quickly" embroidered on its body in golden letters. Another shop owner in Yiwu, Lou Zhenxian, told Reuters she thought the toy was ugly, but "it's the kind of emotional value young people look for these days". She described young people going to work in the kind of state like the crying horse, and when you get off work "being immediately happy". "But actually if everyone chases that kind of sentiment, the young people's way of thinking, it's not quite right. I believe you should work hard when at work and be happy after work, it shouldn't be two extreme opposites," she said. Lunar New Year will be celebrated in February to usher in the year of the horse - one of 12 animals repeated in a cycle under the Chinese zodiac calendar.

### 6. [India and EU announce 'mother of all trade deals'](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crrnee01r9jo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

India and EU announce 'mother of all trade deals' The European Union and India have announced a landmark trade deal after nearly two decades of on-off talks, as both sides aim to deepen ties amid tensions with the US. "We did it, we delivered the mother of all deals," European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said at a media briefing in Delhi. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the pact "historic". It will allow free trade of goods between the bloc of 27 European states and the world's most populous country, which together make up nearly 25% of global gross domestic product and a market of two billion people. The deal will see a number of huge tariff cuts across a range of goods and services, and a joint security partnership. Von der Leyen and European Council President António Costa are in Delhi, where they met Modi at a bilateral summit. The European Commission said would eliminate tariffs on most exports of chemicals, machinery and electrical equipment, as well as aircraft and spacecraft, following phased reductions. Significantly, duties on motor vehicles, currently as high as 110%, would be cut to 10% under a quota of 250,000 vehicles. That is six times larger than the 37,000-unit quota India granted to the UK in a deal signed last July. India will also cut tariffs on wine, beer and olive oil from the EU. Brussels said the agreement would support investment flows, improve access to European markets and deepen supply-chain integration. Delhi said almost all of its exports would get "preferential access" into the EU, with textiles, leather, marine products, handicrafts, gems and jewellery set to see a reduction or elimination of tariffs. While commodities such as tea, coffee, spices and processed foods will benefit from the agreement, Delhi "has prudently safeguarded sensitive sectors, including dairy, cereals, poultry, soy meal, certain fruits and vegetables, balancing export growth with domestic priorities", it said. Delhi and Brussels have also agreed on a mobility framework that eases restrictions for professionals to travel between India and the EU in the short term. "This is India's biggest free trade agreement," Modi said. "It will make access to European markets easier for India's farmers and small business. It will also boost manufacturing and services sectors. It will boost innovative partnerships." The trade deal comes as both India and the EU contend with economic and geopolitical pressure from the US. Delhi is grappling with 50% tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump last year amid talks aimed at securing a trade deal between India and the US that are still dragging on. Last week, Trump threatened to escalate his trade war with European allies for opposing a US takeover of Greenland, before backing off. That larger geopolitical context was evident in statements made by leaders. On Tuesday, von der Leyen said: "This is the tale of two giants - the world's second and fourth largest economies. Two giants which chose partnership in a true win-win fashion. A strong message that co-operation is the best answer to global challenges." A day before that Costa had said, without naming the US, that the trade deal would send an "important political message to the world that India and the EU believe more in trade agreements than in tariffs". The deal with the European Union may help labour-intensive sectors in India such as shrimp farming, textiles, gems and jewellery, which were hit hard by the US tariffs, experts say. But some analysts also predict challenges - especially when it comes to compliance with EU regulations and standards. "The EU has very strict regulations, for instance, on environment. It is one of the leaders when it comes to carbon offsetting mechanisms," says economist Mitali Nikore. She says India's manufacturing sector "might not be fully prepared" for this and that it is critical that it takes steps to fix this. "It is an opportunity more than a challenge," she says. For the EU, the deal is aimed at providing some certainty, even security, in a time of economic coercion and global turbulence. Germany and France are projected to be among the biggest beneficiaries even if this isn't the "super maximally ambitious" version of a trade deal once envisioned, says Andrew Small, Asia director at the European Council on Foreign Relations. However, he says, the agreement is seen as a building block rather than a final destination as the EU looks to tap into a massive, fast-growing economy. "It really is understood as a floor for what is possible for the bilateral relationship." The formal signing is likely to take place only later this year, after the agreement is approved by the European Parliament and member states. There may be some concerns around this after another major trade deal the EU struck with the Mercosur bloc of South American countries was recently derailed in the European Parliament. However, the India agreement is regarded as less contentious as it "cuts around sensitives on both sides," says Small. Alongside the trade agreement, India and the European Union are also advancing separate talks on security and defence co-operation, and climate action. On Tuesday, India's Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said he had discussed a range of bilateral security and defence issues with the European Commission's vice-president Kaja Kallas, including opportunities to integrate supply chains to build trusted defence ecosystems and develop future-ready capabilities. The two sides are working on a draft security and defence partnership covering areas such as maritime security, cyber threats and defence dialogue, Reuters news agency reported. The EU is India's largest trading partner in goods, with bilateral merchandise trade reaching $136bn (£99.4bn) in 2024-25, nearly doubling over a decade. Talks for a deal started in 2007 but stalled in 2013 over roadblocks in market access and regulatory demands. Discussions were formally restarted in July 2022. Trump's tariffs proved to be a "useful tailwind in the homestretch" to get the deal over the line, one EU diplomat told the BBC. In the past seven months, India has signed major trade agreements with the UK, Oman and New Zealand, and a 2024 pact signed with the four-nation European Free Trade Association bloc of Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein came into effect last year. It signed a trade pact with Australia in 2022.

**Excerpt**

Firefighters battle 'emergency level' blazes in Australia heatwave Firefighters in the Australian state of Victoria are battling at least six major fires as a record-breaking heatwave hits the country's south-east. Two fires are currently burning at "emergency level" according to local broadcaster ABC News. Several communities have been issued emergency warnings to either evacuate, watch and wait, or shelter in place. Fire officials warn that the situation is changing rapidly and have asked locals to stay up to date with the latest warnings. The Bureau of Meteorology says that parts of the state have seen all-time temperature highs - with one area hitting a high of 48.9C. Melbourne has recorded a temperature of 41C. Chris Hardman, the chief fire officer at Forest Fire Management Victoria, had told reporters that the state's heat conditions were making conditions "incredibly difficult" for firefighters. Two fires - in Camperdown and Otways - are burning at emergency level. A new fire in the Larralea area is also causing "significant concern". Country Fire Authority (CFA) chief officer Jason Heffernan told ABC Radio that there was a danger that the Otways fire could produce ember showers "which can create more fires in front of the main fire". It is unclear what damage has been caused by the fires, but Australia's Deputy Incident Controller Alistair Drayton, said he had "anecdotal evidence" that some homes had been lost. He also praised the "spectacular" work done by firefighters so far. Apart from Victoria, where there is a total fire ban, South Australia has also been placed under alert for "extreme" fire risk. Meanhwile health officials have warned that the prolonged heat carries significant health risks. The elderly, children and people with underlying health conditions are most at risk, Victoria chief health officer Caroline McElnay told reporters. "It can cause potentially fatal health problems such as heat exhaustion and heat stroke but it can also trigger events like heart attacks or stroke." Scientists are clear that human-caused climate change is making heatwaves much more likely and more intense globally. And Australasia has seen an increasing frequency and severity of heat extremes in recent decades, according to the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). South-east Australia also experienced extreme heat in early January, with temperatures surpassing 40C. A rapid study by scientists at the World Weather Attribution group estimated that the high temperatures across a three-day period were now at least five times more likely as a result of climate change. While fires occur naturally in Australia, these hot, dry conditions can make it much easier for fires to spread, potentially fuelling larger blazes. And as the world continues to warm, Australia is expected to see further increases in these "fire weather" conditions, according to the IPCC. Additional reporting by Mark Poynting

**Excerpt**

Carney denies walking back Davos speech in phone call with Trump Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has told reporters he stands behind his speech in Davos calling out unconstrained super powers, after a Trump official said he had "aggressively" walked it back in a call with US President Donald Trump. "To be absolutely clear, and I said this to the president, I meant what I said in Davos," Carney said on Tuesday, confirming he and Trump had spoken by phone. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had told Fox News on Monday that Carney was "very aggressively walking back" some of the remarks to Trump. Carney made global headlines for his Davos speech, in which he indirectly called out the US president for a "rupture" in the postwar world order. Trump responded in his own Davos speech the following day by saying that "Canada lives because of the United States". Speaking to reporters in Ottawa on Tuesday, Carney denied Bessent's recollection of the phone call. He added that it was the US president who had called him on Monday, and that the two had a "very good conversation on a wide range of subjects", including Ukraine, Venezuela, Arctic security and Canada's recent trade agreement with China. Carney said the two also discussed the USMCA, a free-trade pact between Canada, the US and Mexico that is up for a mandatory review later this year. Carney said his speech in Davos clearly outlined how "Canada was the first country to understand the change in US trade policy that (Trump) had initiated, and we're responding to that". He added that the president understood Canada's position. In the Fox News interview on Monday, Bessent criticised Canada's decision to negotiate a trade deal with China. He added that he was "not sure what the Prime Minister was thinking" when he made his speech in Davos. "Canada depends on the US," Bessent said. "There's much more north-south trade then there could ever be east-west trade." "The prime minister should do what's best for the Canadian people rather than try to push his globalist agenda," the treasury secretary added. His remarks came after Trump threatened Canada with 100% tariffs on its goods if it allows Chinese goods to flow freely to the US, skirting levies. The deal between Ottawa and Beijing would lower levies on Canadian canola oil from 85% to 15% by March, while Canada will tax a limited number of Chinese electric vehicles, or EVs, at the most-favoured-nation rate, 6.1% – down from 100%. Carney said that Canada is not pursuing a free-trade deal with China and has "never" considered it. Speaking to reporters on Monday, Carney added that he believed Trump's latest tariff threat is a negotiation tactic ahead of talks on USMCA. "The president is a strong negotiator, and I think some of these comments and positioning should be viewed in the broader context of that," he said.

**Excerpt**

Sweden aims to lower age of criminal responsibility to 13 as gangs recruit children Sweden is moving forward with plans to lower the age of criminal responsibility from 15 to 13 in serious cases as it grapples with a growing number of children recruited into gangs to carry out violent crimes without facing serious legal repercussions. Justice Minister Gunnar Strommer said the country was in an "emergency situation" and stopping the use of children in criminal networks was a "crucial task" for the government. But several authorities, including police, prison officials and prosecutors, have opposed the plan, with some worried that it may lead to even younger children becoming offenders. If passed, the legislation will go into force as early as this summer. Strommer insisted that the proposal did not amount to a "general lowering of the age of criminal responsibility" and would only apply to the "most serious crimes" such as murder, attempted murder, aggravated bombings, aggravated weapons offences and aggravated rape. Under the proposal, some of these offenders could face prison sentences in certain cases. Data from the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention shows that the number of registered offences linked to suspects under the age of 15 has doubled over the past decade. The current government came into power in 2022 vowing to crack down on organised crime. At the beginning of last year, a government-ordered inquiry recommended lowering the age of criminal responsibility to 14 in serious cases. Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson confirmed in September that it would be lowered from 15, saying children are "being ruthlessly exploited by criminal networks to commit serious crimes". "Both to protect these children and their potential victims, the government is taking strong action against this type of cynical exploitation," he added. The government then announced that it would seek to lower it to 13, and sent out the bill for input from 126 authorities and organisations. Their plans were met with criticism and opposition from different authorities and organisations. In November, the police authority said that the change risked "significantly younger children" getting involved in criminal gangs as a result. Other groups said the prison system was not equipped to handle such young offenders and detaining them could breach children's rights. The prison and probation service also said the move could lead to negative consequences for children and that they should be cared for in "other ways". Ministers had also previously considered imposing age limits on social media, with police arguing that gangs had used certain platforms to recruit young children into crime. Strommer said on Monday that he had taken note of the previous criticism of the bill, but that the situation had become more urgent. However opposition has not abated. Fredrik Hjulström, a local authority head who is reviewing the proposal, said it contained "no factual arguments", according to Swedish national broadcaster SVT. He added that children should receive care rather than being punished and argued that the bill was about scoring political points, with the country's general election coming up in September this year. Meanwhile lawyer Johan Eriksson agreed that action must be taken to prevent children from being recruited by gangs, but said lowering the age of criminal responsibility would likely have the opposite effect. The bill will be sent to Sweden's Council on Legislation, which reviews bills the government intends to put before parliament.

### 10. [TikTok US pushes back on claims it is censoring content](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgjedpn8p8o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

TikTok US pushes back on claims it is censoring content TikTok has denied claims that its new US operations are heavily-controlling what users post after thousands reported glitches with the video streaming platform. In a response to the BBC, a spokesperson for TikTok US reiterated an earlier statement pointing to technical issues being the reason for problems since it became a separate American entity last week. "We've made significant progress in recovering our US infrastructure with our US data center partner," the spokesperson said. "However, the US user experience may still have some technical issues, including when posting new content." They also pushed back on users' claims they were not able to use the name "Epstein" on TikTok. It refers to Jeffrey Epstein, the dead convicted sex offender and financier. The Trump administration has continued to face fierce scrutiny for its handling of the Epstein case. TikTok said there are no rules against sharing the name "Epstein" in direct messages. Last Thursday, a deal was concluded to split off the US division of the app from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. Just days after it changed hands, thousands of American users began reporting problems including seeing "zero views" on new posts. While the TikTok said problems identified with the platform are being addressed, California Governor Gavin Newsom has nevertheless announced an investigation into claims TikTok has censored content which is critical of the Trump administration. Many also reported being unable to see political posts, such as content criticising the shooting by federal agents of ICU nurse Alex Pretti in Minneapolis on Saturday. Newsom's office said it has received confirmed reports of TikTok suppressing content critical of US President Donald Trump. "Following TikTok's sale to a Trump-aligned business group, our office has received reports - and independently confirmed instances - of suppressed content critical of President Trump," the California governor's office wrote on X on Monday. His post linked to another X user's post containing a screenshot from TikTok, that appeared to show the video-sharing app flagging up a message they tried to send saying "Epstein". It said Newsom would be "launching a review of this content" and probe whether the company had violated the state's laws. Allow X content? The same flag seemingly appeared for other US TikTok users when they tried to message others with the Epstein surname, according to social media posts seen by BBC News. Many users are speculating that this, combined with some political content not displaying in the app's For You feed or in search, may be censorship. The new US entity is being managed by a consortium of investors. These include Oracle, a cloud computing giant and sole data center partner for TikTok US, which is chaired by Larry Ellison, a Republican mega-donor and longtime Trump ally. US firm Silver Lake and Emirati investor MGX also owns stakes. Bytedance, maintains a 19.9% holding in the US business. In addition, Michael Dell, the founder of Dell Computer Corp, is a Trump donor and an investor in TikTok US. Some celebrities have spoken out over concerns about TikTok. Hacks actress Meg Stalter told Instagram followers on Sunday she had deleted her TikTok account because the app was "under new ownership and we are being completely censored and monitored". Similar views have been echoed across social media, with many US users questioning in posts whether the app is "cooked". Allow X content? "RIP TikTok 2016-2026," one user wrote in a post on Reddit. "Seems like TikTok might be dead after the US purchase". "Extremely slow" Users of the video-sharing app in the US have been posting on social media about problems throughout the outage, which began on Sunday. Platform outage monitor Downdetector told the BBC it had received 663,061 reports of issues from US users of TikTok between Saturday and Monday. "Okay so is anyone else's TikTok being extremely slow, keeps showing you old videos, doesn't show you what you what you actually search, and doesn't load certain stuff….," one X user asked on Sunday. Some users said they could not view creator monetisation tools on the app, with others noticing new videos they had uploaded to the platform did not have the same visibility as usual or were "stuck at zero views". Allow X content? TikTok's US owner said on Monday users may notice "multiple bugs, slower load times or timed-out requests" as it it worked to resolve issues triggered by a power outage at one of its data centre partner Oracle's sites. "While the network has been recovered, the outage caused a cascading systems failure that we've been working to resolve together with our data centre partner." it said. The company also sought to reassure users their data and content engagement "were safe". As with the many other issues reportedly affecting the TikTok app and its sister app CapCut since Sunday, they appeared to be largely contained to the US. As part of Trump's deal allowing TikTok to continue operating in the US, Oracle will inspect and retrain a separate version of its algorithm for American users.

### 11. [Rwanda takes legal action against UK over axed migrant deal](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czx32yxnvzro?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

Rwanda takes legal action against UK over axed migrant deal The Rwandan government has launched legal action against the UK to seek payments it claims it is owed under a scrapped migrant deal between the two countries. Rwanda has filed a case with the Netherlands-based Permanent Court of Arbitration, arguing the UK has failed to honour commitments made in a deal to send some asylum seekers to the African nation. Under the deal, which was signed by the previous Conservative government, the UK agreed to make payments to Rwanda to host asylum seekers and support its economy. But after Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer axed the deal in 2024, the Home Office said £220m in "scheduled future payments will not have to be paid" to Rwanda. A Home Office spokesperson said: "The previous government's Rwanda policy wasted vast sums of taxpayer time and money. "We will robustly defend our position to protect British taxpayers." The Rwandan government has not responded to the BBC's requests for comment. But the country's ministry of foreign affairs pointed us towards an article about the arbitration proceedings in the New Times, a Rwandan newspaper. The article says the arbitration "concerns the performance of specific commitments under the treaty". The previous Conservative government spent some £700m on the Rwanda policy, which was intended to deter migrants from crossing the English Channel in small boats. Only four volunteers arrived in Rwanda when the deal was in force and Sir Keir said the plan was "dead and buried", shortly after Labour won the 2024 general election. The deal included a break clause, which said "each party may terminate this agreement by giving notice to the other party in writing". The £700m included £290m of payments to Rwanda. In December 2024, the Home Office said a further £100m of payments would have been due under the treaty, £50m each of the 2025-26 and 2026-27 financial years. In addition, the Home Office agreed to pay £120m upon the transfer of 300 people to Rwanda. The New Times article quotes a government adviser as saying Rwanda had "engaged in diplomatic exchanges before initiating arbitration". Michael Butera, chief technical adviser to Rwanda's minister of justice, told the newspaper: "Through arbitration, Rwanda seeks a legal determination of the parties' respective rights and obligations under the treaty, in accordance with international law." In the treaty signed by Rwanda and the UK, both countries agreed any dispute that could not be settled among themselves would be referred to the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA). The PCA, which is headquartered in The Hague, Netherlands, is a forum for resolving international disputes between states. It is a process that is similar to arbitration that companies regularly agree to as an alternative to potentially damaging and lengthy court battles. The PCA has the power to issue binding, final rulings if disputes cannot be settled by the countries involved. Rwanda began the arbitration proceedings under the asylum partnership agreement in November, according to the PCA's website, which lists the case's status as pending. The PCA has not yet indicated how and when the complaint from Rwanda will be handled. The arbitration body typically sets a timetable with the parties specifying when they need to present their arguments - and the cases can take years to resolve. Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp said the legal action was "yet another catastrophic consequence of Labour's decision to scrap the Rwanda scheme before it even started". "This legal action means the British taxpayer is now facing a huge bill for Labour's weakness and incompetence," Philp said. He said Labour was "too weak to see this crucial policy through, and it's the British taxpayer who is left to pay the price". The UK government previously said it was looking at what money could be recouped after scrapping the scheme. But the Rwandan government has said it is under "no obligation" to refund any money.

**Excerpt**

One Battle After Another leads Bafta nominations Leonardo DiCaprio's politically charged thriller One Battle After Another leads the field at this year's Bafta Film Awards, with 14 nominations. It is closely followed by vampire-horror Sinners, which has 13, Shakespeare drama Hamnet and table-tennis biopic Marty Supreme, which have 11 each. Timothée Chalamet and Jessie Buckley, considered the Oscar frontrunners in the lead acting categories, repeat their nominations at the Baftas. Other stars to be recognised include two actors who were notably absent from the Oscar nominations - Chase Infiniti and Paul Mescal. That could be partly because the Baftas have more slots available - many categories have six spots compared with the five at the Oscars. The Baftas also have additional categories dedicated to recognising UK talent - outstanding British film and outstanding debut by a British writer, director or producer. I Swear, Pillion, H is for Hawk and The Ballad of Wallis Island are among the British films which are recognised in Bafta's shortlists. "It is thrilling to see British indie films and debuts in the company of blockbusters that have taken the world by storm," said Bafta chair Sara Putt. "We hope the public enjoy watching these films as much as our 8,300 BAFTA film voters have." Although several films have performed well with Bafta, none has equalled the Bafta record of 16 nominations that was achieved by 1982's Gandhi. Actor and TV presenter Alan Cumming will host the Bafta Film Awards at London's Royal Festival Hall on Sunday 22 February. There are four actors who were nominated at the Oscars who have missed out at the Baftas. They are Amy Madigan (Weapons), Delroy Lindo (Sinners), Wagner Moura (The Secret Agent) and Elle Fanning (Sentimental Value) - the latter two had not even been longlisted by Bafta. In contrast, there are other actors who missed out at the Oscars but have been nominated at the Baftas, including Jesse Plemons (Bugonia) and Odessa A'Zion (Marty Supreme). There are also more British nominees in Bafta's acting categories, such as Robert Aramayo and Peter Mullan (I Swear), Carey Mulligan (The Ballad of Wallis Island) and Emily Watson (Hamnet), while Sinners star Wunmi Mosaku repeats her Oscar nomination. Wicked: For Good might have been shut out at the Oscars, but it manages two nominations at the Baftas, for costume design and make-up and hair. Brazilian thriller The Secret Agent has two nominations - half the number it received at the Oscars, where it got into major categories including best actor and best picture. Other nominees include Frankenstein, a new take on the famous story about a mad professor and the creature he creates, and Sentimental Value, an emotive family drama about two daughters who reconnect with their estranged father. The director category, meanwhile, features the same five nominees as the Oscars, but the additional slot available at Bafta means that Yorgos Lanthimos also makes it in for conspiracy theory drama Bugonia. Brad Pitt's racing drama F1 received three Bafta nominations in technical categories, but failed to repeat its surprise inclusion in the best picture category at the Oscars. Perhaps the most notable omission is KPop Demon Hunters - the Netflix smash that was the biggest viral film hit of last year. It was ineligible for the Bafta longlists as it opened straight to Netflix in the UK without a preceding theatrical run (although a singalong version was released in cinemas later).

**Excerpt**

Philippines' Duterte fit to face ICC proceedings, judges say Judges at the International Criminal Court (ICC) have ruled that former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte is fit to attend pre-trial proceedings for alleged crimes against humanity. The ICC also will hold a hearing on 23 February to decide whether the prosecution's case against Duterte is strong enough to proceed to a trial. Duterte's lawyers earlier argued that the 80-year-old was unfit to participate in the ICC proceedings citing "cognitive impairment". He has been detained at the Hague since March 2025. He is accused of being responsible for dozens of murders under his so-called war on drugs, during which thousands of small-time drug dealers, users and others were killed without trial. Duterte was president of the Philippines from 2016 to 2022. He justified his war on drugs by saying peace and order would pave the way for economic development. Citing opinions from a panel of medical experts, ICC judges said they were "satisfied" that Duterte is "able effectively to exercise his procedural rights and is therefore fit to take part in the pre-trial proceedings". ICC judges also said in their decision on Monday that the mental capacities needed to "meaningfully exercise one's procedural and fair trial rights" did not have to be "at their notionally highest level". "This ruling tells victims that in the reckoning of Duterte at the ICC, their voices will not be sidelined by technical evasions," said Congresswoman Leila de Lima, one of Duterte's fiercest critics who was jailed during his presidency on drug charges that were later found to be false. Duterte was arrested at Manila airport in March 2025 as his family's alliance with his successor, President Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos Jr crumbled. His arrest has divided Filipinos. While his deadly drugs crackdown has drawn sharp criticism from civil society, his populist message resonates with those who feel sidelined by Manila's political elite. In May last year, Duterte was elected mayor of Davao city despite being in prison. His daughter, Vice-President Sara Duterte, is also widely expected to run for president in the 2028 elections, where Marcos is ineligible to seek a second term.

Deadly US winter storm leaves flights delayed and thousands without power Several people have died in a winter storm that hit a wide swathe of the US, causing thousands of flights to be cancelled or delayed due to severe conditions. The storm, which caused chaos from Texas to the tip of Maine over the weekend, snarled roadways, knocked out power, and buried major cities under a thick blanket of snow. Some areas in the north-east saw more than 20in (50.8cm) of snow during a 24-hour period, according to the National Weather Service (NWS). Canadian officials also said the storm had seriously disrupted southern Ontario. In eastern Canada, snow is expected to continue in the Maritimes region on Tuesday, according to BBC Weather. Despite the storm easing away from the US, lake-effect snow showers are due to persist around the Great Lakes for the rest of the week. The coming days will remain very cold in central and eastern region of North America, and the situation is expected to intensify ahead of the weekend, when another significant winter storm could hit the eastern US. On Monday, more than 6,000 flights into, within or out of the US were cancelled, more than 7,000 were delayed, according to tracking website FlightAware. The severe weather also had a range of on-the-ground impacts, including in a number of southern US states. More than half a million users were without power in the early hours of Tuesday, according to PowerOutage.com. The worst-affected state is Tennessee, where the city of Nashville has experienced a deep freeze that plunged residents into cold and darkness. "There are many trees down and power lines blocking the roads," Joy Flores, vice president of the Nashville Rescue Mission homeless shelter, told the BBC. Her centre was taking calls from residents who had lost power. The roads were icy and impossible to navigate, Flores said, and her home had "no heating, no internet, and no coffee". In Texas, a teenage girl died and another was in critical condition due to a sledding accident, the Frisco Police Department announced. In North Carolina, a man was found dead on the side of a highway in Buncombe County and authorities are investigating whether his death was weather-related. Louisiana's department of health said that two people had died due to hypothermia. Further north, a total of eight people died in New York City between Friday and Monday morning as temperatures plummeted, according to city officials, . The city's Central Park had registered 11.4in of snow as of Monday morning. Other deaths have been reported in Massachusetts, Kansas, Pennsylvania. As of Monday evening, at least 20 deaths had been linked to the cold temperatures and heavy snowfall, although in some cases officials said it was too early to determine the exact cause. In Canada, Ottawa and Quebec saw the heaviest impacts from the storm, leading to transport issues and multiple school closures. Toronto Pearson Airport received 18in of snowfall on Sunday, a new record for the site, according to the CBC. Relief may not come soon. According to the NWS, the "potential is increasing" for another winter storm beginning on Friday. Such an event could bring very cold temperatures across the eastern US, and "widespread heavy precipitation". The US weather agency cautioned that forecasters did not yet know the potential path of the storm or where it would have the most impact. Additional reporting by Gabriela Pomeroy.
