Japan court orders compensation for migrants lured to North Korea A Tokyo court has asked Pyongyang to pay 88 million Japanese yen ($570,000; £416,000) to four people who were lured to North Korea decades ago by a propaganda scheme. The plaintiffs said the North was marketed to them as "paradise on Earth", but they instead found themselves subject to harsh conditions, including forced labour. They later escaped. Monday's ruling is largely symbolic with no real way to enforce it: North Korea has for years ignored the lawsuit, and its leader Kim Jong Un has not responded to Japanese court summons. But the ruling, which comes after a years-long legal battle in Japanese courts, has been hailed by the plaintiffs' lawyer as "historic". This was the first time "a Japanese court exercised its sovereignty against North Korea to recognise its malpractice", said Atsushi Shiraki, a lawyer representing the plaintiffs, AFP reported. More than 90,000 Zainichi Koreans - ethnic Koreans who live in Japan - moved to North Korea between 1959 and 1984, under a resettlement scheme which promised an idyllic life of free healthcare, education and jobs. But instead survivors say they found themselves forced to work on farms and factories, subject to restrictions and could not leave. One of the plaintiffs, Eiko Kawasaki, went to North Korea in 1960, when she was 17. She escaped in 2003 and is now 83 years old. She was among a group of five plaintiffs who filed a lawsuit in 2018 demanding compensation. Two of the original plaintiffs have since died, but one of them continued to be represented in the lawsuit by their family. In 2022, a Tokyo district court rejected their compensation claims, saying that it fell outside Japanese jurisdiction and the statute of limitations had expired. But in 2023, the Tokyo High Court ruled that the case was in fact under Japanese jurisdiction and found that North Korea had violated the plaintiffs' rights. "It's not an overstatement to say most of their lives were ruined by North Korea," judge Taiichi Kamino said at a ruling at the Tokyo District Court on Monday, according to an Associated Press report. Kenji Fukuda, another lawyer for the plaintiffs acknowledged the significance of the ruling but said it would be a "challenge" actually getting any money from North Korea.

### 2. [US to send ICE agents to Winter Olympics, prompting Italian anger](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y29xzjdzvo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

US to send ICE agents to Winter Olympics, prompting Italian anger The US immigration agency whose officers have been involved in two fatal shootings in Minneapolis has said it is sending agents to help support American security operations during the Winter Olympics, which start in Italy on 6 February. Confirmation of the agency's role came from the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), after reports prompted alarm and anger in Italy. "This is a militia that kills... of course they're not welcome in Milan," the city's mayor, Beppe Sala, told Italian radio on Tuesday. An ICE spokesperson stressed that "all security operations remain under Italian authority". US embassy sources in Rome had already explained to Italian media that various federal agencies had worked at previous Games in the past, although it was not clear if the customs and enforcement agency had itself taken part. The agency's statement on Tuesday explained that "ICE's Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) is supporting the US Department of State's Diplomatic Security Service and host nation to vet and mitigate risks from transnational criminal organisations". It would "obviously" not conduct immigration enforcement operations outside the US, it said. Italy's interior minister, Matteo Pantedosi, had initially appeared unaware that US immigration officials would be coming to the Milan-Cortina Olympics and said even if they were, foreign delegations could choose their own security, saying: "I don't see what the problem is and it's very normal." But as shock at the images emanating from Minneapolis grew, so did the outcry in Italy that officers from the same US federal agency could appear on Italian streets. In the aftermath of Alex Pretti being shot on the streets of Minneapolis by federal agents on Saturday morning, two journalists for Italian public broadcaster Rai were threatened by ICE officials as the reporters drove around the city covering the agency's actions. The Rai TV report showed one agent warned the crew that if they kept filming the agents, their car window would be smashed. The governor of Lombardy region, Attilio Fontana, sought to calm the situation, suggesting that ICE agents would be deployed in Italy to protect US Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Political opponents of right-wing Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, such as Five Star Senator Barbara Floridia, warned that continued government silence on the issue would provide "yet more evidence of cowardice and subservience towards Donald Trump". The interior minister has since taken a stronger stand, maintaining on Monday that "ICE will certainly not operate on Italian national territory". The US had not communicated a list of security personnel, and security was guaranteed by the Italian state, he said. The centre-left mayor of Milan was unimpressed. "I believe [ICE agents]shouldn't come to Italy because they don't guarantee they conform to our democratic way of ensuring security," Beppe Sala told RTL radio.

**Excerpt**

Sweden aims to lower age of criminal responsibility to 13 as gangs recruit children Sweden is moving forward with plans to lower the age of criminal responsibility from 15 to 13 in serious cases as it grapples with a growing number of children recruited into gangs to carry out violent crimes without facing serious legal repercussions. Justice Minister Gunnar Strommer said the country was in an "emergency situation" and stopping the use of children in criminal networks was a "crucial task" for the government. But several authorities, including police, prison officials and prosecutors, have opposed the plan, with some worried that it may lead to even younger children becoming offenders. If passed, the legislation will go into force as early as this summer. Strommer insisted that the proposal did not amount to a "general lowering of the age of criminal responsibility" and would only apply to the "most serious crimes" such as murder, attempted murder, aggravated bombings, aggravated weapons offences and aggravated rape. Under the proposal, some of these offenders could face prison sentences in certain cases. Data from the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention shows that the number of registered offences linked to suspects under the age of 15 has doubled over the past decade. The current government came into power in 2022 vowing to crack down on organised crime. At the beginning of last year, a government-ordered inquiry recommended lowering the age of criminal responsibility to 14 in serious cases. Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson confirmed in September that it would be lowered from 15, saying children are "being ruthlessly exploited by criminal networks to commit serious crimes". "Both to protect these children and their potential victims, the government is taking strong action against this type of cynical exploitation," he added. The government then announced that it would seek to lower it to 13, and sent out the bill for input from 126 authorities and organisations. Their plans were met with criticism and opposition from different authorities and organisations. In November, the police authority said that the change risked "significantly younger children" getting involved in criminal gangs as a result. Other groups said the prison system was not equipped to handle such young offenders and detaining them could breach children's rights. The prison and probation service also said the move could lead to negative consequences for children and that they should be cared for in "other ways". Ministers had also previously considered imposing age limits on social media, with police arguing that gangs had used certain platforms to recruit young children into crime. Strommer said on Monday that he had taken note of the previous criticism of the bill, but that the situation had become more urgent. However opposition has not abated. Fredrik Hjulström, a local authority head who is reviewing the proposal, said it contained "no factual arguments", according to Swedish national broadcaster SVT. He added that children should receive care rather than being punished and argued that the bill was about scoring political points, with the country's general election coming up in September this year. Meanwhile lawyer Johan Eriksson agreed that action must be taken to prevent children from being recruited by gangs, but said lowering the age of criminal responsibility would likely have the opposite effect. The bill will be sent to Sweden's Council on Legislation, which reviews bills the government intends to put before parliament.
