Immigration chief departing Minneapolis as Trump sends border tsar Tom Homan to scene A top US immigration official is expected to leave the US city of Minneapolis in what may mark a shift in the White House's tone after the fatal shooting of a second US citizen by federal officers over the weekend. As Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino and some immigration agents depart, "border tsar" Tom Homan will begin leading on-the-ground efforts in the Minnesota city after the shooting of Alex Pretti on Saturday escalated tensions. The decision by President Donald Trump may indicate the administration's interest in walking back more aggressive federal action in his nationwide immigration crackdown. Despite the announcement, online tracking of immigration raids shows the administration's efforts have still continued. Bovino was the face of the operation when Pretti - an observer seen filming agents - got into a confrontation that led to him being shot numerous times on a street in Minneapolis. The border control commander inflamed the situation on the ground in the aftermath of the shooting, claiming that Pretti intended to "massacre" federal agents. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said the agents fired in self-defence after Pretti, who they say had a handgun, resisted their attempts to disarm him on Saturday. Eyewitnesses, local officials and the victim's family have challenged that account, pointing out Pretti had a phone in his hand, not a weapon. His parents, meanwhile, have accused the administration of spreading "sickening lies" about what happened. Before the shooting, Bovino was key to the Trump administration's hard-line approach to immigration enforcement in several cities, active on social media and regularly filming raids and posting promotional videos showing his agents' action. Homan, who will report directly to the president, advocates for Trump's aggressive immigration enforcement. But he also has experience in the role - Homan worked with immigration and deportations during Democrat Barack Obama's administration. In Minneapolis on Monday, tension and frustration over the presence of federal officials remained high, despite the news that Bovino and some agents would be leaving. "A lot of people aren't able to work right now, they aren't able to leave their house, they're afraid," said George Cordero, a resident of St Paul, Minneapolis', sister city. Pretti was the second Minneapolis resident shot and killed by federal immigration officials since their arrival in the state; Renee Nicole Good, was killed by an Immigration and Customs Border Enforcement (ICE) agent on 7 January. Some media reports on Monday suggested Bovino had been let go from his role, but Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin refuted that, saying the border patrol chief "is a key part of the President's team and a great American". Much of the anger in the city and from politicians on both sides of the aisle was directed at Bovino and border patrol agents sent to Minneapolis along with ICE agents at Trump's directive. In total, there are more than 3,000 immigration agents in the city. Carol Engelheart, a retired nurse from Minneapolis, said she has been deeply emotional about the events of the past few days. "We need to care about this country, we need to care that we have a Constitution left, and if the people organize and the people stand up, we can do this," she said, as she chided immigration enforcement actions in the city. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Monday that it is the president's "hope and wish and demand for the resistance and chaos" in Minneapolis to end. Trump ally Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, called Trump's decision to send Homan, to Minneapolis "a very smart move". Also on Monday, Trump spoke will both Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey - democratic leaders who have resisted the immigration efforts and demanded agents be removed from the state. Trump has criticised both in recent weeks. Both Trump and the local leaders characterised the talks as positive and said they discussed a pathway forward - a sign that both sides were seeking a way to end their standoff over Trump's deportation drive. Trump said he and Walz are "on a similar wavelength" and said his target is "any and all criminals that they have in their possession". "The President agreed to look into reducing the number of federal agents in Minnesota and to talk to DHS about ensuring the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension is able to conduct an independent investigation, as would ordinarily be the case," Walz said after the call. Ensuring an independent investigation into Pretti's death, has been a central focus for Walz. In its immediate aftermath, local authorities obtained a judicial warrant to gain access to the crime scene to preserve evidence. Local officials have condemned the federal government investigation and said they were not being allowed to access the crime scene and evidence following Pretti's death. That response was predicated on the aftermath of Good's shooting, when local and state authorities said they were being kept out of the investigation by federal immigration officials. Utah Senator John Curtis, also a Republican, issued a statement calling for a "transparent, independent investigation into the Minnesota shooting". "Those responsible—no matter their title—must be held accountable," he said. Memorials for Pretti - a 37-year-old ICU nurse - and demonstrations against ICE action continued on Monday night, including one organized outside the hotel where Bovino was allegedly staying. A hundred or so protesters there gathered loudly and urged the border control commander to leave the city. More vigils and demonstrations are planned for the coming days. On Tuesday, Frey said he plans to meet with Homan to "discuss next steps" offering the first in-person meeting of federal and local officials since Bonvino's departure was announced.

Deadly US winter storm leaves flights delayed and thousands without power Several people have died in a winter storm that hit a wide swath of the US, causing thousands of flights to be cancelled or delayed due to conditions. The storm, which caused chaos from Texas to the tip of Maine over the weekend, snarled roadways, knocked out power, and buried major cities under a thick blanket of snow. At least a dozen people have been killed in several US states. Some areas in the northeast saw over 20 inches (50.8 cm) of snow in the last 24 hours, according to the National Weather Service (NWS), and Canadian officials said the storm has seriously disrupted southern Ontario. Forecasters warn another "significant winter storm" could hit the eastern US again this weekend. More than 200,000 people had lost power in Tennessee as of Monday afternoon. The city experienced a deep freeze that plunged residents into cold and darkness. "There are many trees down and power lines blocking the roads." Joy Flores, vice president of the Nashville Rescue Mission homeless shelter, told the BBC. Her centre was taking calls from residents who had lost power. The roads were icy and impossible to navigate, Flores said, and own her home had "no heating, no internet, and no coffee". In New York City, a total of eight people had died between Friday and Monday morning, according to city officials, as temperatures plummeted into the single digits. New York City's Central Park registered 11.4 inches of snow as of Monday morning, according to the NWS. In Texas, a teenage girl died and another was in critical condition due to a sledding accident, the Frisco Police Department announced. In North Carolina, a man was found dead on the side of a highway in Buncombe County and authorities are investigating whether his death was weather-related. And Louisiana's department of health said that two people had died due to hypothermia. Massachusetts Governor Maura Healy warned the state's residents on Monday that "it's not over yet", and one to five inches of snowfall was expected on Monday. In Canada, Ottawa and Quebec saw the heaviest impacts from the storm, leading to transportation issues and multiple school closures. Toronto Pearson Airport received 18.1 inches (46 cm) of snow fall on Sunday, a new record for the site, according to the CBC. On Monday, US airline customers continued to experience frustrations and delayed. Airlines experienced over 19,000 delays on Monday, according to FlightAware, and 5,900 cancellations. Relief may not come soon. According to the NWS, the "potential is increasing" for another winter storm beginning on Friday. Such an event could bring very cold temperatures across the eastern US, and "widespread heavy precipitation". The US weather agency cautioned that forecasters did not yet know the potential path of the storm or where it would have the most impact.

**Excerpt**

Trump raises US tariffs on South Korea imports to 25% US President Donald Trump has announced he is raising tariffs on South Korean imports to 25% after accusing Seoul of "not living up" to a trade deal reached last year. In a post on social media, Trump said he would increase levies on South Korea from 15% across a range of products including automobiles, lumber, pharmaceuticals and "all other Reciprocal TARIFFS". Trump said South Korean lawmakers have been slow to approve the deal while "we have acted swiftly to reduce our TARIFFS in line with the Transaction agreed to". South Korea says it had not been given official notice of the decision to raise tariffs on some of its goods, and wanted urgent talks with Washington over the issue. It added that South Korea's Industry Minister Kim Jung-kwan, who is currently in Canada, will visit Washington as soon as possible to meet US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. South Korea's benchmark Kospi stock index fell on Tuesday morning but was trading about 1.8% higher later in the day as shares in major exporters recovered. Seoul and Washington reached a deal last October, which included a pledge from South Korea to invest $350bn (£256bn) in the US, some of which would go to shipbuilding. The following month, the two countries agreed that the US would reduce tariffs on some products once South Korea started the process to approve the deal. The agreement was submitted to South Korea's National Assembly on 26 November and is currently being reviewed. It is likely to be passed in February, according to local media. Tariffs are paid by companies who import products. In this case, US firms will pay a 25% tax on goods they buy from South Korea. Trump has frequently used tariffs as leverage to enact foreign policy during his second term in the White House. On Saturday, he threatened Canada with a 100% tariff if it struck a trade deal with China. On Monday, Chinese officials said its "strategic partnership" agreement with Canada is not meant to undercut other countries. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has said his country was not pursuing a free trade deal with China and has "never" considered it. He added that Canadian officials have made their position clear to their American counterparts. Before that, Trump said he would impose import taxes on eight countries - including the UK - who opposed US plans to seize Greenland, an autonomous territory in the Kingdom of Denmark which is a member of Nato. He later backed down from the tariff threat over Greenland citing progress towards a "future deal" over the island, but the episode strained US relations with Denmark and other Nato allies.

**Excerpt**

Tech giants face landmark trial over social media addiction claims A landmark social media addiction trial in which top tech executives are expected to testify begins on Tuesday in California. The plaintiff, a 19-year-old woman identified by the initials KGM, alleges the design of the platforms' algorithms left her addicted to social media and negatively affected her mental health. The defendants include Meta - which owns Instagram and Facebook - TikTok's owner ByteDance and YouTube parent Google. Snapchat settled with the plaintiff last week. The closely-watched case at Los Angeles Superior Court is the first in a wave of such lawsuits, which could challenge a legal theory used by tech firms to shield themselves from culpability in the US. 'Dangerous and addictive algorithms' The named social media companies have said the plaintiff's evidence falls short of proving they are responsible for alleged harms such as depression and eating disorders. The case going to trial marks a distinct shift in how the US legal system treats tech firms, which face mounting claims that their products lead to addictive behaviours. The companies have long argued that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, passed by Congress in 1996, exempts platforms from liability for what third parties post. But at issue in this case are design choices about algorithms, notifications and other features that affect how people use their apps. KGM's attorney, Matthew Bergman, told the BBC the case will be the first time a social media company has been held to account by a jury at trial. "Unfortunately, there are all too many kids in the United States, the UK, and around the world who are suffering as KGM does because of the dangerous and addictive algorithms that the social media platforms foist on unsuspecting kids," he said. "These companies are going to have to explain to a jury why their profits were more important than the lives of our young people." Eric Goldman, a law professor at Santa Clara University, told the BBC that losing these cases in court could pose an existential threat to the social media companies. But he said it may be difficult for plaintiffs to prove physical harms can be blamed on content publishers. "The fact that the plaintiffs have been able to sell that idea has opened the door to a whole bunch of new legal questions that the law wasn't really designed to answer," he said. 'The tech industry has been given deferential treatment' At trial, jurors are expected to see an array of evidence, including excerpts from internal company documents. "A lot of what these companies have been trying to shield from the public is likely going to be aired in court," said Mary Graw Leary, a law professor at Catholic University of America. Meta previously said it introduced dozens of tools to support a safe environment for teens online, but some researchers have disputed the effectiveness of the recent measures. The companies are expected to argue any asserted harms are caused by third-party users. One highly-anticipated witness the jury will hear from is Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg, who is due to testify early in the trial. In 2024, he told US senators "the existing body of scientific work has not shown any causal link between social media and young people having worse mental health outcomes". During that same hearing, at the prodding of one senator, Zuckerberg apologised to victims and their loved ones who had crowded into the chamber. Tech executives "are often not good under pressure" said Mary Anne Franks, a law professor at George Washington University. She said the firms were "very much much hoping" they could avoid having top bosses testify. The trial comes as the companies face growing scrutiny from families, school districts, and prosecutors worldwide. Last year, dozens of US states sued Meta, alleging the company misled the public over risks of social media use and had contributed to a youth mental health crisis. Australia has enacted a social media ban on under-16s, and the UK signalled in January it may follow. "There is a tipping point when it comes to the harms of social media," Franks said. "The tech industry has been given deferential treatment - I think we're seeing that start to change."

**Excerpt**

Former Olympian Ryan Wedding pleads not guilty to drug kingpin charges Former Olympic snowboarder Ryan Wedding has pleaded not guilty to all 17 felony charges against him including drug trafficking, witness tampering and conspiracy to commit murder. In his first court appearance since being arrested in Mexico last week, Wedding appeared relaxed, smiling with his attorney and occasionally at the media and FBI agents as he stretched his unshackled arms. Wedding was on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list for allegedly running a transnational drug cartel, importing millions of dollars' worth of cocaine into Los Angeles and distributing it to Canada and across the US. He is also accused of orchestrating the murder of a man who planned to testify against him. US officials have alleged the 44-year-old was living in Mexico under the Sinaloa drug cartel's protection. Wedding, who wore a tan prison jumper over an orange shirt and socks, told Judge John Early on Monday that he had read the two indictments against him and understood his rights. His attorney did not request bail, but said they may do so at another date. A Canadian national who competed in snowboarding at the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City, Wedding still looks like an athlete – an imposing figure at 1.91m (6ft 3in) and 109 kg (240 pounds). Some journalists expressed surprise that his wrists were not shackled. US officials have not provided details of Wedding's arrest in Mexico, but his lawyer Anthony Colombo disputed reports from Mexican officials that Wedding had turned himself in. "That is a false narrative," Colombo told the BBC outside the courthouse. He appeared in court in Santa Ana in Orange County, instead of Los Angeles, as his appearance was moved due to ongoing protests outside the LA federal building against federal immigration operations. Wedding is next due in court in Los Angeles on 9 February. Previously described as a "modern-day iteration of Pablo Escobar" by FBI director Kash Patel, the agency says Wedding's aliases include "El Jefe," "Giant," "Public Enemy," "James Conrad King," and "Jesse King". Officials allege that he launched his criminal enterprise following his release from a US federal prison in 2011, where he was serving a sentence for cocaine distribution. He is alleged to have ordered dozens of murders across the globe, including in the US, Canada and Latin America. Officials say he had been living in luxury in Mexico as the search for him by both US and Canadian police ramped up. Late last year, the FBI released photos of Wedding's motorcycle collection they seized in Mexico, which they say is worth about $40m (£29m). In November, RCMP Commissioner Michael Duheme said seven Canadians allegedly linked to the cartel had been arrested and would be extradited to the US.

**Excerpt**

'Major step': French MPs vote in favour of bill to ban social media for under-15s France's National Assembly has backed a bill that would ban social media access for under-15s, a proposal supported by President Emmanuel Macron. Lawmakers in the lower house on Monday agreed key elements of the bill, before voting 116-23 in its favour. Next, the bill will go to the upper house, the Senate, for approval. If it is passed, young teenagers would not be able to use networks such as Snapchat, Instagram and TikTok. The French move is part of a growing trend of restricting social networks for children, triggered by increasing evidence of the damage they can cause to mental health. A similar law was passed in Australia late last year. After the National Assembly passed the bill in an overnight session from Monday to Tuesday, Macron called it a "major step". Writing on social media, he called for the government to accelerate the next steps, "so that this ban takes effect as early as next school year". The new school year begins on 1 September in France. "Our children's brains are not for sale," he wrote. Laure Miller, an MP behind the bill, told Le Monde: "With this law we will set down a clear limit in society." "We are saying something very simple: social networks are not harmless," she added. "These networks promised to bring people together. They pulled them apart. They promised to inform. They saturated us with information. They promised to entertain. They shut people away." Last month, Macron said: "We cannot leave the mental and emotional health of our children in the hands of people whose sole purpose is to make money out of them." Under the new text, the state media regulator would draw up a list of social media networks that are deemed harmful. These would be simply banned for under 15-year-olds. A separate list of supposedly less harmful sites would be accessible, but only with explicit parental approval. Another clause would ban the use of mobile telephones in senior schools (lycées). The ban is already in effect in junior and middle schools. If the law is passed, France will need to agree on the mechanism for age-verification. A system is already in place that requires over 18 year-olds to prove their age when accessing online pornography. In Europe, Denmark, Greece, Spain and Ireland are also considering following the Australian example. Earlier this month, the UK government launched a consultation on banning social media for under 16s. The basis of the proposed French law is a text drawn up late last year by Miller, who chaired a parliamentary committee enquiry into the psychological effects of TikTok and other networks. Separately, the government was told to draw up its own legislation, after Macron decided to make the issue a centrepiece of his last year in office. The president has been sidelined from domestic politics since the Assembly elections which he called in 2024 resulted in a hung parliament. The social media ban has been a rare chance to court public favour. For a time the cause risked falling victim to bickering between Macron and his one-time prime minister Gabriel Attal (Miller is an MP from Attal's party). But in the end the government appears to have rallied behind the Miller bill. The bill is expected to pass before the upper house, the Senate, in the next month. Macron said he had asked the government of Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu to use a fast-track procedure to get the legislation on the books by September. Without resort to the fast-track (which permits a single reading as opposed to two in each of the two houses), the law would have little chance of getting past the legislative backlog created by Lecornu's difficulties in passing a budget. The bill has already had to be redrafted to take account of questions raised by the Council of State, the body which previews draft legislation to ensure it conforms with French and European law. A 2023 law which proposed a similar ban on social media for young teenagers proved inoperable after courts decided it broke European law.

Nigerian officers to face trial over coup-plot allegations A group of officers in Nigeria are set to face a military court after being accused of "plotting to overthrow the government" of President Bola Tinubu last year, an armed forces' statement has said. Sixteen officers were arrested last October after what were described as "acts of indiscipline and breaches of service regulations". At the time the military dismissed rumours of an attempted coup, but following an investigation, the authorities have acknowledged that some of the 16 will go before a military judicial panel. Nigeria has a complex history of military involvement in politics, with multiple coups between 1966 and 1993, which has made allegations of coup‑plotting highly sensitive. It is not clear how many of the 16 will go on trial, but the military authorities said the process would ensure accountability and uphold "the principles of fairness and due process". A statement added that trying to unseat the elected government was "inconsistent with the ethics, values and professional standards" of the military. In recent years, concerns over instability, insecurity and public frustration have occasionally prompted rumours about dissent within the ranks - rumours the military has repeatedly dismissed. Nigeria has experienced a period of unbroken civilian rule since 1999. The armed forces have consistently stressed their loyalty to civilian authority, often issuing public statements reaffirming their commitment to democracy. This latest development comes at a time when the West African region has experienced a resurgence of coups. Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger and Guinea have all seen their governments toppled by soldiers since the beginning of the decade. However, Guinea recently returned to a democratic rule with the junta leader, Mamadi Doumbouya elected president. These events have created heightened vigilance among governments in the region, including Nigeria, which has traditionally positioned itself as a stabilising force within the regional grouping Ecowas. Within Nigeria, the military continues to face intense operational pressures - from fighting militant jihadist groups in the north-east to tackling criminals and communal violence across the north‑west and central states. Analysts say such pressures, combined with resource constraints and public scrutiny, have put the spotlight on discipline within the armed forces.

### 9. [China has purged its highest-ranked military general. Why?](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8d0l0g8yz5o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

China has purged its highest-ranked military general. Why? The senior ranks of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) are in tatters. The weekend purging of China's top general, Zhang Youxia, and another senior military officer, Gen Liu Zhenli, has left serious questions about what triggered the elite power struggles unfolding in the country - and what this means for China's warfighting capacity, whether it be any ambition to take Taiwan by force or engage in another major regional conflict. Zhang, 75, was vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC) - the Communist Party group headed by the country's leader Xi Jinping, which controls the armed forces. The CMC, usually made up of around seven people, has now been whittled down to just two members - Xi and Gen Zhang Shengmin. All others have been taken down in the "anti-corruption" crackdown following previous waves of detention. The CMC is responsible for controlling millions of military personnel. It is so powerful that being chairman of this body was the single position held by Deng Xiaoping as absolute ruler of China. That only Xi and one CMC general remain is unprecedented, according to Lyle Morris from the Asia Society Policy Institute. "The PLA is in disarray," he told the BBC, adding that China's military now had "a major leadership void". Asked what was really driving the culling of so many top generals, he said: "There are a lot of rumours floating around. We don't know, at this point, what is true and what is false… but it is certainly bad for Xi Jinping, for his leadership and control over the PLA." Associate Professor Chong Ja Ian from the National University of Singapore also said he was not sure what the real reason was for Zhang's downfall but that there was a lot of speculation about it. "Everything from leaking nuclear secrets to the United States to plotting a coup and factional infighting. There are even rumours of a gunfight in Beijing," he said. "But Zhang and Liu's downfall along with the wild speculation highlight two things: that Xi remains unassailable and there are significant limits to information in Beijing which fuels uncertainty and feeds this speculation." The official announcement that Zhang and Liu were "under investigation" said that they were accused of "serious violations of discipline and law", which is a euphemism for corruption. Then the PLA Daily made this absolutely clear in an editorial, writing that this move showed the Communist Party's "zero tolerance" approach to "punishing corruption… no matter who it is or how high their position". The specific allegations being made against all of these generals have not been released to the public and may never be. However, that they have been named as under investigation almost certainly means being given a custodial sentence as a minimum. The PLA Daily editorial was already speaking of Zhang and Liu as if they were guilty, saying they had "seriously betrayed the trust and expectations of the Communist Party's Central Committee" as well as "trampling on and undermining the Central Military Commission". The targeting of the generals may be about corruption, but it may also be about power politics, given how these purges have panned out in the past. China definitely had a corruption problem when Xi Jinping came to power, but its leader has also been accused of using his anti-corruption drive, deploying the Party's feared discipline inspection teams, to take out would-be political rivals or those in government ranks showing anything short of full loyalty to him. This has given General Secretary Xi a level of unchallenged control not seen since Chairman Mao. Yet this type of leadership can also be counterproductive. In the military, for example, a climate of suspicion can lead to cautious – even weak – decision making. Zhang's father was a revolutionary comrade of Xi's father. The general goes back a long way with Xi and that they were seen as close allies before the turmoil of recent days has possibly made this worse because of a belief that no-one is safe. He was also one of only a handful of senior officers in the PLA with combat experience, making his loss significant for the military. His removal also poses longer term problems for Xi, according to Morris. Xi may have stamped his authority, yet again, but the upheaval means ongoing frictions, he said. "It's certainly a bad look for Xi and I think there's going to be significant turmoil in the PLA, with Xi and his leaders – especially in the PLA – for years to come." The purging of the most senior generals also brings scrutiny on the next layer of officers who may be wondering who is next? Given the fate of those above they also may not welcome promotion into the deadly zone where Xi's anti-corruption spotlight can be trained on you at any time. And all this has come at a time when Beijing is increasing pressure on Taiwan with threats to, at some point, seize the self-governing island via an all-out attack. Analysts will be weighing up just how much these removals have hampered such a possibility - though some think it will have little impact on curbing Beijing's ambitions. "The purge does not affect the PRC's ambitions to control Taiwan. That comes down to the CCP as a whole and Xi specifically," said Chong. "Where the purge may matter are operational decisions. Without top military professionals or military professionals who are cowed, decisions about escalation and aggression toward Taiwan will centre even more on Xi, his preferences, and proclivities."
