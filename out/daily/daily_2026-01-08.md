Vance criticises Denmark and Europe's handling of 'critical' Greenland US Vice-President JD Vance says Greenland is "critical" for the defence of the US and the world against possible Russian or Chinese missile attacks - and that Europe and Denmark have "not done a good job" in securing the area. Vance told Fox News that they had not only under-invested in Greenland's defences, but also failed to engage with President Donald Trump's argument over the issue. US officials are "actively" discussing a potential offer to buy Greenland - a semi-autonomous Danish territory - the White House said on Wednesday, a day after suggesting military action to annex it to the US was also an option. Denmark, a fellow Nato member, has warned this would spell the end of the alliance. Both Greenland and Denmark have repeatedly stressed the island is not for sale. Despite being the most sparsely populated territory, Greenland's location between North America and the Arctic makes it well placed for early warning systems in the event of missile attacks, and for monitoring vessels in the region. Pituffik Space Base, formerly known as Thule Air Base, has been operated by the US since World War Two. In recent years, there has also been increased interest in Greenland's natural resources - including rare earth minerals, uranium and iron - which are becoming easier to access as its ice melts due to climate change. Scientists think it could also have significant oil and gas reserves. "People do not realise that the entire missile defence infrastructure is partially dependent on Greenland," Vance said in his interview on Wednesday. "If God forbid the Russians and the Chinese - not saying they're going to - but if, God forbid, somebody launched a nuclear missile into our continent, they launched a nuclear missile at Europe, Greenland is a critical part of that missile defence. "So you ask yourself, 'have the Europeans, have the Danes done a proper job of securing Greenland and of making sure it can continue to serve as an anchor for world security and missile defence?' And the answer is obviously they haven't," he said. Concerns over the future of the territory resurfaced after Trump's use of military force against Venezuela on Saturday to seize its President Nicolás Maduro. Trump previously made an offer to buy the island in 2019, during his first presidential term, only to be told it was not for sale. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Wednesday that he would hold talks with Denmark next week. A day earlier, European leaders issued a joint statement rallying behind Denmark. "Greenland belongs to its people, and only Denmark and Greenland can decide on matters concerning their relations," the leaders of France, the UK, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain and Denmark said in a joint statement. Stressing they were as keen as the US on Arctic security, the European signatories said this must be achieved by Nato allies, including the US, "collectively". They also called for "upholding the principles of the UN Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders". Aaja Chemnitz, one of two MPs in the Danish parliament representing Greenland, told the BBC that the comments from the Trump administration were "a clear threat". "It's completely disrespectful from the US side to not rule out annexing our country and to annex another Nato ally," she said. But Chemnitz said she saw this as unlikely and that instead, "what we are going to see is that they will put pressure on us in order to make sure that they will take over Greenland over time". Aleqatsiaq Peary, a 42-year-old Inuit hunter living in Greenland's remote northerly town of Qaanaaq, appeared indifferent to the potential of US ownership. "It would be switching from one master to another, from one occupier to another," he told the BBC. "We are a colony under Denmark. We are already losing a lot from being under the Danish government." Saying that he did not have "time for Trump", he added that people were "in need". Hunters like him, he explained, hunted with dogs on the sea ice and fish "but the sea ice is melting and hunters cannot make a living anymore". Additional reporting by Adrienne Murray in Copenhagen

Influential China church reports arrests as crackdown on Christians intensifies An influential Protestant church in China says prominent leaders were arrested in what appears to be a growing crackdown on the underground church movement. Nine people were detained on Tuesday after police raided their homes and the church office in Chengdu, the Early Rain Covenant Church said. Five of them had been released by Wednesday. More than 1,000 miles away in Wenzhou, authorities began demolishing the Yayang Church building, as seen in video obtained by the non-profit ChinaAid, which monitors religious persecution. This latest wave of arrests, after others last year, shows the Communist Party's resolve to snuff out churches that do not align with its ideology, Christian groups say. The BBC has contacted China's embassy in the UK for comment. Authorities have not made any statements about the arrests, or the demolition in Wenzhou. China promotes atheism and controls religion. The government said in 2018 there are 44 million Christians in the country, but it's unclear if that number includes those who attend the many underground churches. The Party has long pressured Christians to join only state-sanctioned churches led by government-approved pastors. But Christian groups say the grip has tightened noticeably, with arrests becoming more common and prompt. At least two church leaders in China have told the BBC that authorities are swiftly arresting unauthorised church leaders, while in the past, these individuals would first be warned, then fined and finally detained if they still refuse to comply with orders. Just weeks ago, Li Yingqiang, the current leader of Early Rain Covenant Church, had said he "sensed a storm gathering" and referred to "the imminent prospect of... another large-scale crackdown". "I dearly hope that none of our families shall ever again endure such a storm. Yet as an elder appointed by the Lord to stand among you... it is my duty to remind you all to prepare yourselves before the storm returns," he wrote in a letter to church members in November. Li and his wife Zhang Xinyue are among the four who remain in detention. Their church described the arrests as a "concerted operation" but said the grounds for arrest, and whether those detained have been charged, remain unclear. It added that it had lost contact with two other members but did not say they had been detained. "The situation is ongoing, with specific details yet to be fully confirmed," Early Rain Covenant Church (ERCC) said in a statement to members and supporters. It also also sought prayers for its members' safety and their perseverance in the Christian faith. In Wenzhou, local authorities brought in bulldozers, cranes and heavy machinery earlier this week, and started taking down part of the Yayang Church building, as seen in the video. ChinaAid said it was told by multiple sources that hundreds of armed and special police officers have been deployed to stand guard outside the building. Sometimes known as "the Jerusalem of China", Wenzhou has more Christians than any other city in the country. Residents living near Yayang Church have been "driven away", while those working in the area has been instructed not to take photographs or record video, ChinaAid said. "The massive mobilisation against the two major independent church networks shows the central government is determined to stamp out Christian churches entirely, unless the church is totally indoctrinated into the party's ideology," said Bob Fu, who founded ChinaAid. In December, authorities arrested about 100 members of Yayang Church in Wenzhou over five days. At least 24 members remain in custody, according to Human Rights Watch. And in October last year 30 leaders of Zion Church, one of China's biggest underground churches, were rounded up across seven cities. Founder Ezra Jin is still in custody. The Chinese government has also targeted the Early Rain Covenant Church, founded in 2008, for years. In 2018, authorities raided the church and arrested founding pastor Wang Yi and his wife Jiang Rong. At least 100 church members were taken into custody in the following days in one of China's largest crackdowns on churches in the past decade. Wang, an outspoken critic of the Communist Party's policies on religion, was jailed for "inciting subversion of state power" and "illegal business operations". He is due to be released in 2027. The church has continued to gather online and sometimes replays Wang's recorded sermons to its members. "Xi Jinping's government has tightened ideological control and intensified its intolerance of loyalties beyond the Chinese Communist Party," said Yalkun Uluyol, China researcher at Human Rights Watch. "Concerned governments and religious leaders around the world should press the Chinese government to free detained religious adherents and respect religious freedom in China," Uluyol added. Under Xi, China has increased its control on religious freedom. Since 2015, he has called for the "Sinicisation of religions" which requires religious doctrines and practices to conform with Chinese culture and values. Last year, authorities banned clergy of all religions from preaching live on social media, organising online activities for children, and raising funds online, unless these are carried out on government-approved platforms.

**Excerpt**

US involvement in Venezuela could last years, Trump says US President Donald Trump has said that his country's involvement in Venezuela could last for years. He told the New York Times that "only time will tell" how long his administration would "oversee" the running of the South American nation following the seizure by US forces of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro in a raid on Saturday. Trump also did not say if or when elections would be held in Venezuela to replace the interim government headed by Maduro loyalist Delcy Rodríguez. Meanwhile, Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado said the ouster of Maduro had set off an "irreversible process" that would lead Venezuela to be "free". New York Times (NYT) journalists quizzed Trump on his plans for the future of Venezuela days after he had said his administration would run the oil-rich nation. Earlier on Wednesday, the White House had said that the US would control sales of sanctioned oil "indefinitely". US Energy Secretary Chris Wright argued that the US needed control over Venezuela's oil sales for leverage over the interim government in Caracas. Trump said his administration would be "taking oil" from Venezuela, which has the world's largest proven reserves, but acknowledged it would "take a while" to get the country's oil industry up and running. Venezuela's oil production has plummeted as a result of mismanagement on the part of the Maduro government and that of his predecessor, as well as years of US sanctions. Trump told the NYT that US Secretary of State Marco Rubio was "in constant communication" with Rodríguez, who was designated as Venezuela's interim leader by the country's Supreme Court, which is dominated by Maduro loyalists. He added that Rodríguez is "giving us everything that we feel is necessary." The US president had earlier said that the interim government had agreed to use the proceeds from the sale of its oil to buy only US-made goods. According to the NYT reporters, Trump did not answer their questions about why he recognised Rodríguez as Venezuela's new leader. Many Venezuela analysts had expected that the ouster of Maduro would be followed swiftly by the return to the country of opposition leaders Edmundo González and María Corina Machado. But in his first news conference following the US raid, Trump was dismissive about Machado, alleging that she lacked the "respect" and support to lead Venezuela. "I think it would be very tough for her to be the leader," he said. Machado managed to unite opposition groups behind her ahead of the 2024 presidential election but was barred from running for the presidency by officials loyal to the Maduro government. She then threw her weight behind former diplomat González, who acted as her proxy. The electoral council, which is also dominated by government loyalists, declared Maduro re-elected. However, voting tallies collected by the opposition, which have been independently verified, suggest González won by a landslide. González went into exile to escape the government repression that followed the election, and Machado went into hiding within Venezuela. She embarked on a perilous journey by land, sea and air to reach Oslo in December to collect the Nobel Peace Prize she was awarded for her "tireless work promoting democratic rights" in Venezuela. Her current whereabouts are unknown but she has said that she plans to return to Venezuela soon. In an interview with Venezuelan opposition news site La Patilla, she insisted that the ousting of Maduro had set her country on an irreversible path towards freedom. She said that she hoped this new phase of the transition process would be "as short and swift as possible". She added that the interim government, which she said was "the same regime it was under Maduro" was "being given instructions to dismantle itself". Machado insisted that González was the legitimate president-elect and urged that his mandate be respected. She stressed that "the first thing" that needed to happen was for the political prisoners to be released. Machado is not the only one who has been demanding that the more than 800 political prisoners held in Venezuela's notorious jails be freed. On Wednesday, Republican lawmaker María Elvira Salazar published several posts on social media insisting they be released "immediately". However, in his interview with the NYT, Trump instead "appeared far more focused on the rescue mission than the details of how to navigate Venezuela's future", according to the journalists who spoke to him. Pressed on what the US plans for Venezuela are, he said that "we will rebuild it in a very profitable way". He added: "We're going to be using oil, and we're going to be taking oil. We're getting oil prices down, and we're going to be giving money to Venezuela, which they desperately need." The US president is expected to meet representatives of three of the largest US oil companies at the White House on Friday to discuss those plans further.

Saudi-led coalition says UAE helped smuggle separatist leader out of Yemen The Saudi-led coalition in Yemen has alleged the United Arab Emirates helped smuggle a separatist leader out of the country after he was expelled from Yemen's presidential council and accused of treason. A coalition spokesman said Aidarous al-Zubaidi, head of the UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council (STC), fled Aden on Tuesday night in a boat to Somaliland. He was then flown by a cargo aircraft to Abu Dhabi via Mogadishu under the supervision of UAE officers, he added. There was no immediate comment from the UAE or STC. The STC insisted Zubaidi was still working from Aden on Wednesday, after the coalition said he had failed to fly to Riyadh for talks and had fled to an unknown location. The coalition also accused Zubaidi of moving STC forces from bases in Aden to his home province of al-Dahle and said it had carried out air strikes on them in response. The STC said the strikes, which reportedly killed four people, were "unjustified" and "inconsistent" with calls for dialogue with Yemen's internationally recognised government, which is overseen by the presidential council and backed by Saudi Arabia. On Thursday, coalition spokesman Maj Gen Turki al-Malki said it had "reliable intelligence" showing Zubaidi and his associates fled from Aden's port in the early hours of Wednesday on board a St Kitts and Nevis-flagged passenger ship. The vessel sailed across the Gulf of Aden to Berbera in the breakaway region of Somaliland, where a Ilyushin Il-76 cargo aircraft was waiting, he added. Malki said Zubaidi and his associates "boarded the aircraft under the supervision of UAE officers" and flew first to Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, before heading towards the Arabian Sea "without a declared destination". "The aircraft disabled its identification systems over the Gulf of Oman, reactivating them only 10 minutes prior to landing at Al-Reef Military Air Base in Abu Dhabi," he added, without saying directly whether Zubaidi was still on board. The past few weeks have seen southern Yemen moving to the brink of a new conflict, pitting factions battling the Iran-backed Houthi movement in the country's decade-long civil war against each other and deepening a rift between Saudi Arabia and the UAE. STC-aligned forces have in recent years taken control of much of the south, which they want once again to be an independent state, by pushing out forces loyal to the government. However, Saudi Arabia warned last week that the advances near the kingdom's borders constituted threats to its national security as well as the security and stability of Yemen. It also accused the UAE of "pressuring" its separatist allies to push into eastern Yemen and expressed support for a demand from the presidential council for all Emirati forces to leave. At the same time, the Saudi-led coalition - which was formed in 2015 by Arab states, including the UAE, after Houthi rebels seized control of north-western Yemen - struck what it said was a shipment of weapons and military vehicles for the STC that had arrived from the UAE. The UAE expressed "deep regret" at the Saudi accusations and denied there were any weapons, but agreed to pull its remaining forces out of the country. Since then, forces loyal to the government have retaken control of Hadramawt and al-Mahra with the help of coalition air strikes. Witnesses and government officials told Reuters news agency on Thursday that Aden was also now coming under the control of Saudi-backed forces.

**Excerpt**

US halts assistance to Somalia over claims food aid was illegally seized The US has suspended all assistance to the government of Somalia, alleging that officials destroyed a UN World Food Programme (WFP) warehouse and seized "donor-funded food aid". "The Trump administration has a zero-tolerance policy for waste, theft, and diversion of life-saving assistance," said a US state department statement on X. The message, posted on the account of the under secretary for foreign assistance, said reports had been received about officials illegally seizing 76 tonnes of food intended for "vulnerable Somalis". Any resumption of assistance would depend on the Somali government "taking accountability for its unacceptable actions and taking appropriate remedial steps", it said. Although the US has withdrawn from several UN organisations under President Donald Trump, it remains by far the largest contributor to the WFP, paying $2bn (£1.5bn) in 2025 - almost a third of its total funding. The Somali government, which has long been battling al-Qaeda-linked Islamist militants as it tries to rebuild the country after a devastating civil war and years of drought, has yet to comment. This is the latest example of the deteriorating relations between Washington and Mogadishu. Last month, Trump lashed out at Somali migrants living in the US, telling reporters they should "go back to where they came from" and "their country is no good for a reason". Communities have been targeted in immigration raids as the government alleges large-scale benefit fraud in Minnesota, the US state with the largest Somali community in the US. The recent recognition by US ally Israel of the breakaway republic of Somaliland, which Somalia considers to be part of its territory, has further angered Mogadishu. The aid that was allegedly seized by Somali officials was meant to help people cope with the effects of "drought, floods, conflict, high food prices and dwindling harvests", according to the WFP. It quotes figures saying that 4.6 million people in Somalia are facing crisis levels of hunger. You may also be interested in: Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

**Excerpt**

Children in Gaza return to school after years without formal education In Gaza City, the sound of children learning can be heard once again. The tents that now serve as classrooms are noisy and a little chaotic but lively. Some teachers point to boards covered in English letters; others invite pupils to come forward and write basic Arabic words. It is nowhere near a normal school day. But after the Israel-Hamas ceasefire in October, it's a start. After two years of war, the hum of lessons and chatter of classmates resonates around the ruins of what was once Lulwa Abdel Wahab al-Qatami School, in the Tel al-Hawa neighbourhood in the south-western part of Gaza City. It was hit in January 2024, and for months afterwards, its grounds served as a shelter for displaced families. Today, it is again a place of learning - albeit in a more basic form. Walking in a straight line, their small arms resting on each other's shoulders, pupils smile as they head into the makeshift classrooms. For many, this is the first return to routine and education since the war began. According to Unicef, more than 97% of schools in Gaza were damaged or destroyed during the war. The IDF has made repeated claims that Hamas uses civilian infrastructure including schools to carry out operations but has rarely provided solid evidence. Of the Strip's 658,000 school-aged children, most have had no formal education for nearly two years. During that time, many learned first-hand how hunger, displacement and death can shape their young lives. Now, something rare is emerging: a fragile glimpse of the childhoods they once knew. Fourteen-year-old Naeem al-Asmaar used to attend this school before it was destroyed. He lost his mother in an Israeli air strike during the war. "It was the hardest thing I've ever been through," he says quietly. Although he was displaced for months, Naeem's home in Gaza City survived. After the ceasefire, he returned with his family. "I missed being in school a lot," Naeem said adding that the difference is stark. "Before the war, school was in real classrooms," "Now it's tents. We only study four subjects. There isn't enough space. The education is not the same - but being here matters. School fills all my time and I really needed that." Rital Alaa Harb, a ninth-grade student who once studied here too, wants to become a dentist. "Displacement affected my education completely," she says. "There was no time to study. No schools. I missed my friends so much - and I miss my old school." The makeshift school is run by Unicef and brings together children from the original Lulwa school and others displaced by the war. It does not teach the full Palestinian curriculum - only the basics: Arabic, English, mathematics and science. The principal, Dr Mohammed Saeed Schheiber, has worked in education for 24 years. He took over management of the site in mid-November. "We started with determination," he said, "to compensate students for what they lost." The school currently serves 1,100 boys and girls, operating in three shifts a day - with boys attending on alternating days from girls. There are just 24 teachers. "Before the war," Dr Schheiber says, "our students learned in fully equipped schools - science labs, computer labs, internet access, educational resources. All of that is gone." There is no electricity here. No internet. And many children are struggling with trauma. More than 100 students at the school lost one or both parents, had their homes destroyed, or witnessed killings during the war. In total, Dr Schheiber says, every student has been affected - directly or indirectly. A counsellor now runs psychological support sessions, trying to help children process what they have endured. Despite the effort, demand far exceeds capacity. "We have more than a thousand students here already," Dr Schheiber says. "But only six classrooms per shift. There is a large displacement camp next to the school - families from northern and eastern Gaza. Many children want to enrol. We simply cannot take them." For parents, the return to school brings relief as well as anxiety. Huda Bassam al-Dasouki, a mother of five displaced from southern Rimal, says education has become an overwhelming challenge. "It's not that education doesn't exist," she says. "It's that it's extremely difficult." Even before the war, schools struggled with shortages, she says. Now, basic supplies are unaffordable or unavailable. "A notebook that cost one shekel ($0.31; £0.23) before the war now costs five," she says. "I have five children." Some children, she says, have fallen four years behind, including time lost during the Covid pandemic. "My son can't read. He can't write. He doesn't know how to copy from the board," she says. Unicef says the situation is made worse by restrictions on aid supplies entering Gaza. Standing outside one of the school tents, Jonathan Crickx, a Unicef spokesman, points to what is missing. "Paper, notebooks, pens, erasers, rulers... we've been asking for a long time that these supplies can enter the Gaza Strip and they haven't been allowed in. It's the same for mental health and psychosocial recreative kits - toy kits that can be used to do mental health activities and recreational activities with the children," he says. An Israeli security official referred us to the prime minister's office, which did not respond to the BBC's questions. Israel says it is meeting its obligations under the ceasefire deal with Hamas and facilitating increased aid deliveries. The UN and multiple aid agencies dispute that, accusing Israel of continuing to restrict access to essential supplies. Despite the ceasefire, Israel's bombardment of Gaza continues - with almost daily strikes - in response to what it says are Hamas violations of the deal. Still, the children keep coming. For Kholoud Habib, a teacher at the school, that determination is telling. "Education is our foundation," she says. "As Palestinians, it is our capital. "We lose homes. We lose money. We lose everything," she adds. "But knowledge - knowledge is the one investment we can still give our children."

One million without heat and water after Russian strikes, Ukraine says Russian drone strikes on Ukraine have left more than one million people in the region of Dnipropetrovsk without heating and water supplies, Ukraine's deputy prime minister says. Oleksiy Kuleba added that work was continuing to restore services following the large-scale attack, which damaged infrastructure across the south-east. Electricity supplies were also disrupted for thousands more people in neighbouring Zaporizhzhia, but power has since been restored. Russia has recently intensified attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, aimed at paralysing power supplies during a harsh winter. President Volodymyr Zelensky accused it of "mockery" and pleaded for Western support. Hospitals, water facilities and other critical services in Dnipropetrovsk were operating on backup systems, the energy ministry said, while residents were urged to limit electricity use to avoid further strain on the grid. DTEK, Ukraine's biggest private energy provider, is living in permanent crisis mode because of Russian attacks on the grid, its chief executive told the BBC last month, with most of Ukraine suffering from lengthy power cuts during winter. Maxim Timchenko, CEO of DTEK, which provides power for 5.6 million Ukrainians, said the intensity of strikes had been so frequent "we just don't have time to recover". As the fourth anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion approaches, Timchenko said Russia had repeatedly targeted DTEK's energy grid with "waves of drones, cruise and ballistic missiles" and his company had found it difficult to cope. "There is no military sense in such strikes on the energy sector, on infrastructure, which leave people without electricity and heating in winter conditions," Zelensky said. He urged Ukrainians to remain "resilient" against Russia's attempts "to break Ukraine" and added that peace talks aimed at ending the war should not be a reason to slow down Western supplies for Ukraine's air defences. Zelensky has been on a diplomatic tour this week - meeting allies in the "Coalition of the Willing" and US President Donald Trump's peace envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner. Following those talks in Paris on Tuesday, the UK and France signed a declaration of intent on deploying troops in Ukraine if a peace deal is reached - a move Moscow warned would make foreign forces a "legitimate target". But a day later, Zelensky said European allies had not given him sound guarantees that they would protect his country in the event of new Russian aggression. However, he also said he believed Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine could be brought to an end in the first half of 2026. Speaking at the opening of Cyprus's presidency of the EU for the next six months, he said negotiations with European partners and the US had entered a new stage and stressed that the EU should play a central role in any settlement. President Donald Trump has been leading efforts to bring the war to an end. His proposals - amended by Ukraine and its European allies - envisage Ukrainian territorial concessions to Russia in areas it does not already control in the country's east. Negotiations centre on those points - the last 10% of the deal, according to Zelensky. So far, Ukraine has refused to agree to cede territory to Russia. Once agreed, those proposals would need Russia's approval. Russian President Vladimir Putin has shown no sign of backing down for his demands to annex the entire territory of the industrial eastern region of Donbas. His troops have been making slow progress in the past few months.

Heatwave hits Australia as officials warn of 'catastrophic' fire risk Parts of Australia will face catastrophic fire conditions on Friday, when heatwaves are expected to hit most of the country. Severe to extreme heatwaves have been declared in every state and territory in Australia, except for Queensland, with high temperatures forecast for days. The state of Victoria has declared a total fire ban for Friday, as the fire danger rating will be set at "catastrophic" - the highest level. Some 450 schools and childcare centres will be closed. One meteorologist told the BBC that the combination of heatwaves and an elevated fire danger in parts of the country could create the most "significant" conditions since the devastating Black Summer bushfires. On Thursday, firefighters battled several blazes in Victoria and New South Wales (NSW), with a dozen planes carrying water called in to tackle a large fire near the city of Wodonga, the ABC reported. Melbourne experienced its hottest day in six years on Wednesday with a high of 40.9C (105.6F), while some coastal towns in Western Australia hit 49C. In NSW, the heatwave is expected to peak on Saturday with Sydney facing a high of 42C while areas of South Australia and Western Australia will see temperatures over 40C in the coming days. Friday will be the "real peak of the current burst of heat," Angus Hines from the Bureau of Meteorology told the BBC. "It will be a very hot day for almost all of South Australia, Victoria, most of New South Wales, parts of Tasmania". Wednesday was the first significant heatwave for Melbourne and Adelaide, where millions of people live, with fire conditions set to worsen on Friday, he said. "Firstly, the winds are strengthening across Victoria tomorrow," Hines said, adding that coupled with possible thunderstorms with little rain and dry lightning strikes, the fire danger will hit catastrophic levels for the northern parts of Victoria. "This looks like the most significant event at a multi-day level for inland south-east Australia since 2019-2020," Hines said. That period six years ago saw Australia's most severe fire season on record, the so-called Black Summer where dozens of people died and tens of millions of hectares of land was burnt. In Victoria, authorities on Thursday warned that a catastrophic fire danger rating means potential blazes can be "unpredictable and uncontrollable". "We need the community to play their role alongside our emergency services to protect lives and property," said Victoria's Emergency Management Commissioner Tim Wiebusch. "Prepare now and enact your bushfire survival plan. If you are in an area of forecast catastrophic fire danger, leave early to an area with a lower fire risk." Australia's fire danger ratings scale has four levels, with catastrophic being the highest level, followed by extreme, high and moderate. A heatwave is declared when the minimum and maximum temperatures are expected to be unusually high for three days of more.

US seizes two 'shadow fleet' tankers linked to Venezuelan oil The United States says it has seized two tankers linked to Venezuelan oil exports in "back-to-back" operations in the North Atlantic and the Caribbean. US forces boarded the Russian-flagged Marinera after a pursuit lasting almost two weeks as it travelled through the waters between Iceland and Scotland. The UK Royal Navy gave logistical support by air and sea. A second tanker - the M/T Sophia - was accused by the US of "conducting illicit activities" and boarded in the Caribbean. The moves come as the US seeks to choke off most exports of Venezuelan crude oil, and just days after its special forces seized Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in a lightning raid on his residence in Caracas. Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth wrote on X: "The blockade of sanctioned and illicit Venezuelan oil remains in FULL EFFECT - anywhere in the world." Moscow has denounced the seizure of the tanker sailing under its flag, and demanded that the US treat Russians aboard properly and permits them to return to Russia quickly. The transport ministry said it had given the vessel "temporary permission" to use the Russian flag, adding that no state had the right to use force against vessels properly registered in other states' jurisdictions. Reports suggested that Russia dispatched a submarine to safeguard the vessel, but it appears that US forces were able to board the tanker without facing any resistance. The White House described the ship as a "Venezuelan shadow fleet vessel deemed stateless after flying a false flag and had a judicial order" against it. Venezuela's leadership is co-operating with the US on the second tanker seized in the Caribbean, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said. "They understand that the only way they can move oil and generate revenue and not have economic collapse is if they co-operate and work with the United States," he told reporters. Earlier, US President Donald Trump had said that Venezuela - which has the world's largest proven oil reserves - "will be turning over" up to 50 million barrels of oil worth some $2.8bn (£2.1bn) to the US. Rubio, who briefed US lawmakers on the ongoing operation in Venezuela on Wednesday, said that the US would sell oil that is in Venezuela "in the marketplace at market rates" and that the US would control how the proceeds were dispersed "in a way that benefits the Venezuelan people". He said the US had a considered plan for the future of Venezuela, and that the administration was "not just winging it". Rubio said the Trump administration's plan in Venezuela was stabilisation, recovery and then transition. But the discussions surrounding oil were only one component of concern US lawmakers had over the escalating conflict. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said lawmakers needed answers to lingering questions of how many US troops could be involved and how much money the US involvement in Venezuela will cost. Republicans largely appeared to back the administration's moves in the region, though some expressed concern about what kind of say Congress had. The Senate is expected to vote next week on a bipartisan war powers resolution - an attempt to block continued military action in Venezuela. A war powers resolution - created in the wake of the Vietnam War - limits a president's power to involve US armed forces in hostilities without congressional approval. "If we're going to have continued engagement in the next phase, I think it has got to be subject to [war powers]," North Carolina's Thom Tillis said. Meanwhile, Missouri's Josh Hawley said that if the administration's actions were a law enforcement operation, then it does not require congressional approval, but "if it's a military operation involving a foreign head of government, even one we don't recognise officially, that's a very different situation". China - the biggest buyer of Venezuelan oil in recent years - has condemned the US moves and accused it of threatening global energy security. The seizure of the two tankers was announced by the US military in separate posts on social media on Wednesday. The US European Command said the M/V Bella 1 - using the former name of the Marinera - was boarded "for violations of US sanctions". "The vessel was seized in the North Atlantic pursuant to a warrant issued by a US federal court after being tracked by USCGC Munro", a Coast Guard cutter. Britain's Ministry of Defence said RAF surveillance aircraft and a naval support vessel, the RFA Tideforce, were among the UK military assets that took part in the operation, following a US request for assistance. Defence Secretary John Healey said the action was "in full compliance with international law", and "formed part of global efforts to crack down on sanctions- busting". The vessel has been accused of breaking US sanctions and shipping Iranian oil. Images published by Russian state broadcaster RT show a helicopter close to a ship that appears to be the M/V Bella 1. The Russian Maritime Register of Shipping shows that the tanker had changed its name to Marinera, and was sailing under the Russian flag. Its home port stated as the southern Russian city of Sochi on the Black Sea. The Russian transport ministry said US forces boarded the Marinera at about 15:00 Moscow time (1200 GMT), after which communications with the vessel were lost. US officials said that Marinera was falsely flying the flag of Guyana last month, which made it stateless. Experts told BBC Verify that the US called the ship Bella 1 as a vessel cannot change its flag during a voyage unless there was a real transfer of ownership or change of registry. The experts also said that under UN international maritime law, a stateless vessel can be boarded by authorities. Separately, the US Southern Command announced on Wednesday that the defence and homeland security departments "apprehended a stateless, sanctioned dark fleet motor tanker without incident". "The interdicted vessel, M/T Sophia, was operating in international waters and conducting illicit activities in the Caribbean Sea. The US Coast Guard is escorting M/T Sophia to the US for final disposition." The US Southern Command also posted a video showing a helicopter circling over a vessel. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said that "in two pre-dawn operations today, the Coast Guard conducted back-to-back meticulously co-ordinated boarding of two 'ghost fleet' tanker ships". She said both seized vessels "were either last docked in Venezuela or en route to it".

**Excerpt**

Who was Renee Nicole Good, the woman killed by ICE? The woman shot dead by a federal immigration agent in Minneapolis has been identified as Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mother of three who had just moved to the city. She was a prize-winning poet and a hobby guitarist, who was there as a legal observer of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activities, city leaders have said. But the Trump administration has called her a "domestic terrorist". Good's death has sparked protests across the country, with many people holding signs that read "Justice for Renee". Her mother, Donna Ganger, told the Minnesota Star Tribune that her daughter was "probably terrified" during the confrontation with officers that saw her fatally shot and that she was "one of the kindest people I've ever known". "She was extremely compassionate," Ganger told the daily newspaper. "She's taken care of people all her life. She was loving, forgiving and affectionate. She was an amazing human being." Her father, Tim Ganger, told the Washington Post that "she had a good life, but a hard life". A fundraiser for Good's family, which was set up with a target of $50,000 (£37,000), raised more than $370,000 in 10 hours. In what appears to be Good's Instagram account, which has now been made private, Good described herself as a "poet and writer and wife and mom", who was "experiencing Minneapolis". A US citizen, Good was originally from Colorado Springs and had moved to Minneapolis just last year from Kansas City. The Minnesota Star Tribune reports that she used to host a podcast with her second husband, Tim Macklin, who died in 2023. They had a son together, who is now six years old, Macklin's father told the newspaper. She had two other children with her first husband, who spoke to US media on condition that his name was not used. He said that Good was not an activist and that she was a devoted Christian who went to Northern Ireland on youth missions when she was younger. She had previously worked as a dental assistant and at a credit union, but had mainly been a stay-at-home mum in recent years, according to the Associated Press. Good studied creative writing at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia, and in 2020 she won an undergraduate prize from the Academy of American Poets for her piece entitled On Learning to Dissect Fetal Pigs. "When she is not writing, reading, or talking about writing, she has movie marathons and makes messy art with her daughter and two sons," her biography from the prize reads, as quoted in US media. It seems to have now been removed. Good graduated the same year from the university's College of Arts and Letters with a degree in English. Its president said in a statement that her sudden death was "yet another clear example that fear and violence have sadly become commonplace in our nation". "May Renee's life be a reminder of what unites us: freedom, love, and peace," Old Dominion University president Brian Hemphill wrote. Several state leaders have said that Good was at the scene of an ICE raid in the south of Minneapolis as a legal observer - a volunteer who monitors police and security forces at protests and operations. Their aim is to help maintain calm, deter misconduct and ensure legal rights are respected. Good's mother told the Minnesota Star Tribune that her daughter was "not part of anything" that involved challenging ICE agents. But White House officials, including the president, have said Good was not simply observing, but also interfering in the officers' work. US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Good had been "stalking and impeding their work" all day by "blocking them in" with her car and "shouting at them". Good "weaponised her vehicle", Noem told reporters, and then tried to run over one of the officers "in an attempt to kill or cause bodily harm to agents, an act of domestic terrorism". The ICE agent feared for his life, Noem said, and "fired defensive shots". This story was backed up by Trump, who wrote on Truth Social that "the woman driving the car was very disorderly, obstructing and resisting". He called her a "professional agitator" who "violently, willfully [sic], and viciously" ran over an ICE officer. But the city's mayor said the agent who shot Good had acted recklessly. "Having seen the video myself, I want to tell everybody directly: that is bullshit," Jacob Frey said. "This was an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying, getting killed." Good reportedly lived just a few blocks from where she was killed, and the scene is about one mile from where George Floyd was murdered in 2020 by a city police officer, sparking worldwide anti-racism protests.
