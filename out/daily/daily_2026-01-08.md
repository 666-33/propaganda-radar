US immigration agent fatally shoots woman in Minneapolis, officials say A US immigration agent fatally shot a 37-year-old woman on Wednesday in the city of Minneapolis, but the details of what led up to the incident have left a wide chasm between federal and local government officials. Trump administration officials claim the woman, identified as Renee Nicole Good, was a "violent rioter" attempting to run over Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents when one agent fired "defensive shots" into her vehicle. But city and state leaders, and Democrats nationally, are disputing that account. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey claims that "this was an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying", telling ICE agents: "Get out of our city." Multiple videos posted to social media by onlookers appear to show the moment of the shooting, which occurred around 10:25 local time. From various vantage points, a maroon SUV can be seen blocking a residential street in Minneapolis. A crowd of people, who appear to be protesting, are lining the sidewalk area. Multiple law enforcement vehicles appear nearby. Immigration agents pull up to the vehicle parked in the street, get out of the truck and order the woman behind the wheel to get out of the SUV. One of the agents tugs at the driver's side door handle. Another agent is positioned near the front of the vehicle. It's not clear exactly where the officer is standing based on the videos reviewed immediately by the BBC. That agent opens fire as the maroon SUV attempts to drive off. Three pops are heard, and the vehicle can be seen losing control and crashing into a white car parked along the street nearby. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz says he will not seek re-election - Trump administration says it's withholding childcare funds from Minnesota amid fraud allegations - Americast: How did a YouTuber stop federal funding to Minnesota? - The shooting comes amid a major immigration crackdown in Minneapolis by the Trump administration. US homeland security secretary Kristi Noem said the deceased woman's actions constituted "domestic terrorism" - and that ICE's operations in the city will continue. In a post on Truth Social, Trump said that an ICE officer was "viciously" run over. "It is hard to believe he is alive, but is now recovering in the hospital," he wrote. The president also blamed the "Radical Left" for "threatening, assaulting, and targeting our Law Enforcement Officers and ICE Agents on a daily basis". Speaking to press later in the day, Noem called the loss of life "preventable". But she repeatedly claimed that the ICE agent fired in self-defence and that Good used her vehicle as a "deadly weapon" against agents. The details are pending an FBI investigation she said, adding that the same agent injured Wednesday was also hit by a car in the line of duty in June. The Minneapolis City Council, however, said that Good was simply "caring for her neighbors" when she was shot and killed. Minnesota State Governor Tim Walz also pushed back on federal accounts of the incident. "Don't believe this propaganda machine," Walz wrote in response to a Department of Homeland Security post about the shooting. "The state will ensure there is a full, fair, and expeditious investigation to ensure accountability and justice." Top Democrats, like former Vice President Kamala Harris and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, also released statements Wednesday evening. Harris called the Trump administration's version of events "gaslighting". Protests erupted in several parts of the city as outraged Minneapolis residents condemned the shooting and called for ICE to leave. According to local media reports, the main gathering happened near the scene of the shooting. A makeshift vigil, displaying flowers and candles, was laid in the snow there, as protesters chanted slogans and delivered speeches. One group of protesters formed a line blocking the entrance to a federal courthouse with ICE officers standing inside, according to the Minneapolis Star-Tribune. The group of around 50 people chanted Good's name and dispersed after breaking a glass window. Protests are also taking place in cities outside Minneapolis, with gatherings expected in New Orleans, Miami, Seattle and New York City. Why is ICE in Minneapolis? The Trump administration deployed an additional 2,000 federal agents to the Minneapolis area in recent weeks in response to allegations of welfare fraud in the state, sources told the BBC's US partner, CBS News. Frey said in the press conference Wednesday that ICE is not making the city safer. "They're ripping families apart, they're sowing chaos in our streets," he said. The deployment, which began on Sunday, is one of the largest concentrations of Department of Homeland Security personnel in a US city in recent years. It follows an immigration enforcement campaign launched by ICE in late 2025 to target individuals in Minneapolis who were issued deportation orders, including members of the city's Somali community. That community has been criticised frequently by Trump, who has called them "garbage". "I don't want them in our country. I'll be honest with you," the president has said. "Their country's no good for a reason. Their country stinks." Trump later doubled-down on his remarks after a YouTube video by a conservative online content creator accused day care centres run by Somali immigrants of fraud. "Send them back from where the came," Trump wrote on Truth Social in December. He also withheld federal child care funds to the state of Minnesota in response. The Trump administration has sent ICE agents to other cities as well, all part of a widespread crackdown on what it says is unlawful immigration in the US.

Russian attacks leave two regions with widespread blackouts, Ukraine says Russian attacks left Ukraine's southeastern regions of Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhia almost entirely without power, the country's energy ministry said on Wednesday night. Critical infrastructure was "operating on reserve power", it said in a statement on Telegram, while officials said water supplies and the internet were also disrupted. Russia has recently intensified attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, aimed at paralysing power supplies during a harsh winter. "Ukraine's energy system is under enemy attacks every day, and energy workers are operating in extremely difficult conditions to provide people with light and heat," Ukraine's Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko wrote on Telegram. "Deteriorating weather conditions put additional strain on critical infrastructure," she said. The disruptions to power and heating have come as temperatures plunge. "Emergency restoration work in the regions affected by the attack will begin immediately as soon as the security situation allows," state energy company Ukrenergo said on Telegram. It added: "The primary task of energy workers is to restore critical infrastructure." Dnipro city Mayor Borys Filatov said on Telegram all city hospitals had been completely switched to generators. "There are the necessary water supplies, the treatment process does not stop. Water drainage in houses is also supported by alternative power sources," Filatov said. School holidays had been extended until 9 January because of the power cuts, he added. The head of the Zaporizhzhia regional administration, Ivan Fedorov, said everything possible was being done to restore power. "At this time, water utility workers have almost restored water to our homes, despite the fact that there is a complete blackout in the region," Fedorov said in a video message published on Telegram. DTEK, Ukraine's biggest private energy provider, is living in permanent crisis mode because of Russian attacks on the grid, its chief executive told the BBC last month, with most of Ukraine suffering from lengthy power cuts during winter. Maxim Timchenko, CEO of DTEK, which provides power for 5.6 million Ukrainians, said the intensity of strikes had been so frequent "we just don't have time to recover". As the fourth anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion approaches, Timchenko said Russia had repeatedly targeted DTEK's energy grid with "waves of drones, cruise and ballistic missiles" and his company had found it difficult to cope. The attacks come as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said European allies have not given him sound guarantees that they will protect his country in the event of new Russian aggression. Following talks in Paris on Tuesday, the UK and France signed a declaration of intent on deploying troops in Ukraine if a peace deal is made with Russia. Moscow has repeatedly warned that any foreign troops in Ukraine would be a "legitimate target".

**Excerpt**

Nick Reiner's lawyer removes himself from murder case A high-powered lawyer for Nick Reiner, who is charged with murdering his Hollywood director father Rob Reiner and mother Michele, has withdrawn from the case. It emerged that Alan Jackson would no longer represent Nick Reiner during a court hearing, though the attorney said afterwards that he believed his now-former client was innocent. Reiner, 32, did not enter a plea to charges of first-degree murder of his parents during a brief appearance at Los Angeles Superior Court. The Reiners were found dead with stab wounds on 14 December in the bedroom of their home in Brentwood, Los Angeles. Jackson said outside court after Wednesday's hearing that he had left the case. "Circumstances beyond my control, but more importantly circumstances beyond Nick's control, have made it impossible for us to continue our representation," he told reporters. "I'm legally and ethically prohibited from explaining the reasons why." The lawyer, who has previously represented Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey, added that Reiner was not guilty of murder. But LA County District Attorney Nathan Hochman said otherwise outside court. "We are fully confident that a jury will convict Nick Reiner beyond a reasonable doubt of the brutal murder of his parents - Rob Reiner and Michele Singer Reiner," said the prosecutor. The accused will now be represented in court by a public defender. To qualify for a publicly funded attorney, defendants must show they lack the means to fund their legal case. Rob Reiner's net worth was estimated at $200m (£150m) and it is unclear who was paying the retainer for his son's high-powered attorney. The accused has a brother and sister. When asked by the judge if he understood that he was waiving his right to enter a plea on Wednesday, Reiner said: "Yeah, I agree with it." The defendant smiled a few times during the hearing as he spoke to sheriffs' deputies. His new lawyer, public defender Kimberly Greene, met Reiner and asked for time to prepare for the case before her new client entered a plea. The next hearing is set for 23 February. Rob Reiner, 78, directed a handful of iconic films in a variety of genres, including This is Spinal Tap, Misery and A Few Good Men. Michele Singer Reiner, 70, was an actress, photographer and producer.

**Excerpt**

Rare mountain gorilla twins born in Africa's oldest national park A pair of twin mountain gorillas has been born in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo - a rare occurrence for the endangered primates, conservationists at Virunga National Park say. The community trackers, who discovered 22-year-old Mafuko hugging her newborns on Saturday, said the mother and her two baby sons all appeared to be well and healthy. Twin births are thought to account for about 1% of all mountain gorilla births, though exact data is not widely available. Virunga, situated in a conflict-prone part of DR Congo, is Africa's oldest and largest national park and was set up 100 years ago to protect mountain gorillas of which there are fewer than 1,100 left in the wild. They are only found in the Virunga and in national parks over the border in Rwanda and Uganda, according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which compiles a Red List of threatened species. The last birth of mountain gorilla twins in Virunga National Park was in September 2020. Mafuko herself gave birth to twins in 2016, but they both died within a week. Young gorillas rely entirely on their mothers for care and transport - and are extremely vulnerable in what can be a dangerous environment where poachers and many armed groups operate. The authorities at the park say additional monitoring and protection measures have been put in place to ensure the twins' survival during this critical period. Rangers would closely observe the young family and provide support if needed, they said. A gorilla's pregnancy lasts for about eight-and-a-half months, and females usually give birth to one infant every four years. According to Virunga conservationists, Mafuko has had a remarkable history of survival herself. Born in 2003 into the Kabirizi family, she lost her mother to armed attackers when she was four years old. She joined the Bageni family when she was 10 - and to date has been pregnant and given birth five times. Conservationists at Virunga, which is a Unesco World Heritage Site, say her latest offspring represent a significant boost for efforts to protect the endangered species. Thanks to anti-poaching patrols and community programmes - supported by the European Union and Unesco - mountain gorilla numbers in Virunga have slowly increased over the past decade. This success, which is documented by the IUCN and other partners, led to their status being upgraded from "critically endangered" to "endangered" in 2018. Virunga spans 7,800 sq km (3,000 sq miles) and is home to an astonishingly diverse landscape - from active volcanoes and vast lakes to rainforest and mountains.

**Excerpt**

Reality TV star Spencer Pratt announces run for LA mayor Reality television star Spencer Pratt has launched a campaign for mayor of Los Angeles, vowing to "expose the system". His longshot bid for city hall comes on the anniversary of a wildfire that destroyed his home and became one of California's most destructive blazes on record. Pratt, 42, made the announcement while speaking at a "They Let Us Burn" rally organised by residents who lost houses in the Palisades Fire. The protest marked a year since the fire ignited in the Pacific Palisades on 7 January 2025, tearing through the wealthy coastal community tucked between the Santa Monica Mountains and the Pacific Ocean. Another blaze, the Eaton Fire, sparked hours later on the other side of the city. In total, 31 people were killed and more than 16,000 homes and businesses were destroyed. Pratt posted photos on his Instagram page showing him signing what appears to be official campaign paperwork, although his filing was not yet official. "Business as usual is a death sentence for Los Angeles," he told Wednesday's demonstration, "and I'm done waiting for someone to take real action. That's why I am running for mayor. "But let me be clear, this just isn't a campaign. This is a mission, and we are going to expose the system. "We are going into every dark corner of LA politics and disinfecting the city with our light." He and his wife, former reality TV star Heidi Montag, lost their Pacific Palisades home in the fire. Pratt has since emerged as a vocal critic of Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and California Governor Gavin Newsom over their handling of the disaster. Pratt rose to fame in the mid-2000s as a cast member on MTV's Laguna Beach spin-off The Hills, where his relationship with Montag became a central storyline. The couple wed in 2008 and have two children. They later appeared on I'm a Celebrity…Get Me Out of Here and the UK edition of Celebrity Big Brother. Despite his fame, Pratt is a first-time candidate who faces long odds in a crowded field for June's non-partisan mayoral primary. Bass, who won the mayoralty in 2022 after defeating real estate developer Rick Caruso, is seeking re-election. More than a dozen other candidates have entered the race.

**Excerpt**

Trump calls for US military spending to rise more than 50% to $1.5tn President Donald Trump has called for US defence spending to be increased to $1.5tn (£1.1tn) in 2027 for what he called "these very troubled and dangerous times". That would be more than 50% higher than this year's $901bn budget, which was approved by Congress in December. "This will allow us to build the "Dream Military" that we have long been entitled to and, more importantly, that will keep us SAFE and SECURE, regardless of foe," Trump said on social media on Wednesday. In separate posts, the president said he would crack down on payouts to bosses and shareholders of major US defence contractors unless the firms speed up deliveries of armaments and build new manufacturing plants. Shares in major US defence equipment makers Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Raytheon rose by more than 5% in extended trading in New York trade after Trump made the announcements. Economists have previously warned that the gap between US spending and its income has reached unsustainable levels. But Trump said Washington can "easily hit" his proposed $1.5tn defence budget thanks to money being brought in by tariffs. Trump has been pushing for higher defence spending by the US and its allies since his first term in the White House. He said in another post on Wednesday that military equipment is not being made quickly enough and urged companies to build new and modern plants. Defence companies are issuing "massive" payouts to shareholders and stock buybacks at the expense of investing into production, Trump said. He also criticised the "exorbitant" pay packages of executives at arms manufacturers. "No Executive should be allowed to make in excess of $5 Million Dollars which, as high as it sounds, is a mere fraction of what they are making now." In a separate post, Trump singled out Raytheon, saying it was the "least responsive" to America's defence needs and the slowest to increase production. "Either Raytheon steps up and starts investing in more upfront Investment like Plants and Equipment, or they will no longer be doing business with the Department of War," Trump wrote in a separate post. The BBC has contacted Raytheon for comment. Trump's call for much higher defence spending comes as geo-political tensions have increased around the world. On Wednesday, the US military captured a Russian-flagged oil tanker suspected to have violated US sanctions. It came after US forces seized Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro at the weekend and took him to America to face drug trafficking charges. In December, China held military drills around Taiwan simulating the seizure and blockade of the island's key areas, as a warning against "separatist forces". Taiwan's push to ramp up its defence this year has also angered Beijing, which claims the self-ruled island as its territory.

**Excerpt**

Big freeze causes travel chaos across western Europe A spell of freezing weather bringing heavy snowfall and ice has caused transport disruption across western Europe. Hundreds of flights have been cancelled at several airports, while Eurostar services and haulage have also been affected. More than 700 flights were cancelled at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam, a major regional transport hub, on Wednesday. Meanwhile, France's civil aviation authority has asked airlines to cut 40% of flights scheduled for the main international airport in Paris. At least six people have died in weather-related incidents across Europe this week -five in France and one in Bosnia. Dutch national airline KLM warned Schiphol Airport was close to running out of de-icing fluid after days of freezing conditions. Spokesperson Stephan Donker told news agency Reuters that it was an "exceptional situation" at the Dutch airport, where more than 1,000 travellers spent the night. A few hundred beds have been set up there before and after security checks with food and drinks also provided, he said. Donker warned of knock-on effects from the disruption, with further delays and cancellations possible in coming days. In Paris, more than 100 flights were cancelled at Charles de Gaulle airport and 40 more at Orly. Dozens of fllights have been delayed or cancelled in and out of Heathrow and Brussels. Some Eurostar rail services between London and Paris were delayed or cancelled on Wednesday. Almost half of mainland France was on alert for heavy snow and black ice, with lorries banned from the roads in some areas. "It's better to be here than stuck on the road," driver Carle Bruno told news agency AFP at a roadside service station in the northern port of Le Havre. Five people died in two separate regions of France earlier this week as a result of treacherous driving conditions, authorities said, while a woman was also killed in Bosnia's capital, Sarajevo, after 40cm (16in) of snow fell on the city. In Paris, Guinean teenager Boubacar Camara, sleeping in a tent on the outskirts of the city, told AFP he had "no choice but to keep on going". "You just have to stay strong [and] make sure you don't die," the 19-year-old said. "We can't do anything about the cold. I'm not used to this at all." The rare sight of the French capital covered in snow drew residents and tourists out to ski down the slopes of Montmartre and along the Champs de Mars gardens below the Eiffel Tower. "It's exceptional, it's incredible," said Pierre, a Parisian. "It's magnificent and we're enjoying it. We also came across a lot of tourists and they look so happy."

**Excerpt**

Berlin power outage highlights German vulnerability to sabotage Power is being restored to the last homes hit by a five-day blackout in Germany's snow-covered capital, Berlin. The outage was caused by a suspected arson attack and came as temperatures dipped below freezing. It is reportedly the longest blackout in the capital's post-war history. A far-left militant group has claimed it was behind the outage. This week's images of residents - young and old - living through a prolonged blackout in the country's capital has reignited a debate about Germany's vulnerability to sabotage attacks, whether by domestic or foreign actors. Schools, hospitals and care homes are among the tens of thousands of properties that were affected in south-west Berlin. In Berlin's Steglitz-Zehlendorf district, on Mexikoplatz, a police van drove around announcing the imminent return of power over a tannoy. Residents regularly approached a group of emergency service workers for the latest information. Lena said her family had felt "lost" - relying on a battery-powered radio for updates. They have been cooking on a camping stove at home while trying to make sure their water pipes didn't freeze. Reinhold, 79, was still without power on Wednesday morning and going to his daughter's house to get warm. "But I always came back to sleep here even in the cold weather with a bobble hat on and sweater and a woollen blanket." The retired architect said that he was used to hardship having been born in post-war Germany. "I was born in 1947. When my mother and I came from the hospital... it was -20C in our shack. "My parents took turns every hour to see whether my hands were tucked in under the cover so my fingers wouldn't freeze off." Restoring electricity was happening on a "step-by-step basis", said fire service spokesman Adrian Wentzel. Resources have been pulled in from across Germany, he told the BBC, with an estimated 100,000 people affected. Hospitals have had to rely on emergency generators while some schools have had to close. It was early on Saturday when several cables on a bridge were spotted burning near the Lichterfelde gas-fired power plant. Subsequently, the far-left Vulkangruppe - or Volcano Group - appeared to claim responsibility, saying its target was the fossil energy industry. "We apologise to the less wealthy people in the south-west of Berlin," a lengthy statement read. "With the many owners of villas in these districts, our sympathy is limited," it added, likely referring to the fact that Steglitz-Zehlendorf is one of Berlin's wealthiest neighbourhoods. However, a different statement was later published online on the Indymedia site - purportedly from Vulkangruppe's founders. "We expressly distance ourselves from all actions of recent years," it said. Another recent high-profile incident saw activists admit being behind a suspected arson attack that halted production at the huge Tesla factory just outside Berlin in 2024. The exact structure and workings of Vulkangruppe is unclear, but German authorities describe them as left-wing extremists and say attacks have happened at irregular intervals since 2011 in Berlin and the surrounding state of Brandenburg. Domestic intelligence state that the group's aim is to disrupt "the day-to-day functions in order to harm the hated capitalist system". Federal prosecutors are investigating the latest incident as a terrorism offence, with possible charges including "membership in a terrorist organisation, sabotage, arson and disruption of public services". This week's outage was larger and lasted longer than a similar incident in September. Plans for a federal law to protect critical infrastructure have been in the works for years but were only presented to the German parliament in November. The "Kritis" bill sets out plans to identify key critical infrastructure transport as well as introduce minimum protection standards.

**Excerpt**

Inside the sub-zero lair of the world's most powerful computer It looks like a golden chandelier and contains the coldest place in the universe. What I am looking at is not just the most powerful computer in the world, but technology pivotal to financial security, Bitcoin, government secrets, the world economy and more. Quantum computing holds the key to which companies and countries win - and lose - the rest of the 21st Century. In front of me suspended a metre in the air, in a Google facility in Santa Barbara California, is Willow. Frankly, it was not what I expected. There are no screens or keyboards, let alone holographic head cams or brain-reading chips. Willow is an oil barrel-sized series of round discs connected by hundreds of black control wires descending into a bronze liquid helium bath refrigerator keeping the Quantum microchip a thousandth of a degree above absolute zero. It looks, and feels, very eighties, but if quantum's potential is realised, the metal and wire jellyfish structure in front of me will transform the world, in many ways. "Welcome to our Quantum AI lab," says Hartmut Neven, Google's Quantum chief, as we go through the high security door. Neven is something of a legendary figure, part technological genius, part techno music enthusiast, who dresses like he has snowboarded here straight from the Burning Man music festival – for which he designs art. Perhaps he has, in a parallel universe - more on that later. His mission is to turn theoretical physics into functional quantum computers "to solve otherwise unsolvable problems" and he admits he's biased but says these chandeliers are the best performing in the world. Secret temple of high science Much of our conversation is about what we are not allowed to film in this restricted lab. This critical technology is subject to export controls, secrecy and is at the heart of a race for commercial and economic supremacy. Any small advantage, from the shape of new components to the companies in global supply chains, is a source of potential leverage. There is a notable Californian vibe in this temple of high science, in its art and colour. Each quantum computer is given a name such as Yakushima or Mendocino, they are each wrapped in a piece of contemporary art, and various graffiti style murals adorn the walls illuminated by the bright winter sun. Neven holds up Willow, Google's latest Quantum chip, which has delivered two important milestones. He said it settled "once and for all" the discussion about whether quantum computers can do tasks that classical computers can't. Willow also solved a benchmark problem in minutes that would have taken the best computer in the world 10 septillion years, so more than a trillion trillion, or one with 25 zeros on the end, more than the age of the universe. This theoretical result was recently applied to the Quantum Echoes algorithm, impossible for conventional computers, which helps learn the structure of molecules from the same technology used in MRI machines. Neven reels off the ways he believes this Willow quantum chip will be used "to help with many problems that humankind has now". "It will enable us to discover medicines more efficiently," he says. "It will help us make food production more efficient, it will help us produce energy, to transport energy, to store energy..solve climate change and human hunger..." "It allows us to understand nature much better, and then unlock its secret to build technologies that make life more pleasant for all of us," he tells me. Some researchers believe that actual Artificial Intelligence will only be truly possible with Quantum. Members of the team here have just received the Nobel prize for the original research into "superconducting qubits" used here. The Willow chip has 105 qubits. Microsoft's quantum effort has 8 qubits, but uses a different approach. The race around the world is to get to 1 million qubits for a "utility scale machine" that can do quantum chemistry, drug design, without error. The technology is fragile. What is going on here is being watched carefully around the world. Professor Sir Peter Knight, Chair of the National Quantum Technology Programmes Strategy Advisory Board, says Willow broke new ground. "All the machines are really still at the toy model stage, they make mistakes. They need error correction. Willow was the first to demonstrate that you could do error correction, through repeated rounds of repairs, which improve," he says. This puts the technology on a path to being scaled towards accurately doing a trillion operations, perhaps within seven or eight years, rather than the two decades previously assumed. If the first quarter of this century was defined by the rise of the internet and then Artificial Intelligence, the next 25 years will surely be the start of the Quantum era. How does it work? Imagine trying to find a tennis ball in one of a thousand closed draws. A classical computer opens each one in order. A quantum computer opens all of them at the same time. Or similarly, instead of having to need a hundred keys to open a hundred doors in normal computing, quantum enables you to open all one hundred, with one key, instantly. These machines will not be for everyone. They will not shrink down into phones or AI glasses or laptops. But the point is that the power of these computers grow exponentially, and everyone is getting in on the act. I ask Nvidia chief Jensen Huang whether this poses a threat to his model of providing the specialised chips for AI. "No, a quantum processor will be added to a computer in the future," he replies. And one of the UK's leaders in the field points out what is up for grabs in the quantum world - the eventual power to decrypt almost anything from state secrets to Bitcoin. All of cryptocurrency will also have to be re-examined because of the quantum computing threat," Sir Peter says. A top partner to Nvidia last year said that while Bitcoin had a few years yet, the technology needed to fork to a stronger blockchain by the end of the decade. Tech industry sources refer to the process of "Harvest Now, Decrypt Later" to describe how state agencies are believed to be saving all of the worlds encrypted data at home and abroad with the expectation of future generations being able to access it. Global race And then there is the race across the world. China's approach is very different to the commercial race in the US and the West. At around $15bn (£11bn), the total resource committed to quantum technology in China is possibly of the order of all the rest of the world's government programmes put together, says Sir Peter. Since 2022 China has published more scientific papers on quantum than other countries, the efforts have been led by a pioneering physicist called Pan Jianwei. It is a key part of Beijing's 14th five-year plan. China took a decision to stop its tech companies such as Baidu and Alibaba from developing their own quantum research – and concentrate the people and the infrastructure into a state-run enterprise. China is trying to get the edge on quantum communications and satellites. Last year, Jianwei developed and tested the Zuchongzhi 3.0 quantum computer using similar technology though a different approach to that of Willow, claiming similar results. In the Autumn it was opened up for commercial use. It all feels a little like the World War II Manhattan Project to produce the first nuclear weapons, or the Space Race of the 21st Century. The UK is one of the scientific heartlands for quantum research. It was a British scientist who did the original research on superconducting qubits. There are dozens of companies and cutting-edge research here. The government plans to make a significant investment around this in the coming weeks. It is vital for economics, for military use, and for geopolitics. There is a hope that the UK will be the third power in this area. Parallel universes Back at the Willow lab, there are perhaps even more existential questions being posed. Last year Neven suggested that Willow's unprecedented speed supported some conceptions of the existence of a multiverse. Basically this speed could be explained by Willow having tapped into parallel universes for its compute power. Not all scientists bought this. "There is still a spirited debate," he tells me. "As you have learned in your lab visit, the reason quantum computers are so powerful is that within one clock cycle it can touch 2 to the 105 combinations simultaneously. It makes you question where are these different things?… There's a version of quantum mechanics to think about - the many worlds formulation - parallel universes or parallel reality." Willow had not proved this, Neven was careful to say, but was "suggestive that we should take this idea seriously". This is the cutting edge of the frontier of the world, of technology, of growth, and the British Government will soon pour hundreds of millions into catching up with Willow and the Chinese. It sounds like science fiction...it is rapidly becoming economic fact.

A new Bollywood film spotlights a forgotten India-China battle A recent Bollywood film has put the spotlight on a largely forgotten battle from the 1962 war between India and China. Called 120 Bahadur – Hindi for brave hearts – the film tells the story of Indian soldiers who fought valiantly to defend the Rezang La pass in the freezing Himalayan mountains of Ladakh. The film, with Farhan Akhtar as Major Shaitan Singh, failed at the box office but succeeded in spotlighting a battle often described as the only silver lining in a war India lost. "We felt it was very important that this story must he told, we wanted to honour the people who lived the story," dialogue writer Sumit Arora told the BBC. "We have taken some cinematic liberties, but our film stays very true to history." The war came as the relationship between India and China had been souring over border tensions and meetings to resolve the disputes had been unsuccessful. Beijing was also unhappy over India giving refuge to the Dalai Lama who had fled Tibet after the 1959 uprising. The month-long war started on 20 October with China attacking India. Beijing said it was "a self-defence counter-attack" and accused Delhi of "aggressively encroaching on Chinese territory and violating Chinese airspace". By the time China declared a unilateral ceasefire a month later - pulling back troops and releasing prisoners of war - India had lost about 7,000 soldiers and 38,000 sq km of territory. The two countries were later separated by an ill-defined 3,440km (2,100-mile) Line of Actual Control, marked in places by rivers, lakes and snowcaps. Beijing has said little officially about the war, beyond claiming its troops eliminated all Indian positions in the conflict zones, and has never commented on the battle of Rezang La. Fought at over 16,000ft (4,900m), it was one battle in a wider war China won. In India, however, it is remembered as an "epic battle" and "one of the greatest last stands" and inspired books and films. The battle took place on the night of 18 November from 3:30am to 8:15am. The pass was close to Chushul airstrip, which was "the primary nervous centre at a time when road network connecting the region with the rest of India was largely absent", Yadav says. Only five of the 120 men survived. Major Singh, who was among the dead, was posthumously awarded India's highest military honour Param Vir Chakra for his courage and leadership. Twelve other soldiers received gallantry medals. But initially when the survivors told their superiors about their audacious last stand, "tragically, no-one believed them", says Kulpreet Yadav, former navy officer and author of the 2021 book Battle of Rezang La. "The morale was low, we had bitterly lost the war, thousands of our soldiers, including a brigadier, were taken by China as prisoners of war. So, no-one believed such a heroic last-stand was possible," he adds. It was widely believed that the soldiers posted at Rezang La had either run away from the battle or had been taken as prisoners of war. "It was only three months later when the war was behind us, that a shepherd chanced upon the destroyed bunkers, empty shells, used gun-cartridges and bodies frozen in snow. And for the first time, an accurate account of the battle could be created." The soldiers - from the C (Charlie) Company of 13 Kumaon battalion - were deployed at the pass under Major Singh's command. He had been advised by his superiors to consider tactical retreat in case they ran out of ammunition, but when he discussed it with his men, they told him, "We'll fight till last man, last bullet", Yadav says. "When Chinese soldiers attacked the pass, C Company was prepared for a fight. But the Indian post was soon overwhelmed." It was a lopsided fight: 120 men facing thousands. While China hasn't declassified 1962 war documents, Indian estimates suggest at least 3,000 Chinese troops attacked the pass. "They had access to superior weapons and were well kitted out, whereas Indians were poorly equipped with semi-automatic rifles and a limited supply of 600 bullets for each soldier," he says. In her 2014 book on Major Shaitan Singh, journalist Rachna Bisht notes that C Company, from the plains, had never seen snow and lacked time to acclimatise. Subedar Ram Chander, a survivor, recalled, "The weather was terrible; we lacked proper winter clothes and shoes. "The jerseys, cotton trousers and light coat we were issued could hardly keep us warm in those freezing winds. The soldiers would get terrible headaches and the nursing assistant would rush from post to post doling out medicines," he said. On the night of the battle, with snow falling and temperatures around −24°C, Subedar Ram Chander told BBC Hindi earlier, "I told my superiors it was the day we had been waiting for." Bisht writes that C Company repelled the first wave, but Chinese mortar fire destroyed bunkers and tents, causing heavy casualties. The deadly third wave wiped out most of the men. Subedar Ram Chander's account of Major Singh's bravery is heartbreaking. "He had taken several bullets in his stomach. As he lay bleeding, in excruciating pain and drifting in and out of consciousness, he gave me instructions on how to carry on the fight. "Then he told me to go and be with the battalion. I told him, I cannot leave you. 'You have to go. It's my order,' he said." In February 1963, after the bodies and bunkers were discovered, a senior army official led Red Cross personnel and media to Rezang La, finding the battlefield "exactly as it had happened, frozen in snow". Writing about the discovery in her book, Bisht says, "Every single soldier they find is dead from multiple bullet wounds, shell injuries or splinters. Some lie dead in their bunkers, buried under boulders, others are still holding on to the butts of blown-off rifles. "The nursing assistant has a syringe in his hand and a roll of bandage, the soldier operating the mortar holds a bomb. Major Shaitan Singh is lying by a rock, a blood-stained bandage on his left arm, his stomach ripped open by a machine gun burst." In a war "mostly remembered with shame," Bisht writes that Major Shaitan Singh and his men achieved great glory. C Company was later renamed Rezang La Company and a memorial was built in Rewari - the town from where the soldiers came. After the ceasefire, the pass became a no-man's land and is part of the disputed territory. Yadav says if the C Company hadn't fought so valiantly, India's map would look very different today. "If it was not for these soldiers, I think India would have lost half of Ladakh. China would have captured the airfield and Chushul. "This battle was the only silver lining for India in the 1962 war."

### 11. [How tariff disruption will continue reshaping the global economy in 2026](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czejp3gep63o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

How tariff disruption will continue reshaping the global economy in 2026 President Trump's favourite word is tariffs. He reminded the world of that in his pre-Christmas "address to the nation". With the world still unwrapping the tariffs "gift" from the first year of his second term in office, he said they were bringing jobs, higher wages and economic growth to the US. That is hotly contested. What is less debatable is that they've refashioned the global economy, and will continue to do so into 2026. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) says that although "the tariff shock is smaller than originally announced", it is a key reason why it now expects the rate of global economic growth to slow to 3.1% in 2026. A year ago, it predicted a 3.3% expansion this year. For the head of the IMF, Kristalina Georgieva, things are "better than we feared, worse than it needs to be". Speaking on a podcast recently she explained that growth had fallen from a pre-Covid average of 3.7%. "This growth is too slow to meet the aspirations of people around the world for better lives," she said. Other forecasts for 2026 are even more pessimistic than that of the IMF. Yet the impact of the tariffs on the global economy was not as bad as it could have been, notes Maurice Obstfeld of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, who is also a former chief economist at the IMF. He says this is the case because "countries didn't retaliate strongly against the US". Obstfeld adds: "And the one country that did forcefully hit back, which is China, induced the US to back down very quickly. So we certainly avoided a trade disaster." However, after five rounds of trade talks, the world's two biggest economies still have more tariffs and other trade restrictions in place against each other than when Trump took office for the second time. The tariffs have pushed up costs for many businesses and increased uncertainty, which makes it harder to plan for and invest in the future. Despite the resilience seen so far, "these frictions and uncertainties take their toll over time", such as through efficiency loses, according to Obstfeld. Some of the damage of tariffs has been mitigated by lower interest rates, a fall in the value of the dollar, businesses finding clever ways around them, and, crucially, the many exemptions they contain. This may help explain why the UN trade agency UNCTAD is forecasting that the value of global trade grew 7% last year to reach more than $35tn (£26tn). Yet Obstfeld says the loopholes in US tariffs are a double-edged sword. "The exemptions mean lower tariffs in practice, but they also introduce a lot of uncertainty about how you get them." Countries including the UK, South Korea and Japan have managed to navigate those mysteries and agree trade deals with Trump. Others will hope they can do so during 2026. Whilst some economists have expressed doubt about how strongly the US is now growing, between July and September it expanded by 4.3%, the strongest annual growth in two years. "This is a very, very resilient economy, and I don't see why that wouldn't continue going forward," says Aditya Bhave, a senior economist at Bank of America. He thinks tariffs have added between 0.3% and 0.5% to US inflation, which in November was 2.7%, but "we probably haven't seen the full impact" yet. That matters given the US economy is driven by consumer spending, and that it accounts for 26% of the global economy, according to the IMF. Cost of living pressures are still a problem for people in many parts of the world, but there are some encouraging signs for them. In the eurozone, inflation has stabilised and is now running at 2.1%. But in the UK it's 3.2%, which as in the US, remains well above the central banks' 2% target. Others major influences on the global economy this year could include the renegotiation of the US Mexico Canada Agreement (USMCA) trade deal that Trump signed in his first term in office. Meanwhile, EU member states are due to vote on whether to ratify a South American trade deal that was signed more than a year ago. And back in the US, there is a lot riding on a Supreme Court decision on the legality of Trump's tariffs. One key input into the world economy is oil, and Wall Street bank Goldman Sachs expects the price of benchmark Brent Crude to fall around 8% this year to around $56 a barrel. That forecast is based on strong production in the US and Russia, rather than Trump's intervention in Venezuela, which is unlikely to lead to more oil on global markets in the short term. With oil used for energy and transport, another downward pressure on prices could be the resumption of global shipping through the Red Sea. A week before Christmas shipping giant Maersk sent a container ship through it for the first time in almost two years. Attacks by Houthi rebels based in Yemen, that were linked to the war in Gaza, mean major shipping companies have avoided it. Instead they've taken the longer and more expensive route around southern Africa. Maersk says that whilst it was "a significant step forward, we are not at a point where we can set a date on any potential wider network change back to the trans-Suez corridor". One of the most important destinations for container ships is China. It's where they pick up the toys, electronics, clothing and other goods that the country makes for the rest of the world. However, Beijing's trade relations with the US continue to cast a shadow over the global economy. The latest available data suggests the value of goods the world's two biggest economies sold each other fell for the third consecutive year in 2025. However, he did forecast the world's second-biggest economy would reach the landmark size of $20tn this year, and said that China is "ready to work with all countries to advance world peace and development". Tariffs, US sourcing of rare earth metals, and Chinese access to high-end US computer chips, have dominated talks between the two sides, but there are many other issues to be resolved when Xi hosts Trump in April, according to James Zimmerman who chairs the American Chamber of Commerce in China. "A lot is riding on that [meeting]," he says. "Our expectations are indeed low." But he adds that its "very, very important" that there is a sustained dialogue even if it takes time to deliver results. "Beijing wants a fair shake at being able to compete globally. They do feel that the environment in certain places has been very restrictive towards Chinese companies. Part of that is the over emphasis on security concerns." On the other side, Zimmerman says that US concerns include "how China manages its manufacturing output". "Overcapacity is an issue that is affecting a lot of different economies." He explains that China has shown its strength in manufacturing consumer goods, but that it needs to show it can make adjustments when demand for them falls, "so that there is not a situation where you have massive dumping of consumer goods around the world". In Europe, the continent's reliance on cheap Chinese imports is growing, according to research from Dutch bank ING. This is something that the EU is looking to crack down on in the coming months. Back in the US, limiting the inflow of foreign-made goods is a key part of Trump's trade policy. His Trade Representative Jamieson Greer recently wrote that re-industrialisation and increasing "manufacturing's share of our economy" was in the US national interest. In a hint towards tariffs staying in place, he argued that new investments in making cars, ships and pharmaceuticals in the US wouldn't be happening without them. However, since Trump's second term began, the number of Americans in manufacturing jobs has fallen slightly to just under 12.7 million. Obstfeld says that despite tariffs the US economy has continued to grow because of "resilient consumers who want to spend their money anyway", and the huge investment in AI that has sent stock markets to record highs. With some of Trump's key policy aims, such as creating new manufacturing jobs, still to be achieved Obstfeld adds: "I don't think tariffs are going to go away as a matter of policy or of discussion."
