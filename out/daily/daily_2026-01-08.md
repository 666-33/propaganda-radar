Published - The organisers of a professional women's tournament which has gone viral on social media because of a wildcard player's dire performance have acknowledged she should not have been allowed to play. Egyptian Hajar Abdelkader, 21, lost 6-0 6-0 and served 20 double faults during the first-round match in Nairobi on Wednesday, with the footage leaving many viewers wondering if she had ever played tennis before. The amateur player won only three points during her 37-minute debut - two double faults by opponent Lorena Schaedel and an unforced error from the bemused German, ranked 1,026th in the world. The match was part of an International Tennis Federation (ITF) W35 tournament, hosted by Tennis Kenya, the governing body for the sport in Kenya. Tennis Kenya said it had reached out to both Abdelkader and Schaedel to offer its support "given the extent and nature of coverage of this match". Tennis Kenya said Abdelkader had applied to enter the tournament as a wildcard and had been given a space at the last minute following the withdrawal of another player. The organisation said she was permitted to enter to maintain a balance of players and nations represented in the tournament, but said that in hindsight she should not have been allowed to play. "The federation has taken note of this experience and will ensure that such an extremely rare occurrence never happens again," the organisation added. "Tennis Kenya remains committed to fairness, transparency and the integrity of competition, as well as to the continued development of tennis in Kenya, East Africa, and across Africa." The Egyptian Tennis Federation confirmed to the BBC Abdelkader has never been registered as an Egyptian player and had not been entered into the tournament on Egypt's behalf. Egyptian Tennis Federation technical director Dia Nabil Loutfy said: "We would like to clarify that she is not registered with the Egyptian Tennis Federation, nor is she included in any of our official player lists. "Based on the information available to us, the player was previously residing in Kenya and participated in the ITF tournament in Nairobi through a wildcard granted by the Kenyan Tennis Federation. "The Egyptian Tennis Federation had no role whatsoever, whether directly or indirectly, in the nomination, approval, or issuance of this wildcard, and we were not involved in the player's entry into the tournament in any capacity." The organisation said it had no records relating to Abdelkader, and said she had never been affiliated with the Egyptian Tennis Federation.

Spain's Catholic Church signs deal on sexual abuse compensation Spain's Roman Catholic Church has reached an agreement with the government to compensate victims of sexual abuse by members of the clergy. The accord follows complaints that religious leaders had failed to tackle the issue adequately. It means the government will manage possible compensation in co-ordination with the Church, handling cases where other legal avenues are no longer available because the alleged crime took place too long ago or the individual accused has passed away. Hundreds of thousands of Spaniards are estimated by the government to have suffered sexual abuse at the hands of Church figures. The move follows similar redress schemes in other nations where abuse has been uncovered. "A democracy should not allow the existence of victims who have never been compensated [and] whose situation, on the contrary, had been covered up," said Justice Minister Félix Bolaños after signing the agreement. He added that the agreement sought to "pay off an historic, moral debt that we had with victims of abuse within the Church". The other signatories were Luis Argüello, president of the Episcopal Conference and leader of the Spanish Catholic Church, and Jesús Díaz Sariego, president of Confer, which represents Catholic congregations and religious orders. Mr Sariego said the initiative was unprecedented as it tackled crimes that had gone past the statute of limitations. Argüello, who is archbishop of Valladolid, described the accord as "another step forward along the path that for years we have been travelling". A 2023 study by the Spanish ombudsman's office, which investigates public complaints, estimated that 1.1% of the population had suffered sexual abuse at the hands of members of the clergy or individuals linked to the Church - the equivalent of 440,000 people. The Church has contested these findings. It set up a reparation scheme that year to manage abuse claims. However, both the Socialist-led government and victims' organisations have been dissatisfied with the scheme's model, which did not allow input or oversight from outside the Church. In November, the Church said that 58 cases had been "resolved" under its framework. However, critics accused the institution of a lack of transparency and slowness. Newspaper El País, which has created a database of clerical abuse allegations, has documented cases affecting 2,948 victims dating back as far as the 1940s. Last June, several victims' groups broke off ties with the Spanish Church, alleging that it had excluded them from seeking reparations. The Vatican subsequently appeared to take a more prominent role, with the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors meeting Spanish victims and urging the country's Catholic leaders to bolster and facilitate reparations. Meetings between Justice Minister Bolaños and the Vatican's Secretary of State, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, appear to have raised the pressure further on the Church authorities in Madrid. Under the new system, victims will be able to file their cases before a new agency created by the justice ministry, which will then take them before the ombusdman's office, which will draw up a reparation proposal. The Church must then agree to the proposed compensation – if not, the case will be referred back to the ombudsman. Reparation can be symbolic, psychological, or economic, according to the agreement. In each case, the Church is responsible for its execution. The amount of financial compensation that could be paid out is not specified. However, the ombudsman has suggested following the lead of other European countries. In Belgium, an average of €6,000 ($7,000; £5,210) has been paid to victims in such cases, although the late Pope Francis described that amount as "too small". Ireland's redress board paid out an average of around €63,000 to victims. Sexual abuse by members of the clergy first received significant attention in the US and Canada in the 1980s. In the 1990s, the issue began to grow, with stories emerging in Argentina, Australia and revelations of widespread historical abuse in Ireland. By the early 2000s, sexual abuse within the Church was a major global story. Spain, a Catholic country, was affected by relatively few scandals in that time. However, investigations by the media have brought the issue to light more recently. In the most recent high-profile case, the bishop of Cádiz, Rafael Zornoza, resigned in November, following an accusation of abuse dating back to the 1990s. Victims' organisations have welcomed the new agreement in Spain. "This is an endemic, structural evil which has been within the Church and which it should have tackled a long time ago instead of covering up paedophiles," said Juan Cuatrecasas, of the Association for Stolen Childhood (Anir), who said he was "fully satisfied".

**Excerpt**

US involvement in Venezuela could last years, Trump says US President Donald Trump has said that his country's involvement in Venezuela could last for years. He told the New York Times that "only time will tell" how long his administration would "oversee" the running of the South American nation following the seizure by US forces of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro in a raid on Saturday. Trump also did not say if or when elections would be held in Venezuela to replace the interim government headed by Maduro loyalist Delcy Rodríguez. Meanwhile, Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado said the ouster of Maduro had set off an "irreversible process" that would lead Venezuela to be "free". New York Times (NYT) journalists quizzed Trump on his plans for the future of Venezuela days after he had said his administration would run the oil-rich nation. Earlier on Wednesday, the White House had said that the US would control sales of sanctioned oil "indefinitely". US Energy Secretary Chris Wright argued that the US needed control over Venezuela's oil sales for leverage over the interim government in Caracas. Trump said his administration would be "taking oil" from Venezuela, which has the world's largest proven reserves, but acknowledged it would "take a while" to get the country's oil industry up and running. Venezuela's oil production has plummeted as a result of mismanagement on the part of the Maduro government and that of his predecessor, as well as years of US sanctions. Trump told the NYT that US Secretary of State Marco Rubio was "in constant communication" with Rodríguez, who was designated as Venezuela's interim leader by the country's Supreme Court, which is dominated by Maduro loyalists. He added that Rodríguez is "giving us everything that we feel is necessary." The US president had earlier said that the interim government had agreed to use the proceeds from the sale of its oil to buy only US-made goods. According to the NYT reporters, Trump did not answer their questions about why he recognised Rodríguez as Venezuela's new leader. Many Venezuela analysts had expected that the ouster of Maduro would be followed swiftly by the return to the country of opposition leaders Edmundo González and María Corina Machado. But in his first news conference following the US raid, Trump was dismissive about Machado, alleging that she lacked the "respect" and support to lead Venezuela. "I think it would be very tough for her to be the leader," he said. Machado managed to unite opposition groups behind her ahead of the 2024 presidential election but was barred from running for the presidency by officials loyal to the Maduro government. She then threw her weight behind former diplomat González, who acted as her proxy. The electoral council, which is also dominated by government loyalists, declared Maduro re-elected. However, voting tallies collected by the opposition, which have been independently verified, suggest González won by a landslide. González went into exile to escape the government repression that followed the election, and Machado went into hiding within Venezuela. She embarked on a perilous journey by land, sea and air to reach Oslo in December to collect the Nobel Peace Prize she was awarded for her "tireless work promoting democratic rights" in Venezuela. Her current whereabouts are unknown but she has said that she plans to return to Venezuela soon. In an interview with Venezuelan opposition news site La Patilla, she insisted that the ousting of Maduro had set her country on an irreversible path towards freedom. She said that she hoped this new phase of the transition process would be "as short and swift as possible". She added that the interim government, which she said was "the same regime it was under Maduro" was "being given instructions to dismantle itself". Machado insisted that González was the legitimate president-elect and urged that his mandate be respected. She stressed that "the first thing" that needed to happen was for the political prisoners to be released. Machado is not the only one who has been demanding that the more than 800 political prisoners held in Venezuela's notorious jails be freed. On Wednesday, Republican lawmaker María Elvira Salazar published several posts on social media insisting they be released "immediately". However, in his interview with the NYT, Trump instead "appeared far more focused on the rescue mission than the details of how to navigate Venezuela's future", according to the journalists who spoke to him. Pressed on what the US plans for Venezuela are, he said that "we will rebuild it in a very profitable way". He added: "We're going to be using oil, and we're going to be taking oil. We're getting oil prices down, and we're going to be giving money to Venezuela, which they desperately need." The US president is expected to meet representatives of three of the largest US oil companies at the White House on Friday to discuss those plans further. Meanwhile, the US Senate on Thursday voted 52-47 to take up a resolution intended to block the Trump administration from conducting further military action in Venezuela. The vote clears the way for debate on the resolution invoking the War Powers Act, but another vote would be needed for the final passage. It marks the first time during the second Trump administration that the Senate has voted to curb the president's use of military power. But it remains largely symbolic as it is not clear whether it will also clear the House, and if it does the president can still use his veto power to block it.

**Excerpt**

Lebanese army says it has taken over security in Hezbollah-dominated south The Lebanese army says it has taken over security in the south of the country, which for decades had been dominated by the Iranian-backed movement Hezbollah, amid fears that Israel could escalate its military offensive against the group. Lebanon has been under intense international pressure, particularly from the US, to disarm Hezbollah, a powerful militia and political party, since a ceasefire deal in November 2024 ended a devastating year-long war between Israel and Hezbollah. The army had set a year-end deadline to clear the area south of the Litani river, about 30km (20 miles) from the border with Israel, of non-state weapons in the first phase of a government-backed plan. The army said its objective had been achieved in an "effective and tangible way" but that there was more work to be done to clear unexploded ordnance and tunnels. Responding to the Lebanese army's statement, the office of the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said efforts toward fully disarming Hezbollah were "an encouraging beginning, but they are far from sufficient, as evidenced by Hezbollah's efforts to rearm and rebuild its terror infrastructure with Iranian support". In recent months, Lebanese soldiers have dismantled infrastructure in areas once controlled by Hezbollah in the south without facing resistance from the group, which says it has complied with the ceasefire deal and removed its fighters from those areas, where Palestinian factions including Hamas had also operated. But US and Israeli officials have expressed frustration with the pace of the army's efforts. Israel has accused Hezbollah - which is considered a terrorist organisation by countries including the US and the UK - of trying to recover its military capabilities, including in the south. In recent days, Israeli media reported that Netanyahu had been given a green light by US President Donald Trump to intensify its military campaign against Hezbollah. Despite the ceasefire, Israel has carried out near-daily attacks on targets it says are linked to Hezbollah and continues to occupy at least five positions in southern Lebanon. The Lebanese government rejects the Israeli claims, and says Israel's actions are a violation of the ceasefire deal and an obstacle to the army's efforts. Israel has not made the evidence it says it has about Hezbollah's activities public, and the UN peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon, known as Unifil, says it has seen no indication that the group is rebuilding its infrastructure in the areas where it operates. Lebanese officials say the next stage of the army's plan will focus on the area between the Litani and the Awali rivers, which includes the port city of Sidon. There is no timeline for that, and the cash-strapped Lebanese army has also complained of insufficient funding and equipment. Meanwhile, it is unclear if Hezbollah will resist the measures in other areas as it says it will not disarm north of the Litani. The group also has a strong presence in the eastern Bekaa valley and in Beirut's southern suburbs, known as the Dahieh. Lebanon's President Joseph Aoun has rejected the use of force against the group, saying this could exacerbate sectarian divisions and lead to violence. Hezbollah - which is also a political party with representation in parliament and in the government, and a social movement that runs hospitals and schools - still enjoys significant support among Lebanon's Shia community. Opponents, however, see this as a unique opportunity to disarm the group, after its losses in the war. Hezbollah, so far, has rejected calls from the authorities to discuss the future of its weapons. In Lebanon's south, tens of thousands of residents remain displaced and communities lie in ruins, as Lebanon's international partners have conditioned funds for reconstruction on measures that include action against Hezbollah.

**Excerpt**

Saudi-led coalition says UAE helped smuggle separatist leader out of Yemen The Saudi-led coalition in Yemen has alleged the United Arab Emirates helped smuggle a separatist leader out of the country after he was expelled from Yemen's presidential council and accused of treason. A coalition spokesman said Aidarous al-Zubaidi, head of the UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council (STC), fled Aden on Tuesday night in a boat to Somaliland. He was then flown by a cargo aircraft to Abu Dhabi via Mogadishu under the supervision of UAE officers, he added. There was no immediate comment from the UAE or STC. The STC insisted Zubaidi was still working from Aden on Wednesday, after the coalition said he had failed to fly to Riyadh for talks and had fled to an unknown location. The coalition also accused Zubaidi of moving STC forces from bases in Aden to his home province of al-Dahle and said it had carried out air strikes on them in response. The STC said the strikes, which reportedly killed four people, were "unjustified" and "inconsistent" with calls for dialogue with Yemen's internationally recognised government, which is overseen by the presidential council and backed by Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia and the UAE have been allies in the war against Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi movement over the past decade, but the infighting between the rival factions they support has deepened a rift between them and pushed southern Yemen to the brink of a new conflict. On Thursday, coalition spokesman Maj Gen Turki al-Malki said it had "reliable intelligence" showing Zubaidi and his associates fled from Aden's port in the early hours of Wednesday on board a St Kitts and Nevis-flagged passenger ship. The vessel sailed across the Gulf of Aden to Berbera in the breakaway region of Somaliland, where a Ilyushin Il-76 cargo aircraft was waiting, he added. Malki said Zubaidi and his associates "boarded the aircraft under the supervision of UAE officers" and flew first to Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, before heading towards the Arabian Sea "without a declared destination". "The aircraft disabled its identification systems over the Gulf of Oman, reactivating them only 10 minutes prior to landing at Al-Reef Military Air Base in Abu Dhabi," he added, without saying directly whether Zubaidi was still aboard. Somalia's immigration agency said it was investigating an "alleged unauthorised use" of its airspace and airports. STC-aligned forces have in recent years taken control of much of southern Yemen, which they want once again to be an independent state, by pushing out forces loyal to the government. However, Saudi Arabia warned last week that the advances near the kingdom's borders constituted threats to its national security as well as the security and stability of Yemen. It also accused the UAE of "pressuring" its separatist allies to push into eastern Yemen and expressed support for a demand from the presidential council for all Emirati forces to leave. At the same time, the Saudi-led coalition - which was formed in 2015 by Arab states, including the UAE, after Houthi rebels seized control of north-western Yemen - struck what it said was a shipment of weapons and military vehicles for the STC that had arrived from the UAE. The UAE expressed "deep regret" at the Saudi accusations and denied there were any weapons, but agreed to pull its remaining forces out of the country. Since then, forces loyal to the government have retaken control of Hadramawt and al-Mahra with the help of coalition air strikes. Witnesses and government officials told Reuters news agency on Thursday that Aden was also now coming under the control of Saudi-backed forces.

**Excerpt**

Algeria apologises after player mocks Congolese superfan dressed as pan-African hero Algeria's football federation has apologised to a Congolese superfan who has become one of the stars of the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) being held in Morocco. Michel Nkuka Mboladinga has supported the Democratic Republic of Congo by dressing up as the country's revered first leader Patrice Lumumba and remaining stock-still throughout every match. He stood on a pedestal with his right arm raised - just like Lumumba's famous statue in DR Congo's capital, Kinshasa - as fans around him cheered. But after Algeria beat the Leopards on Tuesday, Algerian player Mohamed Amine Amoura faced a backlash for mimicking Mboladinga and falling to the ground as though the statue had been knocked over. This prompted the 25-year-old forward to post an apology on Instagram, saying his gesture was not intended to disrespect DR Congo. The Desert Foxes had looked like they were heading to penalties before Adil Boulbina scored in the 119th minute, securing a place in the quarter-finals where they face Nigeria on Saturday. "At that moment, I wasn't aware of what the person or symbol in the stands represented. I simply wanted to joke around, in a good-natured way, without any ill intent or desire to provoke anyone," said Amoura, who also plays for German team Wolfsburg. Lumumba is not only seen as a hero in DR Congo, where he was assassinated in 1961 in a plot backed by Belgium, the UK and the US, but is also regarded as one of the most prominent voices in Africa's anti-colonial movement. After the final whistle on Tuesday at Rabat's Moulay Hassan Stadium, which saw the Leopards knocked out of the tournament, Mboladinga - who with his hairstyle and glasses looks remarkably like Lumumba - was visibly distraught. He removed his glasses to wipe away some tears, slowly got down from his makeshift plinth and leant against it with his head in his hands. The Algerian Football Association (Faf) reached out to Mboladinga following Amoura's contrite statement and invited him to the hotel where the North African team are staying in Rabat to meet the players. The superfan was not able to get to Morocco's capital so Faf's media officer Saïd Fellak travelled to Casablanca's Novotel Hotel to see him and other Congolese supporters on Wednesday evening. There Fellak presented Mboladinga with his own Desert Foxes jersey with the name "Lumumba" printed on the back. Videos and photos of the entente cordiale, also attended by Congolese Sports Minister Didier Budimbu, were captured by Congolese fans, showing Mboladinga next to Fellak with his new football shirt. Allow Instagram content? It is not clear if the Lumumba superfan and his pedestal will make it to Mexico, where the Leopards are expected to play in March's highly anticipated intercontinental World Cup qualifiers. Six teams will compete to be allocated the final two places up for grabs for the World Cup, which kicks off in June. Algeria have already qualified for the tournament that is being jointly hosted by Canada, Mexico and the United States - and Amoura hopes that he will get to see the Leopards there too. "I respect Congo and their team. Honestly, I wish them the best and hope they qualify for the World Cup," he said.

**Excerpt**

Two starkly opposed Americas laid bare by deadly ICE shooting The fatal shooting of a woman in Minneapolis by a federal law-enforcement officer is laying bare the sharp divides in US politics – and threatening to inflame an already contentious debate over immigration policy. The incident took place in broad daylight. There are multiple videos taken by bystanders from various locations. And yet even the basic facts are being disputed. Almost immediately after the shooting, two starkly different accounts began to take shape. Any ambiguities in the videos shared online were seized upon - different angles and different screengrabs were used to push a particular narrative. And on the public stage, state and federal officials openly disagreed. According to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, the driver – 37-year-old Renee Good – was to blame. As she drove away from ICE officers, she "weaponised her car" in a "domestic terror attack", Noem said. US President Donald Trump blamed a "professional agitator" and a "radical left movement of violence and hate" in a Truth Social post. National Democrats - and state and local officials in Minnesota - have painted a completely different picture. Jacob Frey, the Democratic Mayor of Minneapolis, said a federal agent "recklessly" used lethal force. He also issued an expletive-laced demand for immigration enforcement officials to leave the city. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz called the shooting "totally predictable" and "totally avoidable", arguing it was a direct consequence of the surge in federal immigration officers into Minneapolis and surrounding areas in recent days. "We have been warning for weeks that the Trump administration's dangerous, sensationalised operations are a threat to our public safety," he said on Wednesday. This clear division between the federal government and local officials was only further illustrated on Thursday morning, when the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension announced that the justice department and the FBI were no longer co-operating with its investigation into the shooting. Federal agencies, it said, would be solely responsible for handling the investigation into the use of lethal force by the ICE agent. That Minnesota has become the epicentre of a growing conflict over immigration enforcement in recent months is both unsurprising - and ironic. It is ironic because Good's death occurred just a few miles from where, in 2020, Minneapolis police killed George Floyd during an attempted arrest, setting off nationwide Black Lives Matters protests – including some, in Minneapolis, that turned violent. Walz has put the state's National Guard on standby, and cautioned the hundreds of protesters who have taken to the streets not to resort to violence. Minnesota's central role in this latest flare-up is unsurprising because it marks the culmination of conflict, controversy and scandal that had been building for months. The recent surge in immigration enforcement comes after Trump derided the state's large Somali immigrant population - most of whom are US citizens - after members of the community were convicted of widespread fraud in the distribution of federal Covid aid. "Hundreds of thousands of Somalians are ripping off our country, and ripping apart that once great state," he said in November. "We're not going to put up with these kind of assaults on law and order by people who shouldn't even be in our country." Under pressure, Walz abandoned his bid for re-election last week, as allegations mounted of corruption in state social services, including childcare and food aid. The surge in immigration enforcement in the state is just the latest example of the Trump administration using federal officials to target communities suspected of having high rates of undocumented migrants. The use of force during this operation is far from an isolated incident, either. The Minnesota incident was at least the ninth immigration-enforcement-related shooting since September – all involving individuals who were targeted while in their vehicles - according to the New York Times. The intensity with which the immigration actions have been undertaken – in an expanding list of cities across the US – has led to protests and calls from Democratic officials for greater oversight, accountability and restraint among law enforcement agents. The fatal Minneapolis shooting has already given these efforts new urgency among their advocates. Trump administration officials, for their part, are pressing ahead – citing the mandate they say they received from voters in the 2024 presidential election as well as the evidence, in dramatically reduced undocumented entries into the US, that their efforts have proven effective. They have also vigorously disputed the argument that the video of the Minneapolis shooting is evidence of a misuse of lethal force. "The gaslighting is off the charts and I'm having none of it," Vice-President JD Vance wrote in a post on X. "This guy was doing his job. She tried to stop him from doing his job." While he said the incident was tragic, he added that "it falls on this woman and all of the radicals who teach people that immigration is the one type of law that rioters are allowed to interfere with". Walz, in his next public comments, was quick to counter. "People in positions of power have already passed judgement, from the president to the vice-president to Kristi Noem, have stood and told you things that are verifiably false, verifiably inaccurate," he said. "They have determined the character of a 37-year-old mom that they didn't even know." It appears that even video evidence is open to interpretation at this point. Each person sees the same images and draws decidedly different conclusions – ones that frequently, perhaps not surprisingly, reinforce their previously established positions. The chasm in US politics seems as immutable as it is daunting.

**Excerpt**

Bowen: Trump risks pushing world back to age of empires Only a few hours after the Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro was removed from his palace, his job and his country by US special forces, Donald Trump was still marvelling about how it felt to monitor a live feed of the raid from his Mar-a-Lago mansion. He shared his feelings with Fox News. "If you could see the speed, the violence, they call it that... It was amazing, amazing work by these people. No one else could do something like this." The US president wants and needs quick victories. Before he took office for the second time, he boasted that ending the Russia-Ukraine war would be a single day's work. Venezuela, as presented in Trump's statements, is the quick, decisive victory that he has craved. Maduro is in a prison cell in Brooklyn, the US will "run" Venezuela - and he has announced that the Chavista regime, now with a new president, will turn over millions of barrels of oil and that he will control the way the profits are spent. All, so far anyway, without an American life lost and without the long occupation that had such catastrophic consequences after the invasion of Iraq in 2003. For now, at least, Trump and his advisers, publicly at least, are ignoring Venezuela's complexities. It is a country bigger than Germany, still run by the regime of factions that has embedded corruption and repression into Venezuelan politics. Instead, Trump is enjoying a geopolitical sugar rush. Judging by their statements as they flanked him at Mar-a-Lago, so are US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of War Pete Hegseth. Since then, they have repeated that Trump was a president who does what he says he is going to do. He's made it clear to Colombia, Mexico, Cuba, Greenland – and Denmark – that they need to be nervous about where his appetite will take him next. Trump likes nicknames. He still calls his predecessor Sleepy Joe Biden. Now he's trying out a new name for the Monroe Doctrine, which has been a foundation of US policy in Latin America for two centuries. Trump renamed it, naturally, after himself – the Donroe doctrine. James Monroe, the fifth president of the United States, unveiled the original in December 1823. It declared that the western hemisphere was America's sphere of interest – and warned European powers not to meddle or establish new colonies. The Donroe Doctrine puts Monroe's 200-year-old message on steroids. "The Monroe Doctrine is a big deal, but we've superseded it by a lot," Trump said at Mar-a-Lago as Maduro, blindfolded and shackled, was on this way to jail. "Under our new national security strategy, American dominance in the western hemisphere will never be questioned again." Any rival or potential threat, especially China, has to stay out of Latin America. It's not clear where that leaves the massive investments that China has already made in the region. Donroe also extends the huge area the US calls its "backyard" north to Greenland. The 2026 equivalent of Monroe's copperplate handwriting is a photo of a frowning, moody looking Trump posted by the US State Department on social media. The words with it say, "this is OUR hemisphere – and President Trump will not allow our security to be threatened". That means using US military and economic power to coerce countries and leaders that get out of line – and to take their resources if necessary. As Trump warned another possible target, the president of Colombia – they need to watch their ass. Greenland is in America's sights, not just because of its strategic importance in the Arctic – but because it has rich mineral resources that are becoming accessible as climate change melts the ice sheets. Rare earths from Greenland and heavy crude oil from Venezuela are both seen as strategic US assets. Unlike other interventionist US presidents, Trump does not cloak his actions with the legitimacy, however spurious, of international law or the pursuit of democracy. The only legitimacy he needs comes from his belief in the force of his own will, backed by raw US power. From Monroe to Donroe, foreign policy doctrines matter to US presidents. They shape their actions and their legacies. In July, the US will celebrate its 250th birthday. In 1796, its first president, George Washington, announced he wouldn't seek a third term with a farewell address that still resonates today. Washington issued a series of warnings about the US and the world. Temporary alliances in time of war might be necessary, but the US should otherwise avoid permanent alliances with foreign nations. That started the tradition of isolationism. At home, he warned citizens to beware of extreme partisanship. Division, he said, was a danger to the young American republic. The Senate does an annual public re-reading of Washington's farewell address, a ritual that does not cut through the hyper-partisan and polarised politics of the US. Washington's warning about the dangers of entangling alliances was followed for 150 years. After World War One, the US left Europe and returned to isolationism. But World War Two made the US into a global power. And that is where another doctrine comes in, much more significant for the way Europeans have lived – until Trump. By 1947, the Cold War with the Soviet Union had turned frigid. The UK, left bankrupt by the war, told the US it could no longer fund the Greek government's fight with communists. Then-President Harry Truman's response was to commit US to support, in his words, "free peoples resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures". He meant threats from the Soviet Union or homegrown communists. That was the Truman Doctrine. It led to the Marshall Plan, which rebuilt Europe, followed in 1949 by the creation of Nato. Atlanticists in the US, like Harry Truman and George Kennan - the diplomat who came up with the idea of containing the Soviet Union - believed those commitments were in America's interests. There is a direct line from the Truman Doctrine to Joe Biden's decision to fund Ukraine's war effort. In many ways, the Truman Doctrine created the relationship with Europe that Trump has been dismantling. It was a sharp break with the past. Truman ignored Washington's warning about permanent entangling alliances. Now Trump is breaking with Truman's legacy. If he follows through with his threat to somehow take possession of Greenland, which is Danish sovereign territory, he could destroy what's left of the transatlantic alliance. The Maga ideologue and powerful Trump adviser Stephen Miller summed it up earlier this week on CNN. The US, he said, was operating in the real world that "is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power… these are the iron laws of the world since the beginning of time". No US president would deny the need for strength and power. But from Franklin D Roosevelt, through Truman and all their successors until Trump, the men in the Oval Office believed the best way to be powerful was to lead an alliance, which meant give and take. They supported the new United Nations and the drive to make rules to regulate the behaviour of states. The US, of course, has ignored and violated international law many times – doing much to hollow out the idea of a rules-based international order. But Trump's predecessors did not try to sweep away the notion that the international system needed regulation, however flawed and incomplete. That is because of the catastrophic consequences in the first half of the 20th Century of the rule of the strongest – two world wars and millions dead. But the combination of Trump's "America First" ideology and his businessman's acquisitive, transactional instincts have led him to believe that America's allies need to pay for the privilege of his favour. Friendship seems too strong a word. America's interests, in the narrow definition laid out by the president, require it to stay top dog by acting alone. Trump changes his mind often. But one constant appears to be his belief that the US can use its power with impunity. He says that it is the way to make America great again. The risk is that, if Trump sticks to his course, he will push the world back to the way it was in the age of empires a century or more ago - a world where big powers, with spheres of influence, sought to impose their will, and where mighty authoritarian nationalists led their peoples to disaster.
