Violent clashes reported as Iran protests spread to more areas There were violent clashes between anti-government protesters and security forces in several locations in Iran on Wednesday, as a wave of unrest sparked by the country's economic crisis continued for an 11th day. Iran's semi-official Fars news agency, which is close to the Revolutionary Guards, said two policemen were shot and killed by armed individuals in the south-western town of Lordegan. Videos posted on social media showed a tense stand-off between protesters and security forces, with the sound of gunfire in the background. In footage from several other areas, security forces appear to fire guns and tear gas towards crowds of protesters, some of whom are throwing stones. The protests have so far spread to 111 cities and towns across all 31 provinces, according to the US-based Human Rights Activist News Agency (HRANA). It has reported that at least 34 protesters and four security personnel have been killed during the unrest, and that 2,200 protesters have been arrested. BBC Persian has confirmed the deaths and identities of 21 people, while Iranian authorities have reported the deaths of five security personnel. The protests began on 28 December, when shopkeepers took to the streets of the capital, Tehran, to express their anger at another sharp fall in the value of the Iranian currency, the rial, against the US dollar on the open market. The rial has sunk to a record low over the past year and inflation has soared to 40% as sanctions over Iran's nuclear programme squeeze an economy also weakened by government mismanagement and corruption. University students soon joined the protests and they began spreading to other cities, with crowds frequently heard chanting slogans against the country's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and sometimes in support of Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran's late former shah. On Wednesday, videos verified by BBC Persian showed crowds protesting in Qazvin, north-west of Tehran, and chanting slogans including "Death to the dictator" - a reference to Khamenei - as well as "Long live the shah". Footage from the Gulf port of Bandar Abbas, showed protesters chanting "Police force, support, support" before security forces disperse them. In the Shia holy city of Mashhad, in the country's north-west, protesters were seen clashing with security forces and forcing them to retreat. Another video showed people chanting in support of the Pahlavi dynasty, which was overthrown by the 1979 Islamic revolution. In the late afternoon, a large demonstration also took place in the south-western city of Abadan, near the border with Iraq, according to footage verified by BBC Persian, in which protesters chanted "Cannon, tanks, firecrackers! Mullahs must get lost", a reference to Iran's clerical leadership. More footage filmed from a balcony in the city appeared to show security forces opening fire as they run away from advancing protesters, who are throwing stones and other objects. As night fell, security forces were filmed firing tear gas to disperse a protest in Aligudarz, another western city, after a crowd had gathered in a square chanting "People's uprising, Viva!" In Lordegan, Fars reported that two police officers were killed during a protest on Wednesday. It added that the officers, whom it named as Hadi Azarsalim and Moslem Mahdavinasab, were shot dead by "armed individuals" who had been among a group of what it called "rioters". It was not immediately possible to verify the report because the BBC and other independent international media are either not allowed to report from inside Iran or, if granted permission, face severe restrictions on their movements. However, Lordegan has been the scene of violent clashes during the unrest, with two protesters killed there last Thursday. Following a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Vice-President for Executive Affairs Mohammad Jafar Qaempanah said President Masoud Pezeshkian had ordered that "no security measures" be taken against peaceful protesters. "Those who carry firearms, knives and machetes and who attack police stations and military sites are rioters, and we must distinguish protesters from rioters," he added. State media also reported that the government had begun paying 71 million citizens a new monthly allowance equivalent to $7 (£5) to ease the pain of the high cost of living. Meanwhile, judiciary chief Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei told police commanders that "rioters" would face "rapid" prosecution and punishment in order to serve as a deterrent. Khamenei - who, as supreme leader, has ultimate power in Iran - said on Saturday that authorities should "speak with the protesters" but that "rioters should be put in their place". His comments came after President Donald Trump threatened that the US would intervene if Iranian security forces killed peaceful protesters, saying: "We are locked and loaded." Dr Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East programme at the London-based think tank Chatham House, told the BBC that the protests had quickly become political and were being driven by deep-seated anger among the public. "People are fed up. They have no prospects for the future. Day-to-day life is becoming much more difficult," she said. "If there is more momentum and if more people come out, [the protests] will be more serious and, of course, there the government response becomes more violent." Sadegh Zibakalam, a political science professor at the University of Tehran, said the Iranian authorities might be resisting a harsher crackdown because of Trump's threats. "Some Iranian leaders - Revolutionary Guard commanders and security forces - maybe they are a bit more cautious and are not in a hurry to suppress the crowd this time fearing it may create an American intervention," he told the BBC. The protests have been the most widespread since an uprising in 2022 sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish woman who was detained by morality police for allegedly not wearing her hijab properly. More than 550 people were killed and 20,000 detained in a violent crackdown on those protests by security forces, according to human rights groups.

Trump withdraws US from key climate treaty and dozens of other groups US President Donald Trump has withdrawn the US from dozens of international organisations, including many that work to combat climate change. Among the 66 groups, nearly half of them are bodies of the United Nations, including the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change - a treaty that underpins all international efforts to combat global warming. The White House said the decision was taken because those entities "no longer serve American interests" and promote "ineffective or hostile agendas". Trump has already stripped many multilateral organisations he dislikes of funds and previously rejected the scientific consensus of man-made climate change as a "hoax". The memorandum was signed on Wednesday after a review into causes that the White House said were "a waste of taxpayer dollars". "These withdrawals will end American taxpayer funding and involvement in entities that advance globalist agendas over US priorities," it said in a statement. It added that many of the organisations promoted "radical climate policies, global governance and ideological programs that conflict with US sovereignty and economic strength". The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), an expert body that assesses climate science worldwide, was also included on the list. Other UN organisations affected included those working on peace and democracy, family planning, maternal and child health, and sexual violence in conflict. While the US Constitution allows presidents to join treaties "provided two thirds of Senators present concur", it does not specify what happens if they were to withdraw, which means Trump's move could face legal challenges. A member of a US-based non-profit advocacy group, the Union of Concerned Scientists, described the step as a "new low". Senior policy director Rachel Cleetus told AFP news agency it was another sign that the administration, which she described as "authoritarian" and "anti- science", was determined to sacrifice people's wellbeing and destabilise global cooperation. Last year, Trump once again withdrew the US from the Paris climate agreement - the world's most important effort to tackle rising temperatures - and declined to send a delegation to the COP30 climate summit in Brazil.

Cambodia extradites alleged scam mastermind to China after arrest Cambodia says it has extradited to China a billionaire businessman accused of masterminding a vast cryptocurrency scam in which trafficked workers were lured to forced labour camps to defraud victims globally. Chen Zhi was among three Chinese nationals arrested on 6 January after a joint investigation into transnational crime lasting several months, Cambodia said. The US charged the 37-year-old last October with running internet scams from Cambodia that it said had stolen billions in cryptocurrency. The UK also sanctioned his global business empire, Prince Group. Cambodian authorities have also suspended the operations of Prince Bank, a subsidiary of Prince Group. The bank has been placed under liquidation and banned from offering new banking services - though customers can still withdraw money and repay loans, the National Bank of Cambodia said on Thursday. Last year, US authorities seized about $15bn (£11bn) worth of bitcoin that it alleged belonged to Chen, in what FBI Director Kash Patel described as "one of the largest financial fraud takedowns in history". The BBC contacted Prince Group for comment at the time. In the past, the Cambodia-based group has denied any involvement in scams. Its website says its businesses include property development, and financial and consumer services. Since Chen Zhi was indicted by the US on fraud and money-laundering charges in October, his whereabouts have been unclear. But on Wednesday, the Cambodian authorities said they had "arrested three Chinese nationals namely Chen Zhi, Xu Ji Liang, and Shao Ji Hui and extradited [them] to the People's Republic of China". The interior ministry statement did not say where Chen Zhi had been detained. His Cambodian nationality had been revoked by royal decree last month, it added. The enigmatic tycoon had given up his Chinese nationality to become a Cambodian citizen in 2014. The UN estimates that hundreds of thousands of people have been trafficked to South East Asia, many of them to Cambodia, lured by the promise of legitimate jobs and then forced to run online scams. People are held against their will in the scam farms and made to defraud strangers online under the threat of punishment or torture. Many of those trapped are Chinese and targeted people in China. Chinese authorities have also been quietly investigating the Prince Group since at least 2020. The company is accused of running online fraud schemes in a number of court cases. The Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau established a task force to investigate the Prince Group, describing it as "a major transnational online gambling syndicate based in Cambodia". Cambodia's ruling elite have been close to Chen Zhi for years. The government has said little since the US and UK sanctioned Prince Group, apart from urging US and UK authorities to be sure they had sufficient evidence for their allegations. By some estimates, scam businesses may account for around half of the entire Cambodian economy. "I think it's the sheer scale of his operations which really makes Chen Zhi stand out," Jack Adamovic Davies, a journalist who has investigated Chen Zhi, told the BBC last year. He said it was shocking the Prince Group had been able to build a "global footprint" without raising alarm bells, given the serious criminal charges it now faces.

Heatwave hits Australia as officials warn of 'catastrophic' fire risk Parts of Australia will face catastrophic fire conditions on Friday, when heatwaves are expected to hit most of the country. Severe to extreme heatwaves have been declared in every state and territory in Australia, except for Queensland, with high temperatures forecast for days. The state of Victoria has declared a total fire ban for Friday, as the fire danger rating will be set at "catastrophic" - the highest level. Some 450 schools and childcare centres will be closed. One meteorologist told the BBC that the combination of heatwaves and an elevated fire danger in parts of the country could create the most "significant" conditions since the devastating Black Summer bushfires. On Thursday, firefighters battled several blazes in Victoria and New South Wales (NSW), with a dozen planes carrying water called in to tackle a large fire near the city of Wodonga, the ABC reported. Melbourne experienced its hottest day in six years on Wednesday with a high of 40.9C (105.6F), while some coastal towns in Western Australia hit 49C. In NSW, the heatwave is expected to peak on Saturday with Sydney facing a high of 42C while areas of South Australia and Western Australia will see temperatures over 40C in the coming days. Friday will be the "real peak of the current burst of heat," Angus Hines from the Bureau of Meteorology told the BBC. "It will be a very hot day for almost all of South Australia, Victoria, most of New South Wales, parts of Tasmania". Wednesday was the first significant heatwave for Melbourne and Adelaide, where millions of people live, with fire conditions set to worsen on Friday, he said. "Firstly, the winds are strengthening across Victoria tomorrow," Hines said, adding that coupled with possible thunderstorms with little rain and dry lightning strikes, the fire danger will hit catastrophic levels for the northern parts of Victoria. "This looks like the most significant event at a multi-day level for inland south-east Australia since 2019-2020," Hines said. That period six years ago saw Australia's most severe fire season on record, the so-called Black Summer where dozens of people died and thousands of hectares of land was burnt. In Victoria, authorities on Thursday warned that a catastrophic fire danger rating means potential blazes can be "unpredictable and uncontrollable". "We need the community to play their role alongside our emergency services to protect lives and property," said Victoria's Emergency Management Commissioner Tim Wiebusch. "Prepare now and enact your bushfire survival plan. If you are in an area of forecast catastrophic fire danger, leave early to an area with a lower fire risk." Australia's fire danger ratings scale has four levels, with catastrophic being the highest level, followed by extreme, high and low. A heatwave is declared when the minimum and maximum temperatures are expected to be unusually high for three days of more.

**Excerpt**

Australia PM announces royal commission into Bondi shooting Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has announced a royal commission, the country's most powerful form of independent inquiry, into last month's shooting at Bondi Beach. The attack targeting a Jewish festival left 15 people dead, making it one of the deadliest in the country's history. Albanese had previously argued that reforms on gun ownership and hate speech, steps to tackle antisemitism and a review into intelligence and law enforcement agencies offered the quickest response. But following weeks of public pressure, he said on Thursday that a royal commission was the best way forward after he had taken "the time to reflect" and meet with the Jewish community. "I've repeatedly said that our government's priority is to promote unity and social cohesion, and this is what Australia needs to heal, to learn, to come together in a spirit of national unity," he told reporters in Canberra. "It's clear to me that a royal commission is essential to achieving this." Since the 14 December attack, the families of the victims, as well as a chorus of public figures, including lawyers, business people and athletes had led an almost daily campaign calling for him to reverse course and launch a royal commission. A royal commission has broad powers to investigate, the ability to summon witnesses and compel agencies to produce documents. It can also offer legal protections to whistleblowers. The commission will examine four key areas, Albanese said. They comprise: investigating the "nature and prevalence of antisemitism" and its "key drivers" in Australia - making recommendations to enforcement, border immigration and security agencies to tackle antisemitism - examining the circumstances surrounding the Bondi attack - making any other recommendations for strengthening social cohesion and countering the spread of ideological and religiously motivated extremism - The prime minister said the work of Dennis Richardson, the former spy chief leading a review into intelligence and law enforcement agencies, would be wrapped into the royal commission, with an interim report expected in April. Former High Court justice Virginia Bell has been appointed to lead the commission, Albanese said, adding that he had asked her to report by December 2026 and that "this won't be a drawn-out process." Previous royal commissions have taken years. "This royal commission is the right format, the right duration and the right terms of reference to deliver the right outcome for our national unity and our national security," Albanese said. Rumours that Bell was to be appointed had earlier drawn criticism from the Jewish community. Former treasurer Josh Frydenberg said prior to Albanese's announcement the prime minister had been told by Jewish leaders there were "serious concerns" about her appointment, without specifying what they were. Speaking alongside Albanese, Attorney General Michelle Rowland said Bell was "an eminent and highly capable former Justice of the High Court of Australia, and I have no doubt that she will examine the complex issues ahead with impartiality and precision". Addressing concerns that a royal commission could interfere with the criminal legal proceedings against the alleged gunman who survived, Albanese added: "It's one of the reasons why we chose someone who has a criminal law background, has been in senior positions in the Supreme Court and the High Court of Australia. That is, she's the most qualified person we could possibly consider." He also added that the inquiry was not meant to "provide a solution on Gaza or on the Middle East". "The truth is that some people have held Jewish Australians to account for views or actions that that they're opposed to, that have nothing to do with them," Albanese said. In the days after the attack, state and federal leaders agreed to tighten gun controls, including limits on the number of firearms held by any one individual and on the types of firearms that can be held, as well as a buyback scheme. Albanese also promised hate speech reform including penalties for preachers and leaders who promote violence and a new federal offence of "aggravated hate speech". He previously said his government would adopt the recommendations put forward by antisemitism commissioner Jillian Segal in a July report. Her report was criticised by some upon its release due to its implications for free speech, such as plans to monitor universities and arts organisations and withhold funding if they were deemed to have failed to act against antisemitism. Speaking alongside the prime minister on Thursday, Segal said the government's decision was "the right one and an important one". "It does reflect the seriousness of the growth in antisemitism and its impact on our country and our democracy," she said.

Australia to deport British man over alleged neo-Nazi links A British man living in Western Australia is set to be deported over claims that he was part of a well-known neo-Nazi group. Ryan Turner's visa was cancelled on character grounds and he was taken into immigration detention on Tuesday. He can appeal the decision to cancel his visa or voluntarily return to the UK. Turner is understood to be a member of the National Socialist Network, the same group that organised an anti-Jewish rally outside the New South Wales parliament last year. Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said: "Our government has zero tolerance for bigotry and hate. If you don't like Australia, you can leave." The BBC has contacted the UK Foreign Office for comment. Last year, Australia tightened its hate crime laws, introducing mandatory jail terms for displaying hate symbols or performing a Nazi salute. In recent months, police have been cracking down on the use of these symbols amid fears of rising antisemitism and right wing extremism. Several foreign nationals with links to Nazi ideology have had their visas revoked including South African man Matthew Gruter who was detained last November. Gruter was also a part of the National Socialist Network and took part in the neo-Nazi rally outside the New South Wales parliament. It is unclear if Turner attended. Gruter was pictured in the front row of the rally along with about 60 other men, all clad in black, with a banner saying "abolish the Jewish lobby". Attendees also reportedly chanted "blood and honour", a slogan associated with the Hitler Youth, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). Gruter, who had lived in Australia since 2022 and worked as a civil engineer, returned to South Africa with his wife and young child, the ABC reported in early December. In another case, a British man living in Queensland was arrested and charged for allegedly using a social media account to post the Nazi swastika, promote pro-Nazi ideology and call for violence towards the Jewish community. Just before Christmas, the man who was identified in court documents as Kayn Adam Charles Wells, was placed in immigration detention in Brisbane after his visa was cancelled. He faced court earlier this week - where he is understood to have requested voluntary removal from Australia - with the case adjourned until February. Last month, days after two gunmen killed 15 people at a Jewish event at Bondi Beach, Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced a crackdown on hate speech with new laws to target "those who spread hate, division and radicalisation". The reforms also aim to give the home affairs minister new powers to cancel or refuse visas for those who spread hate.

**Excerpt**

Nick Reiner's lawyer removes himself from murder case A high-powered lawyer for Nick Reiner, who is charged with murdering his Hollywood director father Rob Reiner and mother Michele, has withdrawn from the case. It emerged that Alan Jackson would no longer represent Nick Reiner during a court hearing, though the attorney said afterwards that he believed his now-former client was innocent. Reiner, 32, did not enter a plea to charges of first-degree murder of his parents during a brief appearance at Los Angeles Superior Court. The Reiners were found dead with stab wounds on 14 December in the bedroom of their home in Brentwood, Los Angeles. Jackson said outside court after Wednesday's hearing that he had left the case. "Circumstances beyond my control, but more importantly circumstances beyond Nick's control, have made it impossible for us to continue our representation," he told reporters. "I'm legally and ethically prohibited from explaining the reasons why." The lawyer, who has previously represented Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey, added that Reiner was not guilty of murder. But LA County District Attorney Nathan Hochman said otherwise outside court. "We are fully confident that a jury will convict Nick Reiner beyond a reasonable doubt of the brutal murder of his parents - Rob Reiner and Michele Singer Reiner," said the prosecutor. The accused will now be represented in court by a public defender. To qualify for a publicly funded attorney, defendants must show they lack the means to fund their legal case. Rob Reiner's net worth was estimated at $200m (£150m) and it is unclear who was paying the retainer for his son's high-powered attorney. The accused has a brother and sister. When asked by the judge if he understood that he was waiving his right to enter a plea on Wednesday, Reiner said: "Yeah, I agree with it." The defendant smiled a few times during the hearing as he spoke to sheriffs' deputies. His new lawyer, public defender Kimberly Greene, met Reiner and asked for time to prepare for the case before her new client entered a plea. The next hearing is set for 23 February. Rob Reiner, 78, directed a handful of iconic films in a variety of genres, including This is Spinal Tap, Misery and A Few Good Men. Michele Singer Reiner, 70, was an actress, photographer and producer.

**Excerpt**

Trump actively discussing potentially buying Greenland, White House says US President Donald Trump and his officials are "actively" discussing a potential offer to buy the Danish territory of Greenland, the White House has confirmed. It is "something that's currently being actively discussed by the president and his national security team", White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Wednesday. Both Greenland and Denmark have repeatedly stressed the island was not for sale. Asked why the Trump administration had previously said it was not ruling out using military force to acquire Greenland, Leavitt replied that all options were always on the table but Trump's "first option always has been diplomacy". Concerns over the future of the territory resurfaced after Trump's unilateral use of military force against Venezuela on Saturday to seize its President Nicolás Maduro. Denmark, a fellow Nato ally, says an attack on its territory would end the military alliance. The Trump administration says Greenland is vital to US security. Despite being the most sparsely populated territory, its location between North America and the Arctic makes it well placed for early warning systems in the event of missile attacks, and for monitoring vessels in the region. Pituffik Space Base, formerly known as Thule Air Base, has been operated by the US since World War 2. In recent years, there has also been increased interest in Greenland's natural resources, including rare earth minerals, uranium and iron that are becoming easier to access as its ice melts due to climate change. Scientists think it could also have significant oil and gas reserves. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Wednesday that he will hold talks with Denmark next week. Trump previously made an offer to buy the island in 2019, during his first presidential term, only to be told it was not for sale. "The acquisition of Greenland by the United States is not a new idea," Leavitt said. "The president has been very open and clear with all of you and with the world, that he views it in the best interest of the United States to deter Russian and Chinese aggression in the Arctic region, and so that's why his team is currently talking about what a potential purchase would look like." The White House said earlier this week that Trump had been discussing a range of options to acquire Greenland, including using military force. "All options are always on the table for President Trump as he examines what's in the best interests of the United States," Leavitt said. Earlier in the day, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot said Rubio had "ruled out the possibility of an invasion" of Greenland in a phone call with him. Barrot is due to discuss the Arctic island with his German and Polish counterparts later on Wednesday. On Tuesday, European leaders issued a joint statement rallying behind Denmark. "Greenland belongs to its people, and only Denmark and Greenland can decide on matters concerning their relations," the leaders of France, the UK, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain and Denmark said in a joint statement. Stressing they were as keen as the US on Arctic security, the European signatories said this must be achieved by Nato allies, including the US, "collectively". They also called for "upholding the principles of the UN Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders". A day after the US military action in Venezuela, Katie Miller, the wife of one of Trump's senior aides, posted a map on social media of Greenland in the colours of the US flag, alongside the word "SOON". On Monday, her husband, Stephen Miller, said it was "the formal position of the US government that Greenland should be part of the US". Aaja Chemnitz, one of two MPs in the Danish parliament representing Greenland, told the BBC that the comments from the Trump administration were "a clear threat". "It's completely disrespectful from the US side to not rule out annexing our country and to annex another Nato ally," she said. But Chemnitz said she saw this as unlikely - instead, "what we are going to see is that they will put pressure on us in order to make sure that they will take over Greenland over time". Aleqatsiaq Peary, a 42-year-old Inuit hunter living in Greenland's remote northerly town of Qaanaaq, appeared indifferent to the potential of US ownership. "It would be switching from one master to another, from one occupier to another," he told the BBC. "We are a colony under Denmark. We are already losing a lot from being under the Danish government." Saying that he did not have "time for Trump", he added that people were "in need". Hunters like him, he explained, hunted with dogs on the sea ice and fish "but the sea ice is melting and hunters cannot make a living anymore". Additional reporting by Adrienne Murray in Copenhagen

**Excerpt**

Trump to meet Colombian president at White House in 'near future' US President Donald Trump has said he will meet his Colombian counterpart Gustavo Petro at the White House in the "near future", just days after saying an operation targeting Colombia "sounds good". The US seized the president of neighbouring Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, in a raid on Caracas on Saturday night. Venezuelan Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello said on Wednesday the death toll in the raid was substantially higher than initially reported, with more than 100 people killed. Local media had previously reported that 23 Venezuelan and 32 Cuban soldiers died when US forces stormed Maduro's compound. During a call with Trump, Petro explained "the situation of drugs and other disagreements", the US president said, adding he appreciated the Colombian president's "tone". Earlier this week, Trump had issued a warning to Petro, telling him to "watch his ass". Colombia is a key hub for the region's drug trade - most notably cocaine - as well as having substantial oil reserves. It is also a major producer of gold, silver, emeralds, platinum and coal. The US has said it will control sales of Venezuelan oil "indefinitely" as it prepares to roll back restrictions on the country's crude in global markets, according to the White House. Speaking aboard Air Force One following the operation in Venezuela, Trump described Petro as a "sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States". Trump added: "He's not going to be doing it for very long." In response, Petro warned that Colombia would "take up arms" if the US launched any military action against his country. "If you detain a president whom much of my people want and respect, you will unleash the people's jaguar," Petro wrote on X. But writing on his Truth Social platform late on Wednesday, Trump described his conversation with Petro as a "Great Honor", and said US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and his Colombian counterpart would make arrangements for Petro to travel to Washington. The US imposed sanctions on Petro in October, saying he was failing to curb drug trafficking and was allowing cartels to "flourish". At the time, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that since Petro came to power in 2022, cocaine production in Colombia had "exploded to the highest rate in decades, flooding the United States and poisoning Americans". Petro responded he had been fighting drug trafficking "for decades" and that his administration had stemmed the growth of coca crops. Like Venezuela, Colombia is home to substantial oil reserves. Meanwhile, Venezuela's interim president Delcy Rodríguez said the US action to depose Maduro was a "stain on our relations such as had never occurred in our history". But she added: "Venezuela is open to energy relations where all parties benefit."

Analysis: Why Trump chose Maduro's VP over Nobel winner Amid the many questions swirling since last weekend's dramatic events in Caracas – and there are many – one that refuses to go away centres on the bespectacled woman now leading what US officials are calling Venezuela's "interim authorities." Why Delcy? What is it about Delcy Rodríguez, daughter of a former Marxist guerilla and deputy to ousted dictator Nicolas Maduro, that has caught the eye of the Trump administration? And why has Washington decided on an avowed "Chavista" revolutionary to stay in power, rather than backing the opposition leader, María Corina Machado, whose opposition movement is widely believed to have won the 2024 presidential elections? The answer, according to one former US ambassador to Venezuela, is simple. "They've gone for stability over democracy," says Charles Shapiro, who served as George W Bush's ambassador in Caracas from 2002-04. "They've kept the dictatorial regime in place without the dictator. The henchmen are still there." "I think it's risky as hell." But the alternative, involving wholesale regime change and backing Machado's opposition movement, would have involved other dangers, including potential infighting among opposition figures and the alienation of those Venezuelans – perhaps as many as 30% – who voted for Maduro. In his dramatic press conference on Saturday morning, President Trump shocked many observers by dismissing the Nobel Peace Prize winner Machado as "not respected" inside Venezuela, while describing Rodríguez as "gracious." "I was very surprised to hear the disqualification of María Corina Machado by President Trump," Kevin Whitaker, former deputy chief of mission at the US embassy in Caracas, says. "Her movement was massively elected…and so disqualifying Machado, in effect, disqualified that whole movement." The speed, and apparent ease, with which Maduro was removed and Rodríguez installed led some observers to speculate that the former vice president might have been in on the plan. "I think it's very telling that we just went after Maduro and the vice president survived," says former CIA officer Lindsay Moran. "It's obvious that there were high-placed sources. My immediate speculation was that those high placed sources were in the office of the VP, if not the VP herself." But Phil Gunson, a senior analyst with the International Crisis Group who lives in Caracas, says the conspiracy theory doesn't stand up to close scrutiny, given that enormous power still rests with Venezuela's defence minister, General Vladimir Padrino Lopez, and hardline interior minister, Diosdado Cabello, both loyal Maduro allies. "Why would she sell out Maduro, leaving her defenceless, internally, against the guys who really control the guns," Gunson says. Instead, the decision to back Rodríguez followed warnings that installing Machado could result in dangerous levels of instability. In October, an ICG report warned that "Washington should beware of regime change." "The risks of violence in any post-Maduro scenario should not be downplayed," the report urged, saying elements of the security forces could launch a guerilla war against the new authorities. Trump calls for US military spending to rise more than 50% to $1.5t - US seizes two 'shadow fleet' tankers linked to Venezuelan oil - Opposition leader Machado says her coalition should lead Venezuela - 'I'm a prisoner of war' - In the room for Maduro's dramatic court hearing - "We were warning people in the administration, this is not going to work," Gunson says. "There will be violent chaos, it will be your fault and you'll own it." On Monday, the Wall Street Journal reported the existence of a classified US intelligence assessment reaching the same conclusions and determining that members of the Maduro regime, including Rodríguez, were in a better position to lead a temporary government. The White House hasn't commented publicly on the report, but made it clear that it plans to work with Rodríguez for the foreseeable future. "It belies a bit of hard-nosed realism on the part of the Trump administration, says Henry Ziemer, an associate fellow with the Americas Program at Washington's Centre for Strategic and International Studies. But the challenges, he says, have only just begun. "The capture of Maduro was the easy part. The broader rebuilding of Venezuela, the oil, drugs and democracy goals…are going to take much more time to come to fruition. For now, though, Rodríguez seems to be someone the Trump administration feels it can deal with. "She's been a bit of an economic reformer," Gunson says. "She's aware of the need for an economic opening and she's not averse to the idea of bringing back foreign capital." Ziemer agrees that Rodríguez may not find it difficult to do Washington's bidding when it comes to rolling out the welcome mat for US oil companies, offering greater cooperation on counter-narcotics and even scaling down Venezuela's relations with Cuba, China and Russia, especially if it means the gradual lifting of US sanctions. "I think she can deliver on that," he says. "But if the US is asking for genuine progress towards a democratic transition, that becomes much harder." At the moment, this does not appear to be high on Washington's list of priorities. In remarks to the press on Wednesday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke of a three-stage plan for Venezuela, starting with stabilisation of the country and the marketing of 30-50 million barrels of oil under US supervision. The plan would lead to what Rubio called "a process of reconciliation", including amnesties for opposition forces, the release of political prisoners and the rebuilding of civil society. "The third phase, of course, will be one of transition," he said, without elaborating. Article 233 of Venezuela's constitution calls for fresh elections within 30 days of a president becoming "permanently unavailable to serve," something that would seem to apply to a situation in which Maduro languishes in a New York jail, awaiting trial. But in an interview with NBC News on Monday, President Trump said elections were not on the horizon. "We have to fix the country first," he said. "You can't have an election." Gunson says Washington's decision not to go for regime change in the short term might make sense, but the absence of a medium- or long-term prospect is disappointing. "Trump may be getting something out of this, but Venezuelans aren't," he says. "Ordinary Venezuelans are getting screwed as usual." With the Trump administration talking up the prospects of international oil companies re-investing in Venezuela's corrupt and moribund petroleum infrastructure, Gunson says reality may be more complicated. "Nobody's going to come in here with the tens of billions of dollars that are required…to start the recovery process if the government is illegitimate and there's no rule of law," he says. When the former Venezuelan leader Hugo Chávez designated Nicolás Maduro as his successor, shortly before his death in 2013, the move was described as Chavez's "dedazo," a Spanish slang term meaning a "finger pointing," a personal anointment which bypasses the normal democratic process. Ambassador Shapiro sees a parallel with the rise to power of Delcy Rodríguez. "This is Trump's dedazo," he says.

Children in Gaza return to school after years without formal education In Gaza City, the sound of children learning can be heard once again. The tents that now serve as classrooms are noisy and a little chaotic but lively. Some teachers point to boards covered in English letters; others invite pupils to come forward and write basic Arabic words. It is nowhere near a normal school day. But after the Israel-Hamas ceasefire in October, it's a start. After two years of war, the hum of lessons and chatter of classmates resonates around the ruins of what was once Lulwa Abdel Wahab al-Qatami School, in the Tel al-Hawa neighbourhood in the south-western part of Gaza City. It was hit in January 2024, and for months afterwards, its grounds served as a shelter for displaced families. Today, it is again a place of learning - albeit in a more basic form. Walking in a straight line, their small arms resting on each other's shoulders, pupils smile as they head into the makeshift classrooms. For many, this is the first return to routine and education since the war began. According to Unicef, more than 97% of schools in Gaza were damaged or destroyed during the war. The IDF has made repeated claims that Hamas uses civilian infrastructure including schools to carry out operations but has rarely provided solid evidence. Of the Strip's 658,000 school-aged children, most have had no formal education for nearly two years. During that time, many learned first-hand how hunger, displacement and death can shape their young lives. Now, something rare is emerging: a fragile glimpse of the childhoods they once knew. Fourteen-year-old Naeem al-Asmaar used to attend this school before it was destroyed. He lost his mother in an Israeli air strike during the war. "It was the hardest thing I've ever been through," he says quietly. Although he was displaced for months, Naeem's home in Gaza City survived. After the ceasefire, he returned with his family. "I missed being in school a lot," Naeem said adding that the difference is stark. "Before the war, school was in real classrooms," "Now it's tents. We only study four subjects. There isn't enough space. The education is not the same - but being here matters. School fills all my time and I really needed that." Rital Alaa Harb, a ninth-grade student who once studied here too, wants to become a dentist. "Displacement affected my education completely," she says. "There was no time to study. No schools. I missed my friends so much - and I miss my old school." The makeshift school is run by Unicef and brings together children from the original Lulwa school and others displaced by the war. It does not teach the full Palestinian curriculum - only the basics: Arabic, English, mathematics and science. The principal, Dr Mohammed Saeed Schheiber, has worked in education for 24 years. He took over management of the site in mid-November. "We started with determination," he said, "to compensate students for what they lost." The school currently serves 1,100 boys and girls, operating in three shifts a day - with boys attending on alternating days from girls. There are just 24 teachers. "Before the war," Dr Schheiber says, "our students learned in fully equipped schools - science labs, computer labs, internet access, educational resources. All of that is gone." There is no electricity here. No internet. And many children are struggling with trauma. More than 100 students at the school lost one or both parents, had their homes destroyed, or witnessed killings during the war. In total, Dr Schheiber says, every student has been affected - directly or indirectly. A counsellor now runs psychological support sessions, trying to help children process what they have endured. Despite the effort, demand far exceeds capacity. "We have more than a thousand students here already," Dr Schheiber says. "But only six classrooms per shift. There is a large displacement camp next to the school - families from northern and eastern Gaza. Many children want to enrol. We simply cannot take them." For parents, the return to school brings relief as well as anxiety. Huda Bassam al-Dasouki, a mother of five displaced from southern Rimal, says education has become an overwhelming challenge. "It's not that education doesn't exist," she says. "It's that it's extremely difficult." Even before the war, schools struggled with shortages, she says. Now, basic supplies are unaffordable or unavailable. "A notebook that cost one shekel ($0.31; £0.23) before the war now costs five," she says. "I have five children." Some children, she says, have fallen four years behind, including time lost during the Covid pandemic. "My son can't read. He can't write. He doesn't know how to copy from the board," she says. Unicef says the situation is made worse by restrictions on aid supplies entering Gaza. Standing outside one of the school tents, Jonathan Crickx, a Unicef spokesman, points to what is missing. "Paper, notebooks, pens, erasers, rulers... we've been asking for a long time that these supplies can enter the Gaza Strip and they haven't been allowed in. It's the same for mental health and psychosocial recreative kits - toy kits that can be used to do mental health activities and recreational activities with the children," he says. An Israeli security official referred us to the prime minister's office, which did not respond to the BBC's questions. Israel says it is meeting its obligations under the ceasefire deal with Hamas and facilitating increased aid deliveries. The UN and multiple aid agencies dispute that, accusing Israel of continuing to restrict access to essential supplies. Despite the ceasefire, Israel's bombardment of Gaza continues - with almost daily strikes - in response to what it says are Hamas violations of the deal. Still, the children keep coming. For Kholoud Habib, a teacher at the school, that determination is telling. "Education is our foundation," she says. "As Palestinians, it is our capital. "We lose homes. We lose money. We lose everything," she adds. "But knowledge - knowledge is the one investment we can still give our children."

**Excerpt**

'We are not for sale': Greenlanders express fear and indignation as Trump eyes territory "The people of Greenland do not want to become American," Mia Chemnitz tells the BBC. "We are not for sale." The 32-year-old business owner in the Greenlandic capital Nuuk reflects the sentiments of many who spoke to the BBC about how they felt about recent rhetoric from the Trump administration. The White House has said it was "actively" discussing an offer to buy the territory that has for centuries belonged to Denmark. US President Donald Trump and his officials had earlier intimated a willingness to take it by force if necessary. This has been met with nervousness and opprobrium among Greenlanders - both on the world's largest island and elsewhere. This nervousness has only grown since the US took Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro from his residence in Caracas to New York on drug-trafficking and narco-terrorism charges in an unprecedented military move. Almost immediately after, the wife of a senior White House staffer indicated that Greenland was next. "That's when it stopped feeling abstract," says Tupaarnaq Kopeck, 40, who moved to Canada - another place Trump has threatened to annex - for family and work. "For the first time, I contacted my sister in Greenland and told her that if the unthinkable ever became reality, they would have a place to stay with us." Aaja Chemnitz, one of two MPs in the Danish parliament representing Greenland, says the comments from the Trump administration are "a clear threat" that she was "appalled" by. "It's completely disrespectful from the US side to not rule out annexing our country and to annex another Nato ally," she says. Greenland is the world's most sparsely populated territory. With much of the Arctic island covered by ice, most of the population lives in Nuuk and the surrounding south-western coastline. But it is strategically significant to the US - which is why it has had a military presence there since World War Two. Greenland's location between North America and the Arctic makes it well placed for early warning systems in the event of missile attacks. More recently, there has also been increased interest in Greenland's natural resources, including rare earth minerals, which are becoming easier to access as its ice melts due to climate change. "It's not fun being 56,000 people and having these threats - if you can call them that - from a giant like the US," says Masaana Egede, editor of Greenlandic newspaper Sermitsiaq. "The citizens of Greenland are nervous about this, because this is not something that we take lightly." Experts generally agree that a military takeover of Greenland would be an easy undertaking for the US - but that the geopolitical fallout would effectively end the Nato alliance. After the issue of Greenland's ownership was raised anew by the White House, six European allies issued a statement saying its future should be decided by its people - something Mia says she is grateful for. But she worries this will matter little to the US "if it's not backed with consequences and actions". "As a Greenlander, I can't help but wonder: what are we worth to these allies? To what lengths are they willing to go to protect us?" Tupaarnaq says: "Respect is about more than alliances on paper. When powerful nations talk about you instead of with you, that respect disappears very quickly." The Trump administration has stressed its intention was to buy Greenland from Denmark - despite Copenhagen reiterating the territory was not for sale - while retaining a military intervention as an option. Aaja sees annexation by force as unlikely - instead, "what we are going to see is that they will put pressure on us in order to make sure that they will take over Greenland over time". Polling consistently shows that Greenlanders generally favour eventual independence from Denmark but oppose being owned by the US. The territory is largely self-governing, with control of foreign affairs and defence retained by Copenhagen. This is perhaps why Aleqatsiaq Peary, a 42-year-old Inuit hunter living in the remote northerly town of Qaanaaq, seemed unfazed by the prospect of US ownership. "It would be switching from one master to another, from one occupier to another," he says. "We are a colony under Denmark. We are already losing a lot from being under the Danish government." But he says: "I don't have time for Trump. Our people are in need," explaining hunters like him hunt with dogs on the sea ice and fish, "but the sea ice is melting and hunters cannot make a living anymore". For Sermitsiaq editor Masaana, the rhetoric from the US is pushing a fallacious binary choice. "We really have to try to avoid getting the story going to a place where it's Greenland that has to decide between the US and Denmark, because that is not the choice that the Greenlandic people want." For others, who see the strong relationship Greenland already has with the US being soured, there is a clear sense of indignation. "People in Greenland are getting really irritated with this," says Christian Keldsen of the Greenland Business Association. "Greenlanders are welcoming and open-hearted, it's the best thing about the country. But now with this, some people are scared." Greenland is open for business with the US, Christian stresses, noting that there are new direct flights from Greenland to New York - a sure sign "they don't need to take us over". "We are a well-functioning democracy and our government has a strong mandate," Mia says. "We are a Nato ally and the US has had military bases in Greenland for over 70 years - and still has the right to establish and run new and more. "As it has been stated from Greenland before: we are not for sale, but we're open for business."
