**Excerpt**

S Korea's ex-president Yoon to be jailed for five years over martial law bid South Korea's impeached president Yoon Suk Yeol will be jailed for five years over abuse of power, obstructing justice and falsifying documents in relation to his failed martial law bid in 2024. This is the first of the verdicts in four trials linked to his shock martial law decree. Although short-lived, the move triggered nationwide turmoil, sparking protests as MPs rushed to the national assembly to overturn Yoon's decision. Yoon's actions "plunged the country into political crisis", a judge said on Friday, noting that Yoon had "consistently shown no remorse". Friday's ruling offers clues as to how the rest of Yoon's trials could go. His string of charges range from abuse of power to campaign law violations. The most serious charge is insurrection, for which prosecutors have demanded the death penalty. The verdict in that trial is expected in February. About 100 supporters of Yoon had gathered outside the courthouse on Friday to watch the livestreamed proceedings projected on a large screen. Some of them held red banners that read: "Yoon, again! Make Korea great again". Several could be heard yelling at the judge as he delivered the guilty verdicts, while others looked solemn. On Friday, Yoon was convicted of using presidential bodyguards to prevent his arrest; failing to consult his entire cabinet before declaring martial law; as well as drafting and then destroying a falsified document claiming the martial law bid had been endorsed by the prime minister and defence minister. "The accused has the duty to safeguard the constitution and law but turned his back on them," the judge said. Prosecutors had sought a 10-year jail term for the charges in Friday's ruling. Both sides have seven days to appeal. Yoon denied the charges, arguing that the arrest warrant itself was invalid and that the letter of the law does not require him to consult every member of the cabinet before exercising emergency power. He had claimed across his trials that investigators had no legal basis to probe and arrest him in the first place. Most of the accusations against him are invalid because there was no procedural lapse when he declared martial law, he argues. South Korea's courts often grant leniency when the accused accepts guilt or responsibility. But prosecutors argue that Yoon's lack of remorse is grounds for an even more severe penalty. Park Geun-hye, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for abuse of power and bribery in 2021, was the last former president to be jailed for a criminal charge. But she was pardoned and released from prison shortly after. Six months after Yoon's martial law attempt, voters elected opposition leader Lee Jae Myung in a decisive victory . But Yoon's trials bring the spotlight back to deep divisions in South Korea, where the former president retains strong supporters who see him as a martyr. According to a survey conducted last December, nearly 30% of South Koreans did not believe that Yoon's martial law declaration amounted to an insurrection. While his martial law attempt brought tens of thousands of protesters onto the streets, it also saw his supporters show up in counter protests, though in smaller numbers.

Trump threatens to invoke Insurrection Act to quell anti-ICE protests in Minnesota US President Donald Trump has threatened to invoke the rarely used Insurrection Act to quell unrest over federal immigration enforcement operations in Minneapolis. He threatened to send in troops following a night of protests and vandalism in the Minnesota city after an agent shot a man in the leg. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said an officer opened fire after he was attacked by three Venezuelan nationals with a shovel and broom handle. Tensions have been running high in Minneapolis since an immigration agent fatally shot Renee Nicole Good, 37, last week, sparking nationwide protests. The Insurrection Act is a 19th Century law that allows active-duty military personnel to be deployed for law enforcement duties inside the US. Trump has previously said he might invoke the 1807 law elsewhere without ever doing so. The president posted on Truth Social that he would use the law if Minnesota officials failed to stop the "professional agitators and insurrectionists". DHS said Wednesday's shooting occurred after a car chase involving a Venezuelan national, Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis, who was previously convicted for driving without a licence. The agency statement said after the pursuit, Sosa-Celis got out of his vehicle and fought with the federal agent. Two more illegal immigrants from Venezuela, Alfredo Alejandro Ajorna and Gabriel Alejandro Hernandez-Ledezma, came out of a nearby apartment, according to the agency. All three attacked the law enforcement officer with a snow shovel and broom handle, DHS said, before the agent opened fire, hitting Sosa-Celis in the leg. The agent was taken to hospital. Sosa-Celis was also taken to hospital with non-life threatening injuries. All three Venezuelans were arrested. "What we saw last night in Minneapolis was an attempted murder of federal law enforcement," said DHS Secretary Kristi Noem. She said the officer was "ambushed and attacked" by the men and fired a defensive shot. On Wednesday night, clashes broke out between protesters and law enforcement in the Hawthorne area of Minneapolis, near the scene of the shooting. City police chief Brian O'Hara said his officers were hit by fireworks, ice and snowballs. Several vehicles belonging to the federal government were damaged in the disorder, and property was stolen from inside the vehicles, according to the FBI. The FBI said on Thursday that it was offering a reward of up to $100,000 for information leading to the "recovery of stolen government property and/or the arrest of individuals responsible for the destruction and theft of government property". Around 3,000 federal officers have been deployed to Minnesota in recent weeks. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, who has demanded ICE leave the city, said on X on Wednesday: "No matter what led up to this incident, the situation we are seeing in our city is not sustainable." Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, a Democrat, made a direct appeal to the president on Thursday posting on X: "Let's turn the temperature down." Walz, who has previously called ICE a "modern-day Gestapo", told Minnesotans: "We cannot fan the flames of chaos." The Democratic governor, who ran for US vice-president alongside Kamala Harris in the 2024 election, said earlier this month he would end his bid for re-election. The move came in the wake of a fraud scandal involving the state's welfare programmes. Trump has said Operation Metro Surge will continue in Minnesota after a federal judge on Wednesday denied Minnesota prosecutors a temporary restraining order against US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Tensions over immigration enforcement have been running high in the city since the fatal shooting on 7 January of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good by an ICE agent. The Trump administration says the ICE agent acted in self-defence, while local officials argue the woman posed no danger. Videos of the incident show ICE agents approaching a car, which is in the middle of the street. As Good attempts to drive off, one of them at the front of the vehicle points his gun at the driver and fires three shots. The FBI is investigating the incident. An online fundraiser set up for Good's widow and family has raised more than $1.4m. Another online fundraiser for Jonathan Ross, the ICE agent at the centre of the deadly confrontation, has raised $740,000. Do you have a question about Trump's first year back in office?

Landscape beneath Antarctica's icy surface revealed in unprecedented detail A new map has unmasked the landscape beneath Antarctica's ice in unprecedented detail, something scientists say could greatly enhance our understanding of the frozen white continent. Researchers used satellite data and the physics of how Antarctica's glaciers move to work out what the continent might look like beneath the ice. They found evidence of thousands of previously undiscovered hills and ridges, and say their maps of some of Antarctica's hidden mountain ranges are clearer than ever before. While the maps are subject to uncertainties, the researchers believe the new details could shed light on how Antarctica will respond to climate change - and what that means for sea-level rise. "It's like before you had a grainy pixel film camera, and now you've got a properly zoomed-in digital image of what's really going on," lead author Dr Helen Ockenden, a researcher at the University of Grenoble-Alpes, told BBC News. Thanks to satellites, scientists have a good understanding of Antarctica's icy surface – but what lies beneath has remained more of a mystery. In fact, more is known about the surface of some planets in our Solar System than much of Antarctica's "underbelly" – the topography beneath the ice sheet. But researchers now have what they believe to be the most complete, detailed map of that underbelly ever made. "I'm just so excited to look at that and just see the whole bed of Antarctica at once," said Prof Robert Bingham, a glaciologist at the University of Edinburgh who co-authored the study. "I think that's amazing." Traditional measurements from the ground or air have used radar to "see" beneath the ice - which is up to three miles (4.8km) thick in places - often along individual survey lines or tracks. But these tracks could be tens of kilometres apart - leaving scientists to fill in the gaps. “If you imagined the Scottish Highlands or the European Alps were covered by ice and the only way to understand their shape was the occasional flight several kilometres apart, there's no way that you would see all these sharp mountains and valleys that we know to be there,” said Bingham. So the researchers used a new approach, combining their knowledge of the ice surface from satellites and their understanding of how the ice moves from physics - and checking them against those previous tracks. “It’s a little bit like if you're kayaking in a river, and there's rocks underneath the water, sometimes there's eddies in the surface, which can tell you about the rocks under the water,” explained Ockenden. “And ice obviously flows very differently to water, but still, when the ice is flowing over a ridge or a hill in the bedrock […] that manifests in the topography of the surface, but also in the velocity as well.” While we knew about Antarctica's major mountain ranges, the scientists' new approach has revealed tens of thousands of previously undiscovered hills and ridges, as well as greater details around some of those mountains and canyons buried under the ice. "I think it's just really super interesting to look at all these new landscapes and see what's there," said Ockenden. "It's like when you see a map of topography on Mars for the first time, and you're like, 'whoa, this is so interesting, this looks a bit like Scotland,' or 'this looks like nothing I've ever seen before'." One intriguing discovery is a deep channel incised in Antarctica's bed in an area called the Maud Subglacial Basin. The channel is on average 50m deep, 6km wide and runs for nearly 400km (about 250 miles) - roughly the distance from London to Newcastle as the crow flies. The researchers’ new map is unlikely to be the final one. It relies on assumptions about exactly how ice flows which, like any method, comes with uncertainties. And much remains to be discovered about the rocks and sediments that lie beneath the ice. But other researchers agree that, combined with further surveys from the ground, air and space, the maps are a valuable step forward. "This is a really useful product," said Dr Peter Fretwell, senior scientist at the British Antarctic Survey in Cambridge, who was not involved in the new study but has been extensively involved in previous mapping. "It gives us an opportunity to fill in the gaps between those surveys," he added. A more detailed understanding of all of the ridges, hills, mountains and channels could improve computer models of how Antarctica might change in future, the researchers say. That is because these landforms and features ultimately shape how fast the glaciers above move, and how quickly they can retreat in a warming climate. And that is important because the future speed of melting in Antarctica is widely considered to be one of the biggest unknowns in climate science. “[This study gives] us a better picture of what's going to happen in the future and how quickly ice in Antarctica will contribute to global sea-level rise,” agreed Fretwell. The study is published in the academic journal, Science.

**Excerpt**

Actor Timothy Busfield charged with sexually abusing boys on set of TV series Actor Timothy Busfield has made his first court appearance after turning himself in on criminal charges that he allegedly sexually abused two boys on the set of a TV series filmed in New Mexico, prosecutors say. The Emmy-winning actor, who starred in Thirtysomething and The West Wing, was taken into custody in Albuquerque on two counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor and one count of child abuse that police allege happened on the set of Fox's crime drama The Cleaning Lady. Busfield, 68, strenuously denied the allegations through his lawyer. "The claims being made against Tim are completely false, and we will fight this to the end until the truth prevails," the lawyer, Stanton "Larry" Stein, said. Stein said the actor, who is also known for his roles in the baseball film Field of Dreams and the comedy thriller Revenge of the Nerds, was being accused as an act of revenge after the children had been terminated from the series, which angered their mother. During a media conference on Thursday, Bernalillo County District Attorney Sam Bregman said that Busfield made an initial court appearance on Wednesday and a judge ordered that he remain in custody. The case is now being transferred to district court and a hearing has been set for 20 January to determine whether Busfield should be released on bail pending trial. "Our priority is to protect the rights of everyone involved," Bregman said at the news conference, urging anyone with information to contact law enforcement. In a warrant for Busfield's arrest, prosecutors say the parents of boys allege that Busfield groomed and sexually abused the youngsters while working on set for The Cleaning Lady, which Busfield both directs and executive produces. It airs on Fox in the US. In an affidavit supporting his arrest warrant, authorities claim the boys referred to Busfield as "Uncle Tim" and alleged that he "would tickle them on the stomach and legs". Both boys told authorities they were touched inappropriately for years, the arrest affidavit states. One of the boys alleged that Busfield touched his private areas, according to court documents. The boy told authorities that the alleged inappropriate touching started when he was 7 years old and he was scared to speak out because he "feared" that Busfield would "get mad at him". The documents state that the boy had suffered nightmares and was having troubles wetting the bed since the alleged encounters. He has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety, authorities say in the court documents. Before he turned himself in, Busfield appeared in a video provided to TMZ saying that he was contacted on Friday night about getting a lawyer. The next day he drove 2,000 miles (3,200 km) to Albuquerque, New Mexico, to surrender to authorities. "They're all lies and I did not do anything to those little boys and I'm gonna fight it. I'm gonna fight it with a great team, and I'm gonna be exonerated, I know I am, because this is all so wrong and all lies," he said in the video. His lawyer says the case stems from wanting revenge. Busfield told authorities that the boys' mother had threatened revenge when they were replaced on the series, the arrest affidavit states. "As reflected in the criminal complaint, after her son was terminated from the show, the boy's mother vowed to 'get her revenge against Timothy Busfield.' What followed appears to be a calculated effort to construct a case, driven by animus not fact, despite prior investigations finding no evidence of wrongdoing," Stein said. Stein added that an investigation opened by Warner Bros about the allegations was closed after they could not find "corroborating evidence that Mr Busfield engaged in inappropriate conduct or that he was ever alone" with the boys. Court documents show that after authorities got a warrant for his arrest, another accusation surfaced alleging Busfield kissed and groped a 16-year-old girl. Prosecutors noted the new allegation in a motion asking that a judge keep Busfield from being released from jail immediately, alleging the actor has a "documented pattern of sexual misconduct, abuse of authority and grooming behavior". In that court document, prosecutors said the girl's father had come forward on Tuesday with allegations that the teen had been sexually abused by Busfield in California "several years ago" at the B-Street Theatre, which the actor co-founded in Sacramento. The father alleged to authorities that the encounter happened when the girl was auditioning at the theatre and the actor allegedly kissed her and touched her sexually, the court document states. Court documents state that the father alleged that the actor "begged the family to not report to law enforcement" and agreed to go to therapy. Busfield's lawyer told the BBC that the actor denies all the allegations and "maintains that they are completely false". When asked about the additional accusation surfacing, Stein said Busfield had volunteered to do a polygraph test and had passed it. The lawyer did not provide further details on the test. Busfield has previously been accused of sexual assault by two women in the 1990s and in 2012, which prosecutors pointed to in court documents. The Cleaning Lady producer Warner Bros Television and Fox said that they were aware of the charges against Busfield and would work with law enforcement. They told the Los Angeles Times that they prioritise the health and safety of their cast and crew. A spokesperson for Busfield's wife Melissa Gilbert, who starred in the series Little House on the Prairie, told the BBC that she would not make public statements and pushed back against fake comments circulating online that claim to have come from her. "She is honoring the request of Tim's lawyers not to speak publicly while the legal process unfolds," her publicist Ame Van Iden said. "During this period, her focus is on supporting and caring for their very large family, as they navigate this moment. Melissa stands with and supports her husband and will address the public at an appropriate time. We ask that their privacy be respected."

**Excerpt**

Museveni takes strong lead in early results of Uganda presidential race Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni has taken a strong lead in provisional results from Thursday's presidential election, the electoral agency says. The results announced on Friday morning put Museveni in the lead with 76% of the votes, based on results from 45% of the country's polling stations. He is followed by opposition leader Bobi Wine with about 20%. Ugandans voted in a tense national election on Thursday after an often violent campaign, with President Museveni, 81, seeking a seventh term in office. Wine, a 43-year-old pop star-turned-politician, has alleged "massive" fraud during the election, which was held under an internet blackout. He did not provide documentary proof and the authorities have not responded to his allegations. Late on Thursday, Wine's National Unity Platform (NUP) party said that the military and police had surrounded his house in the capital, Kampala, "effectively placing him and his wife under house arrest". "Security officers have unlawfully jumped over the perimeter fence and are now erecting tents within his compound," the party posted on X. The authorities are yet to comment. Following the 2021 election, in which he garnered 35% of the vote, Wine was confined to his home for several days by security forces. During Thursday's vote, voting was delayed by up to four hours in many polling stations around the country as ballot boxes were slow to arrive and biometric machines, used to verify voters' identity, did not work properly. Some have linked the problems to the network outage. Although there are other six candidates, the presidential poll is essentially a two-horse race between Museveni and Wine, but given the president has won the six previous elections, analysts say he is likely to further extend his time in power. Wine, who says he represents the youth in a country where most of the population is aged under 30, has promised to tackle corruption and impose sweeping reforms, while Museveni argues he is the sole guarantor of stability and progress in the country. The campaign period was marred by the disruption of opposition activities - security forces have been accused of assaulting and detaining Wine's supporters. Police spokesperson Kituuma Rusoke dismissed these complaints, accusing opposition supporters of being disruptive. Internet access was suspended on Tuesday, with Uganda's Communications Commission saying the blackout was necessary to prevent misinformation, fraud and the incitement of violence - a move condemned by the UN human rights office as "deeply worrying". Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, had called on his supporters to protest, if Thursday's election results were manipulated. However, as of Friday morning, there have been no signs of any demonstrations. A Museveni victory would extend the former rebel leader's four-decade grip on power. He is widely believed to favour his son, military chief Muhoozi Kainerugaba, as his successor, though he denies grooming him for the role. The final presidential result are expected be announced by 16:00 local time (13:00 GMT) on Saturday, according to the electoral commission.

**Excerpt**

Cuba counts cost of alliance after 32 troops killed in Venezuela From sunrise, throngs of military personnel, government officials and civilians lined the route between Havana's airport and the Armed Forces Ministry to applaud home the remains of 32 Cuban troops killed in Venezuela as they passed by in a funeral cortege. The country's leadership – from Raul Castro to President Miguel Diaz Canel – were at the airport to receive the boxes carrying the cremated ashes of their "32 fallen heroes". In the lobby of the ministry building, each box was draped in a Cuban flag and set next to a photograph of the respective soldier or intelligence officer beneath the words "honour and glory". But despite the pomp and full military honours, this has been a chastening experience for the Cuban Revolution. First, it is believed to be the biggest loss of Cuban combatants at the hands of the US military since the Bay of Pigs invasion in April 1961. The fact that six-and-a-half decades have passed with barely a comparable firefight between Cuban and US troops, either during the Cold War or afterwards, shows how rare it is. It is not necessarily surprising that the better-trained and better-equipped Delta Force soldiers emerged virtually unscathed, especially given their elite reputation within the most powerful military in the world. But that is of no comfort to the grieving family members as they tearfully placed their hands on the wooden boxes in Havana. Furthermore, in the days after the US military intervention in Venezuela and the forced removal of Nicolas Maduro from power, the Cuban Government was obliged to admit something it had long denied: the very existence of Cuban intelligence officers inside the corridors of power in Caracas. It is now clear, as it had been claimed for years by many in Venezuela, that Cubans have been present at every level of the country's security apparatus and that the bilateral intelligence arrangements were a crucial part of Cuba-Venezuela ties. In short, the Cuban Government has shared its years of experience of how best to maintain an iron grip on power with its Venezuelan partners. The 32 killed on Venezuelan soil were part of that shared strategy. In the wake of their deaths, though, Cubans can feel the sands shifting beneath their feet. A day earlier, Venezuela's interim president, Delcy Rodriguez, held a phone call with President Trump, after which he described her as "a terrific person". Rewind the clock just three weeks and it would have been almost unthinkable to hear such praise from the same administration who painted her predecessor as running an entire regime of "narco-terrorists." It seems the Rodriguez and the Trump administrations are finding a modus vivendi. But few in the Cuban government seem to yet understand where that will leave them or their shared vision of state-run socialism with Venezuela. Washington insists the days are numbered for the Cuban Revolution. However, one of its "original generation" disagrees. At 88 years old, Victor Dreke is a contemporary of Fidel Castro and Che Guevara, and says the current conflict with the US has echoes of the CIA-backed invasion at the Bay of Pigs in April 1961. He led two companies of Cuban troops that day and argues that Cubans would still repel any repeat attempt: "If the US tries to invade, they'll stir up a hornets' nest" he said, quoting Raul Castro. "They'd never even see our combatants coming, men and women." "If the Americans put a single foot on Cuban soil, it won't be like their cowardly ambush of our combatants in Venezuela", he says. "Out here, things would be very different." In the past few days, Cuban state television has shown images of civilian reservists receiving weapons training from the Cuban military. In truth, pitted against the US military, it would be an uneven fight. The US attack on Venezuela was intended, in part, to underscore that point to the region. The stakes for Cuba are particularly high. The island is experiencing widespread blackouts which are bad in Havana but much worse in the provinces. The economy, battered by the US economic embargo and by government mismanagement, is limping along at best. Fuel is scarce and the motor of the economy, tourism, has never recovered to its pre-pandemic levels. It's into that already-complex picture that Cubans are trying to imagine the near total loss of Venezuelan support. It feels to most like a bleak scenario. But former-commander, Victor Dreke, is adamant that Cuba has ridden out tough times before and can do so again with enough revolutionary fervour. Cuba doesn't want any conflict with Trump administration, he insists, and won't be looking to escalate matters with Washington. "But that doesn't mean we won't be ready", he adds, defiantly.

Famed safari park shuts as deadly floods strike South Africa Flooding in South Africa's northern provinces of Limpopo and Mpumalanga has forced the famed Kruger National Park to suspend visits and evacuate some guests and staff by helicopter. At least 19 people are now believed to have died in recent weeks in South Africa due to floods caused by torrential rain. Among those killed was a five-year-old boy in the town of Giyani, in Limpopo. President Cyril Ramaphosa met the child's family to offer his condolences while visiting the region to assess the damage. A red level 10 warning has been issued by the South African Weather Service, forecasting yet more rain in affected areas and warning communities to remain alert. "If possible stay indoors and off the roads," it advises. "Never drive on a road covered by water. If the vehicle stalls, leave it immediately and seek higher ground." Residents are also advised to move their valuables to a "safe place above the expected flood level", switch off their electricity at the source, and to move livestock to higher ground. In recent days helicopters and the military have been deployed to rescue people in some of the worst-affected areas. The Reuters news agency reports that flooding in south-eastern Africa has become more frequent and severe as climate change makes storms in the adjacent Indian Ocean more powerful.

**Excerpt**

Woman who accused high-profile twins of sexual assault found dead in Australia The first woman to publicly accuse high-profile twins Oren and Alon Alexander of sexual assault was found dead in Australia late last year, according to new reports. Kate Whiteman sued the men in March 2024, alleging they sexually assaulted her in the state of New York in 2012. Months later they were arrested alongside their older brother and charged with sex trafficking offences. An investigation into the death of Whiteman, 45, by the New South Wales coroner's office has now concluded, finding her death was not suspicious. The Alexander brothers - who deny wrongdoing and have pleaded not guilty to the criminal charges - will face trial at the end of this month. The coroner's office said they could not provide any further information about Whiteman's death, out of consideration for bereaved family members. It is unclear what role, if any, Whiteman was due to play in the prosecution case. The BBC has contacted prosecutors for comment. A PR representative for the Alexander brothers said they were unaware of Whiteman's death. "The decision to release this information publicly on the eve of trial invites obvious questions," they said. Older brother, Tal, and Oren Alexander have worked for real estate giant Douglas Elliman, listing properties for celebrities including Liam Gallagher, Lindsay Lohan, Kim Kardashian and Kanye West. In 2022, they founded their own New York-based firm called Official. Alon worked at the family's private security firm, Kent Security. A day after Whiteman made her accusations, a second woman, Rebecca Mandel, also brought a lawsuit against Oren and Alon, alleging that the pair drugged and assaulted her at a party in 2010. In the following months, a series of other women came forward to news publications with accusations of sexual assault against all three brothers. Many also claimed they were drugged. As of February 2025, the New York Times said that at least 17 women had filed civil lawsuits against one or more of the brothers, with accusations of assault in Miami, Manhattan and even Moscow. All allegations have been denied by all three Alexander brothers. In their initial indictment, prosecutors alleged that from at least 2010, the three brothers "worked together and with others to engage in sex trafficking, including by repeatedly drugging, sexually assaulting, and raping dozens of female victims". At their arraignment in February 2025, prosecutors told the judge they intended to update their case with additional alleged victims, saying they had interviewed more than 60 women who say at least one of the brothers raped them. An attorney for one of the brothers told BBC partner CBS the charges were an "overreach" by the government and "in no way" amounted to sex trafficking. "We have no doubt the evidence will prove that these are all false allegations and the Alexanders are innocent," they said. They have been held without bail in Brooklyn's Metropolitan Detention Centre for the past 13 months, with their trial is set to begin on 26 January.

'Baby, don't move': Australian woman wakes to find massive python on her chest In the middle of the night on Monday, Rachel Bloor stirred in her bed to find a heavy weight curled up on her chest. Half asleep, she reached out for her dog - and instead found herself petting a smooth, slithering object. As Bloor retreated further under the covers and pulled them up to her neck, her partner switched on the bedside lamp and confirmed the Brisbane couple's fears. "He goes, 'Oh baby. Don't move. There's like a 2.5m python on you," Bloor told the BBC. Her first words were expletives. The second, an order to evacuate the dogs. "I thought if my Dalmatian realises that there's a snake there... it's gonna be carnage." The dogs secured outside the room - and her husband wishing he was with them - Bloor began carefully extricating herself. "I was just trying to shimmy out from under the covers... in my mind, going, 'Is this really happening? This is so bizarre'." She believes the carpet python - which is non-venomous - had squeezed itself through the shutters on her window and onto her bed below. Once freed from the python, she began casually feeding it back out the way it came in. "It was that big that even though it had been curled up on me, part of its tail was still out the shutter." "I grabbed him, [and] even then he didn't seem overly freaked out. He sort of just wobbled in my hand." The same couldn't be said for her stunned husband, but Bloor herself was barely fazed, having grown up on acreage around snakes. "I think if you're calm, they're calm." Though if it had been a cane toad - one of the country's most damaging, and ugly pests - that would be another story, she said. "I can't stand them, like they make me dry retch. So if it was a cane toad, it would have scared me." All animals and humans escaped from the interaction unharmed. Carpet pythons are constrictors that are common in coastal areas of Australia, and usually eat small animals such as birds.

**Excerpt**

Israel moves Yellow Line deeper into Gaza, satellite images show Israel has moved the blocks which are supposed to mark its post-ceasefire line of control deeper into Gaza in several places, sowing confusion among Palestinians. Satellite images reviewed by BBC Verify show that in at least three areas Israel placed blocks, before returning later and moving the positions further into the Strip. Under the terms of the US-brokered deal with Hamas, Israel agreed to withdraw troops beyond a line marked in yellow on Israeli military maps, which it has illustrated on the ground with concrete yellow blocks. Defence Minister Israel Katz warned in October that anyone crossing the Yellow Line would be "met with fire". Since these comments were made, there have been a series of deadly incidents around the line. In Beit Lahia, Jabalia and al-Tuffah, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) placed blocks and later returned to move them deeper inside Gaza. In total, 16 positions were moved. In the al-Tuffah neighbourhood of Gaza City, satellite images show that IDF troops moved at least seven already placed blocks between 27 November and 25 December. The position of the markers were moved on average 295m (968ft) deeper inside the Strip. As well as the blocks that have been moved, BBC Verify mapped 205 other markers. More than half of those have been placed significantly deeper inside the Strip than the line marked on maps. An IDF spokesperson said it rejected "all claims that the Yellow Line has been moved or its crossing by IDF troops". "The IDF is operating to visually mark the Yellow Line in accordance with the conditions on the ground and the ongoing operational situational assessment," they added. Analysis of satellite images up to 11 January suggests some sections of the Yellow Line - which the head of Israel's military described as a "new border line" - also remain unmarked on the ground more than three months since the ceasefire began. The latest satellite images reviewed by BBC Verify show that blocks have not been placed along roughly 10km (six miles) of territory - leaving some people in Gaza struggling to know where the beginning of what the IDF calls a "dangerous combat zone" is. Last month, one 23-year-old man near Khan Younis - whom the BBC is not naming for his own safety - said Israeli troops suddenly moved blocks near him beyond the mapped line, leaving him "trapped". "We are now living inside the Yellow Line, [but] behind the yellow blocks, with no idea what our fate will be," he said. "The atmosphere at night is terrifying. We hear shells exploding, soldiers advancing, gunfire, and drones buzzing overhead without pause. We are also being shot at directly." Prof Andreas Krieg, a Middle East security expert from King's College London, has called the movement of the blocks a "tool for territorial engineering". "By keeping the legal line on the map and the physical blocks hundreds of metres apart, Israel preserves the ability to shift where Gazans may live, move and farm without ever formally announcing a change of border," he said. But Efraim Inbar - president of the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security - suggested that the mapped line may not account for natural barriers to the markers and that IDF engineers may be putting the blocks where they "find it easier to place". Series of deadly incidents around the Yellow Line Since Katz's warning in October, troops have shot at people crossing the Yellow Line on at least 69 occasions, an analysis of IDF Telegram posts and statements to the BBC showed. On 19 December, the IDF conducted a strike on a school sheltering displaced people in the al-Tuffah neighbourhood of Gaza City - some 330m inside the Palestinian side of the line, according to the IDF maps - but just metres from a yellow block that was moved there. Eyewitnesses said it happened while a wedding was taking place right by the school building. Five people, including children, were killed in the blast, Gaza's Hamas-run Civil Defence agency said. An IDF statement relating to that day said they fired at "suspicious individuals" west of the Yellow Line, adding that the incident remained under review and that it "regrets any harm to uninvolved individuals". In another deadly incident, 17-year-old Zaher Nasser Shamiya was killed near yellow blocks in Jabalia camp in northern Gaza. His father said IDF troops fired at him before running him over with a tank on 10 December. "The tank turned his body into pieces… it came into the safe area [west of the Yellow Line] and ran over him," he said. BBC Verify has approached the IDF for comment on the incident. And in November, local media reported that two children - aged eight and 10 or 11 - were killed by Israeli forces. Their uncle said that the pair had been gathering firewood for their disabled father when they were killed. Addressing the deaths, an IDF statement said it had eliminated two suspects who crossed the Yellow Line, conducted suspicious activities on the ground, and approached IDF troops. It did not offer details on how the pair were identified as suspects. An IDF spokesperson accused Hamas fighters of firing on troops six times "beyond the Yellow Line" over the past week, in a statement to BBC Verify. Demolitions and fortification While Israel agreed to withdraw its forces behind the Yellow Line under October's ceasefire deal, videos and satellite images seen by BBC Verify have repeatedly shown IDF vehicles operating beyond the mapped Yellow Line. In verified clips, armoured personnel carriers and bulldozers were seen 400m past the mapped Yellow Line at the Bani Suhaila roundabout in Khan Younis, while a satellite image taken on 25 December appeared to show a tank, excavator and other IDF vehicles positioned about 260m beyond the Yellow Line in Beit Lahia. In some cases, the movements of blocks were followed by demolitions of nearby buildings by the IDF. In the eastern part of Gaza City, satellite images show that hundreds of buildings were levelled up to and even beyond the first position of the blocks, then the markers were moved and there was further destruction In the nearby area of Jabalia, Israeli troops demolished a series of school buildings that were around 150m inside the mapped line. In some instances where IDF demolitions have occurred, the debris has effectively hidden the markers from Palestinians on the ground. An IDF spokesperson said that troops were dismantling Hamas' tunnel network that it said runs under buildings on both sides of the Yellow Line, adding that the tunnels' destruction "may cause the collapse of buildings on both sides of the line". On Wednesday, the US said the second phase of the ceasefire deal is due to begin, under which Israel is expected to withdraw from additional parts of the Strip. But there was no mention of a timeline for the withdrawal, which is linked to the "demilitarisation" of Hamas under October's ceasefire deal. In parts of the Strip, the markers have been placed shortly before work began on the construction of temporary Israeli fortifications such as roadblocks and defensive barriers beyond the mapped Yellow Line. Krieg told BBC Verify that the movement of the blocks would eventually allow Israel to turn parts of Gaza into a "sterilised belt". "In practice, that means the status of land is less about what the ceasefire map says and more about where concrete blocks sit on a given day," he said. Additional reporting by Maha El Gaml.

**Excerpt**

Trump's Fed fight looks like something from another country A political leader demanding questionable policy from the central bank and testing the legal limits to get it - to Martin Redrado, sitting in Argentina, Donald Trump's stand-off with the Federal Reserve feels surprisingly familiar. Redrado was fired as head of Argentina's central bank in 2010, after he resisted orders by then-President Cristina Kirchner to hand over reserves to help pay off national debts. He fought the decision successfully in court, but eventually resigned in the face of what he told the BBC was "intolerable" pressure. Today, the clash is remembered as one of the early warnings of the economic turmoil that later engulfed Argentina, exposing it to high inflation and a currency plunge from which the country is still recovering. Trump's fight with the Fed has sparked debate about whether the US might be heading in a similar direction. Since his return to office last year, Trump has accused the chair of the US central bank, Jerome Powell, of mishandling the economy and driving up debt costs for the government by keeping interest rates too high. But his interventions at the bank have not been limited to social media complaints. In August, Trump moved to sack a top policymaker, Lisa Cook, a decision now being challenged at the Supreme Court. Then on Sunday, Powell said the Fed was facing a criminal probe from the Department of Justice, relating to cost overruns at a property renovation - concerns that Powell has dismissed as "pretext". Market reaction to the drama has remained muted, which analysts said was a sign that investors expect the bank to be able to continue operating freely. But that faith will be tested in the coming weeks, when the Supreme Court is due to hear arguments about Cook's firing and the president is expected to announce his pick to replace Powell, whose term as Fed chair ends in May. Redrado said he has been surprised to see echoes of his own battle happening in the US, long held up as a global model. "This seems more like an emerging market story," he said. He is not alone in making the comparison. "This is what you do in banana republics, not what should happen in the United States of America," economist Jason Furman, who led former President Barack Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, told the BBC, using a derogatory term often used to describe countries with unstable politics and economies subject to the whims of a ruling class. In an interview with CNBC, former Fed chair Janet Yellen, who served as Treasury Secretary under Joe Biden, raised a similar spectre as she warned against the way Trump wants the Fed to conduct policy. "It is the road to a banana republic," she said. Inflationary risks Trump has remained defiant in the face of calls to limit his interference with the bank, a powerful economic player, which has access to vast financial reserves and the ability to influence borrowing costs across an economy. He has denied involvement in the criminal probe, which he said had nothing to do with interest rates, while maintaining he has a right to express his views. "I think it's fine what I'm doing," he said. But economists say Trump keeps up his attacks at the risk of the economy, arguing that hard-won evidence shows central banks deliver the best results when they operate without political pressure. That consensus emerged from painful run-ins with inflation in the 1970s, including in the US, leading to a wave of global reforms. Extensive academic research has since linked central bank independence to lower inflation over time. Experts say elected officials have too many incentives to try to use bank power to secure an immediate economic boost or satisfy particular constituencies, even if it might hurt the economy over the long run. But though Trump's pressure on the Fed is unprecedented for the US, the president is hardly the only head of state to disregard advice to leave central bankers alone. In the UK, former Prime Minister Liz Truss has attacked the Bank of England, criticising its independence and accusing it of having too much power. A study of central banks in 118 countries between 2010 and 2018 found roughly 10% of central banks each year faced pressure from political leaders, like Trump, wanting lower interest rates, which make borrowing less expensive and can deliver a short-term economic boost. Pressure on central bankers was most likely to emerge in countries with nationalist or populist leaders and was typically followed by higher inflation, says economist Carola Binder, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin who conducted the review. In Turkey, for example, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan cycled through three central bank leaders in three years between 2019 and 2021, as he looked for someone who would execute on his unorthodox view that high interest rates fed inflation. Inflation soared past 50%, as the bank bowed to his demands, before he agreed to appoint leaders with more moderate views. Even in countries where central banks resisted the interference, Binder's research found that inflation tended to rise, albeit to a lesser degree, suggesting pressure alone could cause damage. Binder says she thinks the pressure led people to doubt central banks' ability to manage inflation effectively, causing them to expect higher prices in the future - a view that is often self-fulfilling. For now, polls suggest inflation expectations in the US remain contained, making the likely significance of the current fight more political than economic, Binder says. Still, she warned: "That is a possibility for the US - that this could be inflationary." US fallout Even if the Fed became a tool of the president, analysts believe the US economy was unlikely to face as severe a fallout as smaller nations like Argentina and Turkey. But some say there are already signs the fight is having consequences, pointing to an 8% fall in the value of the dollar against a basket of currencies over the last year. Over the long term, it can be hard to identify the driver of economic damage - whether it is the loss of central bank independence or other, often related issues, like the erosion of democracy or rule of law, says Carolina Garriga, professor of political science at the University of Essex. But she says immediate market moves, like a dip in the dollar that followed the announcement of the Fed criminal probe, show investors consider central bank independence an important piece of the puzzle. "It's hard to disentangle but it is not hard to disentangle when it's market reaction to an announcement." Since the criminal probe became public, key Wall Street leaders and members of Congress, including some Republicans, have spoken up forcefully in defence of the Fed. At the Supreme Court, justices have also indicated that they see the bank as different from other arms of government, where they have let Trump's firings proceed. Analysts say they think the Fed will be able to maintain confidence in its policies, noting that it sets interest rates via a committee with 12 members, of whom the president appoints only seven and who each have long, staggered terms. "There is slight concern," says Jennifer McKeown, chief global economist at Capital Economics. "But there's not a switch here that says faith in US institutions has been lost and therefore we're in a downward spiral." But much of the Fed's reputation for independence is rooted in convention, rather than legal design. In global comparisons of central bank independence, as measured by legal features, the Fed ranks in the bottom third. Redrado said he remained hopeful that the strength of US institutions would prevail, unlike in Argentina, while warning that Trump was running unnecessary risk. "President Trump is really defeating himself by having this kind of fight," he said. "He should know better."

**Excerpt**

South Korea's impeached president found guilty in first of four trials: What you need to know South Korea's beleaguered ex-president Yoon Suk Yeol has been found guilty of abuse of power, falsifying documents and obstructing justice when he tried and failed to impose martial law in the country in 2024. He has also been sentenced to five years in jail. Yoon is facing three other trials for charges ranging from insurrection to violating campaign law. Here's what to know about the key charges laid against Yoon. Obstruction of justice On Friday, Yoon was found guilty of obstruction of justice by evading arrest; abuse of power by not convening a cabinet meeting before his martial law declaration; and falsifying official documents. Prosecutors accused him of using state institutions "for personal purposes" to conceal wrongdoing and undermine constitutional checks and balances. In January last year, it took some 3,000 police officers, over two attempts, to finally take Yoon into custody for questioning over the insurrection charge. Yoon had mobilised a large group of security officers who formed a human wall inside his residence to block the arrest - a move that a special prosecutor investigating the charge said was unprecedented. Yoon, meanwhile, argued the Corruption Investigation Office that attempted to arrest him lacked jurisdiction to investigate insurrection charges. The chaos surrounding the arrest, and the earlier failed attempt, "demonstrated apparent lawlessness by Yoon, [his] conservative party, and South Korea's domestic security institutions", said Mason Richey, an associate professor at Seoul's Hankuk University of Foreign Studies. "The obstruction of justice trial is a way to ensure accountability for these," he said. Insurrection Under South Korea's constitution, sitting presidents are immune from criminal persecution, except for on charges of insurrection and treason. Yoon was charged on 26 January 2025. By then, parliament had voted to impeach him, but he was not yet removed from office. Prosecutors allege that Yoon attempted to subvert the constitution by declaring martial law in the absence of war or any national emergency. In particular, he's been charged over how he mobilised troops and police to seal off the National Assembly compound to prevent lawmakers from blocking his decree, and how he ordered the arrests of the National Assembly speaker and then-leaders of the main political parties. Yoon had earlier claimed he declared martial law to protect the country from "anti-state" forces that sympathised with North Korea - but it soon became clear he was spurred by his own political troubles. Prosecutors have sought the death penalty, describing Yoon as "unrepentant". South Korea has not executed anyone since December 1997. Former president Chun Doo-hwan, who ruled South Korea in the 1980s as a military dictator, was sentenced to death for leading an insurrection, though this was later reduced to life imprisonment. His ally and successor Roh Tae-woo was handed a lengthy jail term for his part in the insurrection. Both were eventually pardoned. Prosecutors have argued, however, that Yoon's 2024 martial law attempt "tarnished the nation's dignity far more severely" than the military coup Chun and Roh staged in 1979. "We all saw how he disrespected the courtroom, smirking and laughing amongst his lawyers during witness testimonies. That did not help his case at all," said law professor Lim Ji-bong. Lim believes the judge will hand down a life sentence, though, so as to "avoid making Yoon a martyr". A death sentence carries political risk as it may further alienate Yoon's supporters and deepen chaos in the country, he said. US-based lawyer and Korea expert Christopher Jumin Lee believes Yoon will ultimately be pardoned no matter what sentence he receives, as Chun and Roh were. "It's a customary thing about Korean politics," Lee said. "Whatever the sentence, it's a symbolic acknowledgement of how severe the crime is." Aiding an enemy state Prosecutors have also alleged that Yoon tried to provoke North Korea into attacking the South so as to justify his martial law declaration. In putting forward this charge, the prosecution relied on evidence found on former military intelligence chief Yeo In-hyung's phone that contained words suggesting potential provocations. They also cited a memo which appeared to push for a move to "create an unstable situation or seize an arising opportunity". This trial, which opened on Monday, will look at whether Yoon ordered drone flights into the North to induce military conflict between the Koreas, among other things. Yeo and Yoon's former defence minister Kim Yong-hyun have also been indicted on the same charge. Other charges Yoon has also been accused of perjury, for when he testified during former prime minister Han Duck-soo's trial last year on charges of aiding the insurrection. Prosecutors allege that Yoon falsely testified by claiming he had long planned to hold a cabinet meeting before declaring martial law. Investigators said Yoon had no such plan and only convened a meeting at Han's urging. Apart from charges related to his martial law attempt, Yoon has also been indicted in a series of other cases. He is among 33 people charged for allegedly obstructing an investigation into the death of a young marine officer in 2023, and for aiding the suspect in this case. He has also been charged for meddling in the 2022 presidential elections and making false statements during his campaign.

Chinese woman's plea for help killing pigs draws thousands to her village When Daidai realised her father was too old to slaughter two pigs for a traditional community feast in the run-up to Chinese New Year, she turned to social media. She didn't want him to feel bad. "Can anyone help me?" she asked on Douyin, China's version of Tiktok, at the end of last week. "My father is old. I am worried that he can't handle these pigs." Daidai, who's in her 20s, promised that those who came to their village, Qingfu, to assist would be treated to a pork banquet. In rural Sichuan and Chongqing, large community meals are an important part of culture, featuring twice-cooked pork, steamed ribs, soup and homemade liquor. "Let me hold my head up high in our village," she said. Her appeal for help attracted more than a million likes and the response on the ground was like a scene from a cheesy feel-good movie, as thousands of cars poured in, carrying many more people than she needed for the task. So many responded that traffic jams have brought roads in this part of rural Chongqing in south-west China to a standstill. Drone images show carloads of people queuing up with rice crops on either side hoping to still enter Qingfu. Walking in from long distances has been a traffic-beating option for some. Daidai posted that drivers coming into the area should be careful on the roads, especially those from the city unaccustomed to conditions in the countryside. "The atmosphere has been great. It reminded me of my childhood when my family still kept pigs. It has been years since I felt anything like that," one man, who drove more than 100 kilometres (65 miles) to get there, told the BBC. He has seen licence plates from all over the country, he said. When the pig slaughter and subsequent mass banquet did happen, it was watched live online by more than 100,000 viewers, registering 20 million likes, and the local government embraced it as a flash-tourism moment. With many more people in town than two pigs could feed, tourism officials donated more pigs to meet the huge demand, and small restaurants have been serving crowds of visitors in outdoor seating areas. Yet what this phenomenon has shown is how quickly a small matter can become something massive in the age of social media. "I thought maybe a dozen people would come," Daidai told Chinese media. "But there have been too many to count." The response has also been driven by what seems to be a yearning from Chinese people to get back in touch with community cultural events, as well as a need for positive experiences when life can, at times, seem very dark. Daidai couldn't believe how quickly it's all happened. Last Friday she posted her request for help. By Saturday the response was so large that she went to the police to warn them that there could be disruption in the village and extra officers were brought in to manage the situation. The banquet celebration, by then huge in size, went on for two days – 1,000 diners on 11 January became 2,000 the next day – with bonfires into the night and much partying, accompanied by a band. Eventually, Daidai posted that her celebration was over, urging any more visitors to enjoy the region but not visit her home. After sleeping for only four hours over two days, she said she was exhausted. However, it had been an incredible moment for her and her village. To all the strangers who answered her call she said, "without your enthusiasm and passion, there would not have been a feast like this". "For everyone who came, the feeling was like that of a big family. It was really warm, really healing and really meaningful." She thanked government officials and the police for allowing a sudden celebration of this size to proceed. It is already being predicted that the now famous Hechuan region, where her village is located, may try to turn this into a regular event, to tap into the enthusiasm for genuine, grass-roots interaction in a world where many feel isolated and removed from their culture. One villager was quoted in the People's Daily as saying: "Here neighbours help each other. Today I might help you slaughter a pig at your place, tomorrow you will come to my place to do the same." As for Daidai's father, she said in an interview: "My dad is very happy. Seeing this many people arrive he had to borrow tables and chairs from other villagers. We've never experienced anything like this."

**Excerpt**

How realistic is India's quest for magnets made of rare earths In November 2025, India approved a 73bn-rupee ($800m; £600m) plan that could help it to cut its dependence on China in one of the most strategic corners of the global supply chain: rare earth magnets. These small but powerful components sit at the heart of modern life - used in everything from electric vehicles and wind turbines to smartphones, medical scanners, and defence equipment. Developing a full rare earths ecosystem is expensive, complex and time-consuming. By focusing on magnets instead, one of the most widely used rare-earth products, India aims to achieve self-reliance more quickly. But its success will depend on how fast the country can master technology, secure materials and scale up, experts say. Under the scheme, selected manufacturers will receive capital and sales-linked incentives to produce 6,000 tonnes of permanent magnets a year within seven years. The aim is to meet rising domestic demand, which officials expect to double in five years. Industry experts warn that money alone will not be enough. India today imports 80- 90% of its magnets and related materials from China, which controls more than 90% of global rare earth processing. Official figures show the country imported some $221m worth of magnets and related raw material in 2025. That dependence was exposed last year when China tightened exports during a trade dispute, hitting Indian carmakers and electronics firms, and forcing the electric vehicle (EV) industry to explore alternatives to rare earth magnets altogether. The disruption was temporary, but the lesson lingered - without a sovereign rare earths strategy, entire industries remain vulnerable. India is not alone in scrambling for alternatives. The EU, Australia and others have launched similar efforts to loosen China's grip. For many countries, "the timing of the controls came as a surprise", says Rajnish Gupta, a tax and economic policy specialist at EY India. India's challenge, however, is more complex. For one, it lacks industrial expertise. Countries such as Japan, South Korea and Germany have spent years refining magnet-making technology. India in comparison has virtually no commercial-scale experience, experts say. "This is a good step in the right direction, but it's only a start," says Neha Mukherjee of Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, a consulting firm that deals with batteries and rare earth elements. "India will need strategic partnerships to import technology, skill up its workforce and then build its own capabilities." Dr PV Sunder Raju, chief scientist at the National Geophysical Research Institute (NGRI), echoed the concern. "It's not possible to just give 73bn rupees and expect a product without a strong background in research and development," he said. There are several research centres, he points out, which can be put to the task. A facility was inaugurated in 2023 at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, and another plant backed by public and private partners aims to produce 5,000 tonnes of magnets a year by 2030. But neither has yet reported output. There is also the question of raw materials. India holds the world's third-largest, rare earth reserves, about 8% of the global total, largely in the sands of coastal states like Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Gujarat. Yet it accounts for less than 1% of global mining. Only one mine is operational in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, and until recently most of its output was exported to Japan under a bilateral deal. (In June 2025, however, India reportedly asked the state miner, IREL, to suspend these exports to safeguard supplies for domestic needs.) To be fair, India is actively working to expand mining and processing operations. For instance, it has set up the National Critical Mineral Mission (NCMM) under which it pledged to maintain stockpiles and keep its supply chain resilient. But even if it does manage to tap into its own rare earth reserves, it has only some of the elements needed to make magnets. So, it has surpluses of lighter rare earths such as neodymium, but lacks extractable quantities of heavier elements like dysprosium and terbium, which are critical for many high-performance magnets. That raises the question: even if magnets are made in India, will the raw materials still come from China? There are also concerns around the scale of this operation. India already consumes an estimated 7,000 tonnes of magnets a year, Ms Mukherjee says. Producing 6,000 tonnes by the early 2030s may still leave the country short - and exposed - as demand continues to accelerate. "If we do not scale capacity, the problem doesn't get solved. We'll still be dependent on China - and China will scale," Ms Mukherjee explains. Experts also point out that another challenge will be to price domestically made magnets in a way that they don't get undercut by imports. Chinese magnets are cheap and, unless Indian-made alternatives are competitively priced, imports could continue to dominate. The solution, some argue, may lie in incentives not just for manufacturers but for buyers as well. "The hope is that Indian players will continue to put in their entrepreneurial energy and get the ecosystem going," Mr Gupta says. Despite the challenges, the introduction of the scheme is a recognition of India's ambition to bolster its own rare earth ecosystem, and that's worthwhile, he adds. "I think this is certainly better than not having taken the step at all."

Troops and vessels from European Nato allies arrive in Greenland BBC Europe editor Katya Adler is in Greenland where troops and ships from several European states are gathering. The limited deployment involves Germany, France, Sweden, Norway, Finland, the Netherlands and the UK. US President Donald Trump says the US needs to "own" Greenland to prevent Russia and China from doing so.
