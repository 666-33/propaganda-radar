Myanmar begins defence in landmark genocide case at UN court Myanmar has denied committing genocide against the Ronhingya people, saying The Gambia has failed to provide enough proof, as it begun its defence at the UN's top court. Ko Ko Hlaing, a Myanmar government representative, told judges at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) that the allegation was "unsubstantiated". Earlier this week, The Gambia's foreign minister Dawda Jallow told the court Myanmar wanted to erase the minority Muslim population through its use of "genocidal policies". Thousands of Rohingya were killed and more than 700,000 fled to neighbouring Bangladesh during an army crackdown in Myanmar in 2017. A damning report issued by the UN the following year said top military figures in Myanmar must be investigated for genocide in Rakhine state and crimes against humanity in other areas. Myanmar - which has been under military control since it overthrew the civilian government in 2021 - rejected the report and has consistently said its operations targeted militant or insurgent threats. On Friday, Hlaning told the ICJ that "Myanmar was not obliged to remain idle and allow terrorists to have free reign of northern Rakhine states", where the majority of Rohingya lived. "These attacks were the reasons for the clearance operations, which is a military term referring to counter-insurgency or counter-terrorism operations," Hlaing said. The Gambia launched its case against Myanmar in 2019, with Jallow telling the ICJ it did so out of a "sense of responsibility" following its own experience with a military government. Jallow told the court on Monday that the Rohingya "had suffered decades of appalling persecution and years of dehumanising propaganda", which was followed by the military crackdown and "continual genocidal policies meant to erase their existence in Myanmar". Lawyers for the Muslim-majority West African country also argued that the killing of women, children and the elderly, along with the destruction of their villages, was hard to justify under combatting terrorism. "When the court considers... all of the evidence taken together, the only reasonable conclusion to reach is that a genocidal intent permeated and informed Myanmar's myriad of state-led actions against the Rohingya," said Philippe Sands, arguing for The Gambia, which has the backing of 57-nation Organisation of Islamic Cooperation in its action. More than a million Rohingya refugees now live across the border in Bangladesh's Cox's Bazar region alone - some of the largest and most densely populated camps in the world, according to the UN's refugee agency. Hlaing - the Myanmar government representative - said on Friday that it was committed to "achieving the repatriation to Myanmar of persons from Rakhine State currently living in camps in Bangladesh". But he also said external forces, such as Covid-19, had hampered those efforts. "Myanmar's commitment and constant efforts since 2017 contradict Gambia's narrative that Myanmar's intention is to destroy or forcibly deport this population," Hlaing told the court. He added that "a finding of genocide would place an indelible stain on my country and its people", so the outcome was of "fundamental importance for my country's reputation and future". The court has also set aside three days to hear from witnesses, including Rohingya survivors, but these sessions will be closed to the public and media. A final ruling is expected towards the end of 2026, Reuters news agency reported. It is expected to set a precedent in other genocide cases, including one brought by South Africa against Israel over the war in Gaza, as it is the first to be heard in more than a decade - and is being seen as an opportunity for ICJ judges to refine rules around the definition of genocide. The 1948 UN Genocide Convention, which The Gambia accuses Myanmar of breaching in its treatment of the Rohingya, was adopted following the mass murder of Jews by Nazi Germany during the Second World War. It defines genocide as crimes committed "with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group".

**Excerpt**

Exiled crown prince urges world to help protesters topple Iran's government The exiled son of the last Iranian shah (king) has called on the world to help protesters topple Iran's government, saying he is confident "the Islamic Republic will fall - not if, but when". Reza Pahlavi, a US-based opposition leader, asked the world to target Iran's Revolutionary Guard leadership, which he said would "facilitate our task and prevent more loss of life". More than 2,600 protesters have been killed, according to a human rights group, in demonstrations that started over the economy on 28 December and turned into calls for the end of the rule of Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Hosseini Khamenei. The Iranian government has called the protests "riots" backed by Iran's enemies. Pahlavi has emerged as a prominent figure in Iran's fragmented opposition and has previously urged Iranians to escalate their protests. But protesters have been met with deadly force by authorities, masked by a near total shutdown of the internet and communication services. Speaking on Friday at a news conference in Washington, Pahlavi claimed that sections of Iran's security apparatus had refused to take part in the crackdown and that the Iranian authorities had brought in fighters from foreign militias to quell the protests. He urged the world to target Iran's Revolutionary Guards, and command and control infrastructure, calling for a "surgical strike". He also asked global powers to deliver economic pressure, expel Iranian diplomats, demand the release of all political prisoners, and deploy satellite internet Starlink and other secure communications to allow connectivity in Iran. "The Iranian people are taking decisive action on the ground. It is now time for the international community to join them fully," he said. "With or without the world's help, the regime will fall. It will fall sooner and more lives will be saved if the world turns its words into action." He declined to speak about reports that he had held discussions with senior US officials, but said: "I believe that President Trump is a man of his word and, ultimately, he will stand with the Iranian people." Trump has previously warned Iran's government against killing protesters and told CBS News, the BBC's US media partner, that the US would take "very strong action" against Iran if it executed protesters. He later said he had been told "the killing has stopped" - but did not rule out military action against the country. Iran's parliament speaker had warned that if the US attacked, both Israel and US military and shipping centres in the region would become legitimate targets. The US and UK have reduced the number of personnel at the Al-Udeid air base in Qatar, with officials telling CBS News it was a "precautionary measure". On Friday, Pahlavi also vowed to return to Iran and laid out a plan for creating a new constitution in the country. Asked about future leadership in Iran, he said: "It's for the Iranian people to decide." He said he believes he can lead and has the Iranian people's support: "I am trying to help them liberate themselves," he said. Pahlavi said he supported a governing programme based on the principles of Iran's territorial integrity, a separation of religion and state, individual liberties and the right of the Iranian people to decide on the form of democratic government they want. Pahlavi's father, the last shah of Iran, was overthrown in an Islamic revolution in 1979 and a devout Shia Muslim regime took over. The current wave of protests began after shopkeepers in Iran's capital Tehran went on strike over the rising cost of living and the depreciating value of the currency. They quickly spread across the country and turned against Iran's clerical establishment, particularly Khamenei. The slogans chanted by demonstrators have included "Death to the dictator" and "Seyyed Ali [Khamenei] will be toppled this year". According to the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), at least 2,677 deaths have been confirmed and more than 1,600 more are under review. It reports that about 19,000 protesters have been arrested. The Iranian government has imposed an internet blackout on the country since 8 January, with authorities stepping up their crackdown on protests. The BBC and most other international news organisations are also unable to report from inside Iran, making obtaining and verifying information difficult. Residents in four cities - Tehran, Karaj, Isfahan and Sanandaj - told the BBC on Friday there were no protests taking place. Security forces were still present on the streets and in public squares, some said.

Machado vows to lead Venezuela 'when right time comes' Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado has vowed she will lead the country "when the right time comes". "There's a mission, and we are going to turn Venezuela into that land of grace, and I believe I will be elected when the right time comes as president of Venezuela, the first woman president," she told Fox News. Her comments come a day after she gave President Donald Trump her Nobel Peace Prize medal, calling it a recognition of his commitment to Venezuela's freedom. The US seized Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro in Caracas on 3 January and removed him to New York to face various drugs and weapons charges. However, Trump has declined to endorse Machado as Venezuela's new leader, saying she did not have enough domestic support - despite her opposition movement claiming victory in 2024's widely contested elections. He has instead been dealing with the country's interim president Delcy Rodríguez, who had been Maduro's vice-president and who on Friday held a two-hour meeting with the director of the CIA "at President Trump's direction" aimed at building trust and communication between the two countries, according to a US official. "Director Ratcliffe discussed potential opportunities for economic collaboration and that Venezuela can no longer be a safe haven for America's adversaries," the US official said. Asked on Friday about his decision to work with Rodríguez over Machado, Trump told reporters his decision had been informed by the US experience in Iraq more than 20 years ago. Security and political structures were dismantled after the US invaded, setting the scene for insurgency and the eventual emergence of the Islamic State group. "If you ever remember a place called Iraq, where everybody was fired - every single person, the police, the generals, everybody was fired - and they ended up being ISIS... I remember that," he said. Speaking later at an event in Washington, Machado said she was confident there would be an "orderly transition" in her country. "The result of a stable transition will be a proud Venezuela that will be the best ally the US has ever had in the Americas," she said. "This has nothing to do with a tension between Delcy Rodríguez and myself, this is about a criminal structure - that is the regime - and the Venezuelan people," she added, describing herself as "just one member of a movement of millions of Venezuelans". Meanwhile, in Venezuela's capital Caracas, Rodríguez gave her first state of the union address since taking over as interim president. She said she was not afraid to face the US "diplomatically, through political dialogue". Rodríguez also said Venezuela needed to defend its "dignity and honour", and announced oil industry reforms to allow more foreign investment in a step away from Maduro's policies. Trump called Rodríguez a "terrific person" on Wednesday after the pair spoke on the phone, a conversation the Venezuelan leader called "productive and courteous". The following day, the US president called Machado a "wonderful woman who has been through so much", describing her gift of the Nobel Peace Prize medal as a "wonderful gesture of mutual respect".

**Excerpt**

US accuses South Africa military of 'cosying up to Iran' The US has accused South Africa's defence ministry of refusing to obey orders from its own government to send home Iranian warships that have been conducting naval exercises in the African country's waters. "South Africa can't lecture the world on 'justice' while cozying up to Iran," it said in a statement. In response, South Africa's defence ministry said it was launching an inquiry to get to the root of these "serious allegations". Washington has criticised South Africa for inviting Iran at a time when a brutal crackdown against protests was happening in the Middle Eastern country. It said the South African military's actions did not amount to "non-alignment" but were instead a "choice to stand with Iran". "This is absolutely no surprise. Protests against the Iranian regime are happening right now, human rights organisations here in SA have been calling for support for the protesters," William Gumede, an associate professor at the University of Witwatersrand, told the BBC. "These are all democratic violations and human rights abuses and we have not heard a whimper from the ANC. That is the irony and hypocrisy, it's been criticising other regimes but it's been silent on what's happening in Iran." In the strongly worded statement posted on its social media accounts, the US embassy in South Africa said it noted with "concern and alarm" reports that the country's defence minister and its defence forces had defied government orders to ask Iran to leave. The US embassy said Iran's participation "undermined maritime security and regional stability" and was "unconscionable" as it suppressed protests back home, comparing them to "peaceful political activity South Africans fought so hard to gain for themselves". On Friday the office of Defence Minister Angie Motshekga said she "would like to place it on record" that President Cyril Ramaphosa's instructions had been "clearly communicated to all parties concerned, agreed upon and to be implemented and adhered to as such". Dubbed "Peace Resolve", the week-long naval drill got under way last Friday. It is being led by China - and involves other members from an alliance of major developing countries, including Russia, which when it was launched in 2006 was known as Bric. It took its acronym from its founding members Brazil, Russia, India and China - and when South Africa joined four years later an "s" was added to its name. With the recent addition of Egypt, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) the alliance is now called Brics+ - and its aim is to challenge the political and economic power of the wealthier Western nations. Iranian warships had already arrived in Cape Town when the order to turn them around reportedly came through.

**Excerpt**

S Korea's ex-president Yoon to be jailed for five years over martial law bid South Korea's impeached president Yoon Suk Yeol will be jailed for five years over abuse of power, obstructing justice and falsifying documents in relation to his failed martial law bid in 2024. This is the first of the verdicts in four trials linked to his shock martial law decree. Although short-lived, the move triggered nationwide turmoil, sparking protests as MPs rushed to the national assembly to overturn Yoon's decision. Yoon's actions "plunged the country into political crisis", a judge said on Friday, noting that Yoon had "consistently shown no remorse". Friday's ruling offers clues as to how the rest of Yoon's trials could go. His string of charges range from abuse of power to campaign law violations. The most serious charge is insurrection, for which prosecutors have demanded the death penalty. The verdict in that trial is expected in February. About 100 supporters of Yoon had gathered outside the courthouse on Friday to watch the livestreamed proceedings projected on a large screen. Some of them held red banners that read: "Yoon, again! Make Korea great again". Several could be heard yelling at the judge as he delivered the guilty verdicts, while others looked solemn. On Friday, Yoon was convicted of using presidential bodyguards to prevent his arrest; failing to consult his entire cabinet before declaring martial law; as well as drafting and then destroying a falsified document claiming the martial law bid had been endorsed by the prime minister and defence minister. "The accused has the duty to safeguard the constitution and law but turned his back on them," the judge said. Prosecutors had sought a 10-year jail term for the charges in Friday's ruling. Both sides have seven days to appeal. Yoon denied the charges, arguing that the arrest warrant itself was invalid and that the letter of the law does not require him to consult every member of the cabinet before exercising emergency power. He had claimed across his trials that investigators had no legal basis to probe and arrest him in the first place. Most of the accusations against him are invalid because there was no procedural lapse when he declared martial law, he argues. South Korea's courts often grant leniency when the accused accepts guilt or responsibility. But prosecutors argue that Yoon's lack of remorse is grounds for an even more severe penalty. Park Geun-hye, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for abuse of power and bribery in 2021, was the last former president to be jailed for a criminal charge. But she was pardoned and released from prison shortly after. Six months after Yoon's martial law attempt, voters elected opposition leader Lee Jae Myung in a decisive victory . But Yoon's trials bring the spotlight back to deep divisions in South Korea, where the former president retains strong supporters who see him as a martyr. According to a survey conducted last December, nearly 30% of South Koreans did not believe that Yoon's martial law declaration amounted to an insurrection. While his martial law attempt brought tens of thousands of protesters onto the streets, it also saw his supporters show up in counter protests, though in smaller numbers.

**Excerpt**

Landscape beneath Antarctica's icy surface revealed in unprecedented detail A new map has unmasked the landscape beneath Antarctica's ice in unprecedented detail, something scientists say could greatly enhance our understanding of the frozen white continent. Researchers used satellite data and the physics of how Antarctica's glaciers move to work out what the continent might look like beneath the ice. They found evidence of thousands of previously undiscovered hills and ridges, and say their maps of some of Antarctica's hidden mountain ranges are clearer than ever before. While the maps are subject to uncertainties, the researchers believe the new details could shed light on how Antarctica will respond to climate change - and what that means for sea-level rise. "It's like before you had a grainy pixel film camera, and now you've got a properly zoomed-in digital image of what's really going on," lead author Dr Helen Ockenden, a researcher at the University of Grenoble-Alpes, told BBC News. Thanks to satellites, scientists have a good understanding of Antarctica's icy surface – but what lies beneath has remained more of a mystery. In fact, more is known about the surface of some planets in our Solar System than much of Antarctica's "underbelly" – the topography beneath the ice sheet. But researchers now have what they believe to be the most complete, detailed map of that underbelly ever made. "I'm just so excited to look at that and just see the whole bed of Antarctica at once," said Prof Robert Bingham, a glaciologist at the University of Edinburgh who co-authored the study. "I think that's amazing." Traditional measurements from the ground or air have used radar to "see" beneath the ice - which is up to three miles (4.8km) thick in places - often along individual survey lines or tracks. But these tracks could be tens of kilometres apart - leaving scientists to fill in the gaps. “If you imagined the Scottish Highlands or the European Alps were covered by ice and the only way to understand their shape was the occasional flight several kilometres apart, there's no way that you would see all these sharp mountains and valleys that we know to be there,” said Bingham. So the researchers used a new approach, combining their knowledge of the ice surface from satellites and their understanding of how the ice moves from physics - and checking them against those previous tracks. “It’s a little bit like if you're kayaking in a river, and there's rocks underneath the water, sometimes there's eddies in the surface, which can tell you about the rocks under the water,” explained Ockenden. “And ice obviously flows very differently to water, but still, when the ice is flowing over a ridge or a hill in the bedrock […] that manifests in the topography of the surface, but also in the velocity as well.” While we knew about Antarctica's major mountain ranges, the scientists' new approach has revealed tens of thousands of previously undiscovered hills and ridges, as well as greater details around some of those mountains and canyons buried under the ice. "I think it's just really super interesting to look at all these new landscapes and see what's there," said Ockenden. "It's like when you see a map of topography on Mars for the first time, and you're like, 'whoa, this is so interesting, this looks a bit like Scotland,' or 'this looks like nothing I've ever seen before'." One intriguing discovery is a deep channel incised in Antarctica's bed in an area called the Maud Subglacial Basin. The channel is on average 50m deep, 6km wide and runs for nearly 400km (about 250 miles) - roughly the distance from London to Newcastle as the crow flies. The researchers’ new map is unlikely to be the final one. It relies on assumptions about exactly how ice flows which, like any method, comes with uncertainties. And much remains to be discovered about the rocks and sediments that lie beneath the ice. But other researchers agree that, combined with further surveys from the ground, air and space, the maps are a valuable step forward. "This is a really useful product," said Dr Peter Fretwell, senior scientist at the British Antarctic Survey in Cambridge, who was not involved in the new study but has been extensively involved in previous mapping. "It gives us an opportunity to fill in the gaps between those surveys," he added. A more detailed understanding of all of the ridges, hills, mountains and channels could improve computer models of how Antarctica might change in future, the researchers say. That is because these landforms and features ultimately shape how fast the glaciers above move, and how quickly they can retreat in a warming climate. And that is important because the future speed of melting in Antarctica is widely considered to be one of the biggest unknowns in climate science. “[This study gives] us a better picture of what's going to happen in the future and how quickly ice in Antarctica will contribute to global sea-level rise,” agreed Fretwell. The study is published in the academic journal, Science.
