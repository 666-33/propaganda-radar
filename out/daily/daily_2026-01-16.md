China and Canada announce tariffs relief after a high-stakes meeting between Carney and Xi Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Canadian PM Mark Carney have announced lower tariffs, signalling a reset in their countries' relationship after a key meeting in Beijing. China is expected to lower levies on Canadian canola oil from 85% to 15% by 1 March, while Ottawa has agreed to tax Chinese electric vehicles at the most-favoured-nation rate, 6.1%, Carney told reporters. The deal is a breakthrough after years of strained ties and tit-for-tat levies. Xi hailed the "turnaround" in their relationship but it is also a win for Carney, the first Canadian leader to visit China in nearly a decade. He has been trying to diversify Canadian trade away from the US, his country's biggest trading partner, following the uncertainty caused by Trump's on-again-off-again tariffs. The deal could also see more Chinese investments in Canada, right on America's doorstep. Carney himself seemed to allude to the fact that this was a result of Trump's tariffs, which have now pushed one of the US's key allies towards its biggest rival. He told reporters that Canada's relationship with China had been more "predictable" in recent months and that he found talks with Beijing "realistic and respectful". He also made clear Ottawa does not agree with Beijing on everything, adding that in his discussions with Xi he made clear Canada's "red lines", including human rights, concerns over election interference and the need for "guardrails". "We take the world as it is - not as we wish it to be," he said when asked about China's human rights record. Observers believe Carney's visit could set an example for other countries across the world who are also feeling the pain from Washington's tariffs. In contrast, Xi has been trying to show that China is a stable global partner and has been urging more pragmatic ties - in the words of Beijing, "a win-win" for all. And it seems to be working. The South Korean president and the Irish prime minister have both visited Beijing in recent weeks. The UK prime minister is expected to visit soon and so is the German Chancellor. Carney said the "world has changed dramatically" and how Canada positions itself "will shape our future for decades to come," he added. Earlier in his three-day visit, he had said that the Canada-China partnership sets the two countries up for a "new world order". He later added that the multilateral system had been "eroded, to use a polite term, or undercut". As the Chinese and Canadian delegations sat down in the Great Hall of the People on Friday, Xi said: "The healthy and stable development of China-Canada relations is conducive to world peace, stability, development, and prosperity." A trade reset Tariffs have been a key sticking point between the two sides. In 2024, Canada imposed 100% tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, following similar US curbs. Last year, Beijing retaliated with tariffs on more than $2bn (£1.5bn) of Canadian farm and food products like canola seed and oil. As a result Chinese imports of Canadian goods fell by 10% in 2025. In the deal struck on Friday, Canada will allow only 49,000 Chinese electric vehicles into the Canadian market at the 6.1% tariff rate. The cap is in response to Canadian automakers' fears of an influx of affordable Chinese EVs. As well as relief for canola producers, there will also be reduced tariffs on Canadian lobsters, crabs, and peas. China is Canada's second-largest trading partner but it's still a long way behind the US in volume. Economic ties with China are increasingly important for Carney. On arrival in Beijing on Wednesday, he met senior executives from prominent Chinese businesses, including an electric vehicle battery maker and an energy giant. On Thursday the two countries signed several agreements on energy and trade cooperation. The visit is a "reset of a relationship" that may be "modest in ambition" but "much more realistic about what we can reasonably obtain", said Colin Robertson, a former Canadian diplomat and vice-president at the Canadian Global Affairs Institute. A frosty history The last Canadian PM to visit China was Justin Trudeau, who met Xi in Beijing in 2017. That visit took place before the relationship soured in 2018, following Canada's arrest of Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer at the Chinese tech giant Huawai, at the request of the US. Days later, China detained Canadian citizens Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor on espionage charges - a move critics saw as retaliation for Meng's arrest, which China denied. Meng and both Michaels were released in 2021. Ahead of the Carney-Xi meeting, Michael Kovrig wrote on X that the visit should not just be about warming ties but also "managing leverage". Kovrig described Chinese negotiators as "extremely adroit, calculating, and always looking for leverage". "That's why engagement has to be handled with discipline," he wrote, adding that Carney should also advocate for Canadians imprisoned in China. There are about 100 of them, according to Canadian media. Speaking to reporters, Carney was clear that with countries that do not share the same values, Ottawa will engage on a "narrower, more specific" manner. "We're very clear about where we cooperate, where we differ," he said, adding that Chinese claims over self-governed Taiwan and Hong Kong's jailed pro-democracy figure Jimmy Lai came up in "broad discussions". Canada and China have "different systems", he said, which limits the breadth of their cooperation. "But to have an effective relationship, we have direct conversations. We don't grab a megaphone and have the conversations that way."

'I was hit in the face by pellets': Iranians on border describe violence and more protests At the border crossing from Iran into Iraqi Kurdistan, the stern face of Iran's former supreme leader, Ayatollah Khomeini, peers down at the trickle of Iranians leaving the territory. Thick snowflakes confetti the lorries and pedestrians arriving at this remote mountain pass. Metres away, just beyond the border post, an Iranian flag flutters in the snow. Iran has shut down the internet and blocked phone calls into the country, but its borders are still open. Inside the arrivals hall, we find dozens of men, women and children – many arriving to visit family on the Iraqi side of the border. No-one we met said they were fleeing Iran because of the recent protests and government crackdown, but one man – who asked us to hide his identity – told us security forces had shot him during a protest in central Iran last Friday. "I was hit in the face by seven pellet rounds," he said, pointing out several weals and bruises on his face. "They struck above my eyelid, on my forehead, my cheek, my lip, under my ear and along my jaw. I had to use a razor blade to cut one of the pellets out." He told us he was too afraid of being arrested to get medical help, and that others injured during the government crackdown on protestors were also avoiding treatment, out of fear that security forces would arrive and arrest them. "One of my friends told me he was hit by a pellet round," he told us. "His son, who is around 12 or 13 years old, was struck twice in the leg by live ammunition. One of the bullets is lodged in the shin bone. They're terrified of going to hospital to have it removed." Iran's regime has treated these protests as an existential threat. Its crackdown seems to be working, and protesters are now thought to be largely staying at home, for fear of being shot or arrested. Rights groups say at least around 2,500 people have been killed. But several people here told us that demonstrations had continued, at least into this week. The protester we spoke to said security forces had crushed protests in his own town last Friday, but that they had continued elsewhere. "Demonstrations were still going on in Fardis and Malard, and some areas of Tehran," he said. "My friends were there. We were constantly on the phone. On Tuesday night, the protests were still going on, but I haven't had any updates since then." Iranians don't need a visa to cross here, and officials say there is regular traffic back and forth. Another man we spoke to at the border said he had been in Tehran on Wednesday, and seen protesters on the street. It's not clear what form of protest that was, or how many were taking part. The BBC has seen no hard evidence that street protests are still continuing. Very little footage at all is trickling out, and the reports we heard today are impossible to confirm. The BBC, along with other international media, is barred from reporting inside Iran. The government's repression largely seems to be working. But the economic problems that sparked this crisis haven't gone away. A teacher from a town close to the border told us she didn't care who the leader was, she just wanted the economic situation to improve. "We don't want anything more than our basic rights," she told me. "To own a house, to own a car, to have a normal life. My salary lasts 10 days, and I have to borrow money to cover the rest of the month. It's very bad." I ask about US President Donald Trump, and his threat of military strikes if the regime kept killing protesters. "We're waiting to see what Trump does," he told me. "In the meantime, civilians are getting killed." The force with which Iran's leaders have crushed this protest signals their weakness. The regional proxy groups they once used as defences against attack have been weakened by Israel's war with Hamas and Hezbollah, and by the fall of the former Syrian President, Bashar al-Assad. And the Israeli-US war with Iran last year has depleted its military capabilities, and left it vulnerable to attack. Hidden behind this mountainous border, Iran's regime is re-imposing its control. But hidden behind that repressive control is the growing fear of the Islamic Republic, unable to meet its people's most basic demands: protection from foreign attacks, and prosperity at home.

### 3. [US Congress members visit Denmark as Trump's pressure on Greenland rises](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9qpy952xvno?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

US Congress members visit Denmark as Trump's pressure on Greenland rises A bipartisan group of members of the US Congress is visiting Denmark in what is seen as a show of support in the face of increasing pressure from President Donald Trump for the US to annex Greenland - a semi-autonomous region of Denmark in the Arctic. The 11-member delegation is meeting MPs as well as Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and her Greenlandic counterpart Jens-Frederik Nielsen. The visit comes days after high-level talks in Washington failed to dissuade Trump from his plans. He insists Greenland is vital for US security - and that Denmark cannot defend it against possible Russian or Chinese attacks. Both Denmark and Greenland say they are opposed to a US takeover. Greenland is sparsely-populated but resource-rich and its location between North America and the Arctic makes it well placed for early warning systems in the event of missile attacks and for monitoring vessels in the region. The US already has more than 100 military personnel permanently stationed at its Pituffik base - a facility that has been operated by the US since World War Two. Under existing agreements with Denmark, the US has the power to bring as many troops as it wants to Greenland. But Trump has said the US needs to "own" it to defend it properly. He has consistently offered to buy it off - an offer rejected by Denmark and Greenland - whilst mooting the possibility of seizing it by force. Denmark has warned that military action would spell the end of Nato - the trans-Atlantic defence alliance where the US is the most influential partner. Nato works on the principle that allies have to aid each other in case of attack from outside - it has never faced an option where one member would use force against another. European allies have rallied to Denmark's support. They have also said the Arctic region is equally important to them and that its security should be a joint Nato responsibility - with the US involved. To this end, several countries including France, Germany, Sweden, Norway, Finland, the Netherlands and the UK have sent a limited number of troops to Greenland in a so-called reconnaissance mission. French President Emmanuel Macron said "land, air, and sea assets" would soon be sent. The US Congressional delegation includes senators and members of the US House of Representatives who are fervent supporters of Nato. It is led by Senator Chris Coons who said earlier this week that "we need to draw closer to our allies, not drive them away". Though Coons and the majority of the delegation are Democratic opponents of Trump, the group includes Republican Senators Thom Tillis and Lisa Murkowski, too. Democratic and Republican lawmakers have introduced legislation to stop Trump seizing Greenland by force. A Republican congressman has also introduced a rival bill in support of the plan to annex the island. Trump's envoy to Greenland Jeff Landry told Fox News on Friday that the US should talk with Greenland's leaders, not Denmark. "I do believe that there's a deal that should and will be made once this plays out," he said. "The president is serious. I think he's laid the markers down. He's told Denmark what he's looking for, and now it's a matter of having Secretary [of State Marco] Rubio and Vice-President JD Vance make a deal. "The United States has always been a welcoming party. We don't go in there trying to conquer anybody and trying to take over anybody's country. We say, 'Listen. We represent liberty. We represented economic strength. We represent protection.'"

### 4. [CIA director had two-hour meeting with new Venezuelan leader in Caracas](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgjn5yyeljo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

CIA director had two-hour meeting with new Venezuelan leader in Caracas CIA director John Ratcliffe met Venezuela's Interim President Delcy Rodríguez in Caracas on Thursday "at President Trump's direction," a US official has said. The two-hour meeting was aimed at building trust and communication following the US seizure of Venezuela's former president Nicolás Maduro almost two weeks ago. Ratcliffe and Rodríguez discussed potential economic collaboration and that "Venezuela can no longer be a safe haven for America's adversaries", according to the US official. The meeting took place on the same day Rodríguez gave her first state of the union address since taking over as interim president, where she announced oil industry reforms to allow more foreign investment - a move away from Maduro's policies. During her speech to the nation, Rodríguez said she was not afraid to face the US "diplomatically through political dialogue," adding Venezuela had to defend its "dignity and honour". President Donald Trump has said US oil companies will move into Venezuela and make money that will go to people there and to the US, with a top official saying the US would control sales of sanctioned Venezuelan oil "indefinitely". Trump has asked oil companies to invest at least $100bn (£75bn) in Venezuela, but one executive said last week the country is currently "uninvestable". Rodríguez, the former vice-president, was sworn in on 5 January after US forces seized Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores in an operation in Caracas. They are now detained in New York, where they have pleaded not guilty to drug trafficking and other charges. The US official described the meeting between Rodríguez and Ratcliffe as "historic", adding that Ratcliffe was the first cabinet-level official to travel to Venezuela. The meeting also happened on the same day that Trump met opposition leader Maria Corina Machado in Washington, who presented the US president with her Nobel Peace Prize winning medal. In her state of the union address, Rodríguez told Venezuelans it was "very difficult" to deliver Maduro's annual report, saying that the two were working on the speech together until six hours before his seizure on 3 January. Noting the US is a nuclear power, the interim president said she was not afraid to engage in diplomacy, saying "we have to go together as Venezuelans to defend sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and also defend our dignity and our honour". She continued that if she needed to travel to Washington DC to meet with Trump, she would do so "walking on her feet, not dragged there". She added that "all of Venezuela is threatened", and called for national unity to "wage the diplomatic battle". In her address, Rodríguez announced the proposal to reform the country's hydrocarbon law, saying she had asked the legislative body to approve it. Until now, Venezuela's hydrocarbon law has stated foreign partners must work with the country's state-owned oil and gas company, PDVSA - which must hold a majority stake. The reforms, Rodríguez said, would allow investment to flow to new fields. She said she had instructed her government to create two sovereign funds - one for social protection so that "foreign currency goes directly to hospitals, schools, food, housing" and the second for infrastructure and social development to invest in water, electricity and roads. Venezuela has been facing an economic crisis, with a sharp rise in food prices and the lack of purchasing power. Before the US operation to seize Maduro, Venezuelans told the BBC they were concerned about what they were going to eat. "We're more worried about food. Venezuela is in bad shape. Inflation is eating us alive," one man said. Rodríguez's reforms come as Trump and American investors eye opportunity in Venezuela, which holds the world's largest proven oil reserves. Bosses of the biggest US oil firms who attended a meeting at the White House last week acknowledged that Venezuela represented an enticing opportunity. But they said significant changes would be needed to make the region an attractive investment. Trump said his administration would decide which firms would be allowed to operate. "You're dealing with us directly. You're not dealing with Venezuela at all. We don't want you to deal with Venezuela," he said. Trump also said that "one of the things the United States gets out of this will be even lower energy prices". Venezuela has had a complicated relationship with international oil firms since crude oil was discovered in its territory more than 100 years ago. Chevron is the last remaining major American oil company still operating in the country.

Opposition supporters killed in overnight clashes as Uganda president takes election lead At least seven Ugandan opposition supporters were killed overnight in disputed circumstances, as President Yoweri Museveni has taken a strong lead in results from Thursday's presidential election. The opposition say they were attacked by security forces in the home of an MP in Butambala, about 55km (35 miles) south-west of the capital, Kampala, while police blame the violence on the opposition. Figures announced by the electoral commission on Friday afternoon put Museveni in front with 75% of the votes, based on returns from 60% of polling stations. He is followed by opposition leader Bobi Wine on 21%. His home in Kampala has been surrounded by security forces "effectively placing him and his wife under house arrest", Wine's National Unity Platform (NUP) said. The internet shutdown imposed earlier in the week means news of the violence is only emerging on Friday in Uganda. Opposition MP Muwanga Kivumbi told the AFP news agency that soldiers and police fired tear gas and then live bullets at hundreds of people who were following early results at his home. "Ten were killed inside my house," he said. Human rights activist Agather Atuhaire confirmed this account to the Reuters news agency. However, local police spokesperson Lydia Tumushabe disputes this, maintaining police fired in self defence after a "a group of NUP goons" had attacked a police station and planned to overrun a tallying centre. She told Reuters they were carrying machetes, axes and boxes of matches and said at least seven people had been killed. Meanwhile, some local journalists say security forces have blocked them from accessing the opposition leader's home in Kampala's Magere area. "Security officers have unlawfully jumped over the perimeter fence and are now erecting tents within his compound," the NUP posted on X late on Thursday. Police spokesman Kituuma Rusoke told local broadcaster NBS that as a presidential contestant, Wine was "a person of interest", adding that the heavy security deployment around his home was for his own security. Following the 2021 election, in which he garnered 35% of the vote, Wine was confined to his home for several days by security forces. Electoral chief Simon Byabakama said on Friday that the vote counting had not been affected by the internet blackout imposed earlier in the week, as the commission was using a "private system" to transmit results from districts to the national tally centre. Asked about the timing of the final results announcement, Byabakama said: "We are on course to announce the winner of the presidential election within 48 hours. Before 5 PM [14:00 GMT] tomorrow, we shall have the final results." Ugandans voted in a tense national election on Thursday after an often violent campaign, with President Museveni, 81, seeking a seventh term in office. Wine, a 43-year-old pop star-turned-politician, has alleged "massive" fraud during the election, which was held under an internet blackout. He did not provide documentary proof and the authorities have not responded to his allegations. Last week, the United Nation's Human Rights Office said that the election would be marked by "widespread repression and intimidation". During Thursday's vote, voting was delayed by up to four hours in many polling stations around the country as ballot boxes were slow to arrive and biometric machines, used to verify voters' identity, did not work properly. Some have linked the problems to the network outage. Although there are other six candidates, the presidential poll is essentially a two-horse race between Museveni and Wine, but given the president has won the six previous elections, analysts say he is likely to further extend his time in power. Wine, who says he represents the youth in a country where most of the population is aged under 30, has promised to tackle corruption and impose sweeping reforms, while Museveni argues he is the sole guarantor of stability and progress in the country. The campaign period was marred by the disruption of opposition activities - security forces have been accused of assaulting and detaining Wine's supporters. Police spokesperson Kituuma Rusoke dismissed these complaints, accusing opposition supporters of being disruptive. Internet access was suspended on Tuesday, with Uganda's Communications Commission saying the blackout was necessary to prevent misinformation, fraud and the incitement of violence - a move condemned by the UN human rights office as "deeply worrying". Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, had called on his supporters to protest, if Thursday's election results were manipulated. However, as of Friday morning, there have been no signs of any demonstrations. A Museveni victory would extend the former rebel leader's four-decade grip on power. He is widely believed to favour his son, military chief Muhoozi Kainerugaba, as his successor, though he denies grooming him for the role. The final presidential result is expected be announced by 16:00 local time (13:00 GMT) on Saturday, according to the electoral commission.

**Excerpt**

Actor Timothy Busfield charged with sexually abusing boys on set of TV series Actor Timothy Busfield has made his first court appearance after turning himself in on criminal charges that he allegedly sexually abused two boys on the set of a TV series filmed in New Mexico, prosecutors say. The Emmy-winning actor, who starred in Thirtysomething and The West Wing, was taken into custody in Albuquerque on two counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor and one count of child abuse that police allege happened on the set of Fox's crime drama The Cleaning Lady. Busfield, 68, strenuously denied the allegations through his lawyer. "The claims being made against Tim are completely false, and we will fight this to the end until the truth prevails," the lawyer, Stanton "Larry" Stein, said. Stein said the actor, who is also known for his roles in the baseball film Field of Dreams and the comedy thriller Revenge of the Nerds, was being accused as an act of revenge after the children had been terminated from the series, which angered their mother. During a media conference on Thursday, Bernalillo County District Attorney Sam Bregman said that Busfield made an initial court appearance on Wednesday and a judge ordered that he remain in custody. The case is now being transferred to district court and a hearing has been set for 20 January to determine whether Busfield should be released on bail pending trial. "Our priority is to protect the rights of everyone involved," Bregman said at the news conference, urging anyone with information to contact law enforcement. In a warrant for Busfield's arrest, prosecutors say the parents of boys allege that Busfield groomed and sexually abused the youngsters while working on set for The Cleaning Lady, which Busfield both directs and executive produces. It airs on Fox in the US. In an affidavit supporting his arrest warrant, authorities claim the boys referred to Busfield as "Uncle Tim" and alleged that he "would tickle them on the stomach and legs". Both boys told authorities they were touched inappropriately for years, the arrest affidavit states. One of the boys alleged that Busfield touched his private areas, according to court documents. The boy told authorities that the alleged inappropriate touching started when he was 7 years old and he was scared to speak out because he "feared" that Busfield would "get mad at him". The documents state that the boy had suffered nightmares and was having troubles wetting the bed since the alleged encounters. He has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety, authorities say in the court documents. Before he turned himself in, Busfield appeared in a video provided to TMZ saying that he was contacted on Friday night about getting a lawyer. The next day he drove 2,000 miles (3,200 km) to Albuquerque, New Mexico, to surrender to authorities. "They're all lies and I did not do anything to those little boys and I'm gonna fight it. I'm gonna fight it with a great team, and I'm gonna be exonerated, I know I am, because this is all so wrong and all lies," he said in the video. His lawyer says the case stems from wanting revenge. Busfield told authorities that the boys' mother had threatened revenge when they were replaced on the series, the arrest affidavit states. "As reflected in the criminal complaint, after her son was terminated from the show, the boy's mother vowed to 'get her revenge against Timothy Busfield.' What followed appears to be a calculated effort to construct a case, driven by animus not fact, despite prior investigations finding no evidence of wrongdoing," Stein said. Stein added that an investigation opened by Warner Bros about the allegations was closed after they could not find "corroborating evidence that Mr Busfield engaged in inappropriate conduct or that he was ever alone" with the boys. Court documents show that after authorities got a warrant for his arrest, another accusation surfaced alleging Busfield kissed and groped a 16-year-old girl. Prosecutors noted the new allegation in a motion asking that a judge keep Busfield from being released from jail immediately, alleging the actor has a "documented pattern of sexual misconduct, abuse of authority and grooming behavior". In that court document, prosecutors said the girl's father had come forward on Tuesday with allegations that the teen had been sexually abused by Busfield in California "several years ago" at the B-Street Theatre, which the actor co-founded in Sacramento. The father alleged to authorities that the encounter happened when the girl was auditioning at the theatre and the actor allegedly kissed her and touched her sexually, the court document states. Court documents state that the father alleged that the actor "begged the family to not report to law enforcement" and agreed to go to therapy. Busfield's lawyer told the BBC that the actor denies all the allegations and "maintains that they are completely false". When asked about the additional accusation surfacing, Stein said Busfield had volunteered to do a polygraph test and had passed it. The lawyer did not provide further details on the test. Busfield has previously been accused of sexual assault by two women in the 1990s and in 2012, which prosecutors pointed to in court documents. The Cleaning Lady producer Warner Bros Television and Fox said that they were aware of the charges against Busfield and would work with law enforcement. They told the Los Angeles Times that they prioritise the health and safety of their cast and crew. A spokesperson for Busfield's wife Melissa Gilbert, who starred in the series Little House on the Prairie, told the BBC that she would not make public statements and pushed back against fake comments circulating online that claim to have come from her. "She is honoring the request of Tim's lawyers not to speak publicly while the legal process unfolds," her publicist Ame Van Iden said. "During this period, her focus is on supporting and caring for their very large family, as they navigate this moment. Melissa stands with and supports her husband and will address the public at an appropriate time. We ask that their privacy be respected."

**Excerpt**

Man accused of murdering woman and toddler in Munich car attack goes on trial A man has gone on trial in Germany charged with driving his car into a crowd of people in the city of Munich last year, killing two people. The 25-year-old man, named only as Farhad N, in line with German privacy laws, is an Afghan national. Prosecutors say that on the morning of 13 February 2025, he deliberately drove his BMW Mini into a trade union demonstration in the centre of Munich. About 1,400 people were taking part in the street rally. A 37-year-old woman called Amel and her two-year-old daughter Hafsa died in hospital of their injuries shortly afterwards. Among the 44 others who were hurt, a number suffered critical injuries. Those taking part in the union rally included city workers such as hospital and daycare staff calling for better wages. Amel herself had been working as an engineer and had come to Germany from Algeria at the age of four. Farhad N went on trial on Friday only a few hundred metres from the scene of the attack. Federal prosecutors say they believe he "committed the crime out of excessive religious motivation. "He believed he was obliged to attack and kill randomly selected people in Germany in response to the suffering of Muslims in Islamic countries," they say. According to investigators, the man shouted "Allahu Akbar" and prayed after committing the act. He is also accused of watching extremist preachers online. However, officials do not believe he was part of any jihadist movement such as Islamic State. At the start of the trial the defendant hid his face behind a red folder and raised his right index finger – a common gesture among Muslims worldwide, symbolising belief in one God. His lawyer said his client would not comment on either the attack or his personal circumstances. Officials say he arrived in Germany in 2016 as a teenager. Germany took in more than a million asylum seekers in 2015-2016 at the height of Europe's migrant crisis - an influx that has proved deeply divisive and fuelled the rise of the far-right AfD. Farhad N came alone, without his family and, although his asylum request was rejected, he was not deported and had been given temporary residency in Munich. German authorities said he was legally resident in Germany, had a work permit and had jobs working as a shop security guard and for security companies. Farhad N had no previous convictions. He was active on Instagram, where he posted about bodybuilding and religious themes. He was arrested on the day of the Munich attack. The trial is expected to continue until June.

Julio Iglesias denies sexual assault allegations Singer Julio Iglesias has denied allegations of sexual assault made by two female former employees. The women allege that the 82-year-old Spanish superstar "normalised abuse" in a coercive, threatening and violent environment while they were working at his properties in the Bahamas and Dominican Republic. Responding on Instagram, Iglesias said: "I deny having abused, coerced, or disrespected any woman. These accusations are absolutely false and deeply sadden me." The allegations, which were first reported earlier this week, are being investigated by Spain's judiciary. The two women - a domestic worker and a physiotherapist - have alleged they suffered sexual and other forms of abuse while working at Iglesias's properties. The reports said they worked in his Caribbean residences for 10 months in 2021, which is when they allege the sexual assaults took place. On 5 January, the women filed a legal complaint for sexual assault and human trafficking with the national court, which investigates crimes allegedly committed beyond Spain's borders. Advocacy groups Women's Link Worldwide and Amnesty International said the acts alleged in the complaint could be considered "a crime of human trafficking for the purpose of forced labour" and "crimes against sexual freedom". According to testimony collected by the two groups, Iglesias subjected the women to "sexual harassment, regularly checked their mobile phones, restricted their ability to leave the home where they worked, and required them to work up to 16 hours a day without days off". Women's Link described the complainants as young Latin American women "in vulnerable situations who were heavily dependent on their wages due to their economic and social conditions". 'Defend my dignity' In his Instagram statement, Iglesias wrote: "It is with profound sadness that I respond to the accusations made by two people who previously worked for me. He added: "I have never felt such malice, but I still have the strength to let people know the whole truth and defend my dignity against such a serious accusation." The singer also thanked the "so many dear people who have sent me messages of affection and loyalty", adding: "I have found great comfort in them." According to by Spanish news site elDiario.es and US outlet Univision, which investigated the claims over three years, the women's allegations are backed up by documentary evidence including photographs, phone records, text messages and medical reports. Their reports cite other former employees who describe a threatening, highly stressful atmosphere for those working for Iglesias. But an old friend of the singer, Jaime Peñafiel, labelled the accusations "absolute lies", while another ally, journalist Miguel Ángel Pastor, said he had never heard "any suggestion that he might have committed this kind of act". Iglesias is one of the most successful Latin artists of all time, having sold more than 300 million records in a career spanning decades. He is also the father of fellow music superstar Enrique Iglesias.

**Excerpt**

Tragic death of Adichie's young son pushes Nigeria to act on health sector failings A series of harrowing cases of allegations of medical negligence, including the death of novelist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's 21-month-old son, has ignited a fierce debate about patient safety within Nigeria's healthcare system. Following the outcry, the health minister has admitted "systemic challenges" and announced the creation of a national task force on "clinical governance and patient safety" to improve the quality of care and patient safety. The family of the internationally acclaimed author says her young son, Nkanu Nnamdi, died last week at a private hospital in the main city, Lagos, following a short illness. They allege the child was denied oxygen and excessively sedated, leading to cardiac arrest. The hospital extended its "deepest sympathies" but in a statement denied any wrongdoing, stating its treatment met international standards. The Lagos State Government has ordered an investigation into the death, as public outrage spread over the state of healthcare in Africa's most populous country. Just days later, anger surged once more after the death of Aisha Umar, a mother of five who ran a business from home, selling incense and fish in the northern city of Kano. Her family alleges a pair of surgical scissors was left inside her abdomen during an operation in September at the state-run Abubakar Imam Urology Centre, leading to four months of severe pain and her eventual death. "For four months, they only gave her pain relievers," her brother-in-law, Abubakar Mohammed, told the BBC. "Scans finally showed the scissors were inside her," he said. The family says they plan to sue the facility for negligence. The Kano State Hospitals Management Board said it had "suspended three personnel directly involved in the case from clinical activities with immediate effect", and has referred the case for further investigation and disciplinary action. "The Board reassures the public that it will not condone negligence in any form and will continue to take decisive actions to safeguard the lives, dignity, and trust of patients across all state health facilities," a spokesman added in a statement issued on 13 January. These high-profile cases have given voice to widespread grievances that often go unheard. Lagos-based products manager Josephine Obi, 29, recounted how her father died in 2021 at the state-run Lagos University Teaching Hospital after what she says was a surgical error during a routine procedure for a goitre - a lump or swelling at the front of the neck caused by a swollen thyroid. "They cut a major artery... it was a very minor surgery," Obi told the BBC. She said a supervising doctor apologised, admitting a mistake had been made. The family chose not to sue to avoid a potentially costly and protracted legal battle. "You will just waste money and the case will linger... we just let it go," Obi said. The BBC sent an email to the hospital seeking comment, but has not yet received a response. The BBC also phoned the numbers listed on the hospital's website, but they failed to go through. In Kano, prison facility officer Abdullahi Umar is still mourning his wife, Ummu Kulthum Tukur, who died three years ago at the age of 27 after giving birth to twins at the state-run Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital. He believes a timely Caesarean section would have saved her life. "She was in labour for over 24 hours... she lost a lot of blood and died," he said, adding that the hospital still refuses to provide a death certificate. Efforts to get the hospital to respond were unsuccessful as the spokesperson Hauwa Inuwa told the BBC she was on leave, instead sending the number of another member of staff, which did not work. Joe Abah, a former boss of Nigeria's Bureau of Public Service Reforms, claimed on social media platform X how a private hospital in the capital, Abuja, urged him to undergo immediate surgery for an ailment. Unconvinced, he sought further opinions, including consultations abroad, which concluded no surgery was necessary, he said. Complaints about treatment in Nigeria's private hospitals are rare, although that is where Adichie's son was treated. They generally have a better reputation than government-owned hospitals, but only a minority can afford to go to them. "Private hospitals are out of the reach of many Nigerians because they are expensive but without doubt offer better care compared to government-owned hospitals which carry more load and have manpower and equipment issues," Dr Fatima Gaya, who works at a public hospital, told the BBC. Many wealthy Nigerians also go abroad for treatment, including President Bola Tinubu and his predecessor, Muhammadu Buhari, who died in a clinic in London in 2025 after he stepped down from office. Dr Mohammad Usman Suleiman, president of the Nigerian Association of Resident Doctors (Nard), told the BBC that the issues were "systemic" and that blaming individuals without addressing the wider problems, such as a lack of doctors and equipment, was futile. "Clinical governance needs to be stepped up. In Nigeria, what we have is individuals being blamed for a systemic problem," Suleiman told the BBC. "If you take six to seven surgeries... eventually, you are exhausted. No doctor wakes up wanting to harm someone." These concerns are supported by data. Two separate surveys last year - from the African Research Journal of Medical Sciences and NOIPolls - found that around 43% of Nigerians had personally experienced or witnessed a medical error or near-miss. About a third of patients experienced additional injuries from treatment. Medics and analysts say Nigeria has a very low doctor-patient ratio, worsened by a massive "brain drain" as health professionals emigrate after being enticed by better working conditions abroad. Remaining health workers sometimes juggle multiple jobs and often go on strike to demand higher salaries, and improved conditions. The Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) says about 15,000 doctors have left the country in the past five years. "An imbalance of over 8,000 patients to one doctor increases overload and stress, which leads to mistakes," public affairs analyst Ibrahim Saidu told the BBC. Nigeria's health system is buckling under these pressures, Saidu added. Chronic underfunding sees the federal government allocate only about 5% of its budget to health, far below the 15% target set in 2001 by the African Union to improve medical services across the continent. Announcing the creation of the national health task force, Health Minister Muhammed Ali Pate acknowledged in a statement that "Nigeria's healthcare system faces systemic challenges" in delivering consistent quality care and ensuring patient safety. "The quality deficits are observed at all levels (public and private) with reports of frequent misdiagnoses, inadequate provider-patient interaction, and lack of care continuity," he said. The minister added that "the high rates of preventable medical errors, lack of accountability mechanisms, fragmented service delivery, and limited workforce capacity" had led to calls for stronger national oversight. The task force will oversee, monitor and drive efforts to integrate quality and patient safety into all areas of healthcare delivery nationwide. It will operate for an initial period of 12 months, with the option of a renewal. While this will be welcomed by many Nigerians, they will want to see the results in the country's clinics and hospitals before they can be convinced that no other patients will become tragic symbols of a national crisis.

### 10. [Trump threatens to invoke Insurrection Act to quell anti-ICE protests in Minnesota](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy15596p98o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

Trump threatens to invoke Insurrection Act to quell anti-ICE protests in Minnesota US President Donald Trump has threatened to invoke the rarely used Insurrection Act to quell unrest over federal immigration enforcement operations in Minneapolis. He threatened to send in troops following a night of protests and vandalism in the Minnesota city after an agent shot a man in the leg. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said an officer opened fire after he was attacked by three Venezuelan nationals with a shovel and broom handle. Tensions have been running high in Minneapolis since an immigration agent fatally shot Renee Nicole Good, 37, last week, sparking nationwide protests. The Insurrection Act is a 19th Century law that allows active-duty military personnel to be deployed for law enforcement duties inside the US. Trump has previously said he might invoke the 1807 law elsewhere without ever doing so. The president posted on Truth Social that he would use the law if Minnesota officials failed to stop the "professional agitators and insurrectionists". DHS said Wednesday's shooting occurred after a car chase involving a Venezuelan national, Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis, who was previously convicted for driving without a licence. The agency statement said after the pursuit, Sosa-Celis got out of his vehicle and fought with the federal agent. Two more migrants from Venezuela who entered the country illegally, Alfredo Alejandro Ajorna and Gabriel Alejandro Hernandez-Ledezma, came out of a nearby apartment, according to the agency. All three attacked the law enforcement officer with a snow shovel and broom handle, DHS said, before the agent opened fire, hitting Sosa-Celis in the leg. The agent was taken to hospital. Sosa-Celis was also taken to hospital with non-life threatening injuries. All three Venezuelans were arrested. "What we saw last night in Minneapolis was an attempted murder of federal law enforcement," said DHS Secretary Kristi Noem. She said the officer was "ambushed and attacked" by the men and fired a defensive shot. On Wednesday night, clashes broke out between protesters and law enforcement in the Hawthorne area of Minneapolis, near the scene of the shooting. City police chief Brian O'Hara said his officers were hit by fireworks, ice and snowballs. Several vehicles belonging to the federal government were damaged in the disorder, and property was stolen from inside the vehicles, according to the FBI. The FBI said on Thursday that it was offering a reward of up to $100,000 for information leading to the "recovery of stolen government property and/or the arrest of individuals responsible for the destruction and theft of government property". Around 3,000 federal officers have been deployed to Minnesota in recent weeks. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, who has demanded ICE leave the city, said on X on Wednesday: "No matter what led up to this incident, the situation we are seeing in our city is not sustainable." Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, a Democrat, made a direct appeal to the president on Thursday posting on X: "Let's turn the temperature down." Walz, who has previously called ICE a "modern-day Gestapo", told Minnesotans: "We cannot fan the flames of chaos." The Democratic governor, who ran for US vice-president alongside Kamala Harris in the 2024 election, said earlier this month he would end his bid for re-election. The move came in the wake of a fraud scandal involving the state's welfare programmes. Trump has said Operation Metro Surge will continue in Minnesota after a federal judge on Wednesday denied Minnesota prosecutors a temporary restraining order against US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Tensions over immigration enforcement have been running high in the city since the fatal shooting on 7 January of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good by an ICE agent. The Trump administration says the ICE agent acted in self-defence, while local officials argue the woman posed no danger. Videos of the incident show ICE agents approaching a car, which is in the middle of the street. As Good turns her wheel and appears to make an attempt to drive off, her car pulls forward and one of the agents near the front of the vehicle points his gun at the driver and fires three shots. The FBI is investigating the incident. An online fundraiser set up for Good's widow and family has raised more than $1.4m. Another online fundraiser for Jonathan Ross, the ICE agent at the centre of the deadly confrontation, has raised $740,000. Do you have a question about Trump's first year back in office?

### 11. [Venezuelan Nobel Peace Prize winner presents her medal to Trump](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2w94wp4p1o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

Venezuelan Nobel Peace Prize winner presents her medal to Trump Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado has given her Nobel Peace Prize medal to President Donald Trump during a meeting at the White House, saying it was a recognition of his commitment to her country's freedom. "I think today is a historic day for us Venezuelans," she said after meeting Trump in person for the first time, weeks after US forces seized Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in Caracas and charged him in a drug-trafficking case. Trump said on social media that the move was "a wonderful gesture of mutual respect", but the Nobel committee has said the prize itself was not transferable. The US president has declined to endorse Machado as Venezuela's new leader, despite her movement claiming victory in 2024's widely contested elections. Trump has instead been dealing with the acting head of state in Venezuela, Delcy Rodríguez, Maduro's former vice-president. But he said meeting Machado was a "great honor", calling her a "wonderful woman who has been through so much". After leaving the White House, Machado spoke to supporters gathered at the gates outside, telling them in Spanish, according to the Associated Press: "We can count on President Trump." "I presented the president of the United States the medal of the Nobel Peace Prize," Machado later told journalists in English, calling it "a recognition for his unique commitment with our freedom". Trump, who often speaks about his desire to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, had expressed displeasure when it was given to Machado and she decided to accept the honour last year. The BBC has reached out to the White House for comment. Machado said last week that she would share it with Trump, but the committee later clarified that it was not transferable. "Once a Nobel Prize is announced, it cannot be revoked, shared, or transferred to others," it said in a statement last week. "The decision is final and stands for all time." Asked for a reaction to Machado's remarks, the committee directed the BBC to their previous statement. Before the White House meeting on Thursday, the Nobel Peace Center posted on X that "a medal can change owners, but the title of a Nobel Peace Prize laureate cannot". In her remarks, Machado described how the Marquis de Lafayette, who fought in America's Revolutionary War, gave a medal bearing the likeness of George Washington to Simon Bolivar, one of the founding fathers of modern Venezuela. The gift was "a sign of the brotherhood" between her country and the US "in their fight for freedom against tyranny," Machado said. "And 200 years in history, the people of Bolivar are giving back to the heir of Washington a medal - in this case a medal of the Nobel Peace Prize - as a recognition for his unique commitment with our freedom," she said. Machado also visited Congress to meet US senators during her visit to Washington, where her remarks to reporters were drowned out by supporters chanting "María, presidente" and waving Venezuelan flags. Machado had been expected to use her time with Trump to try to persuade him that backing Rodríguez's interim government was a mistake, and that her opposition coalition should be in charge of this transition. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters as the meeting was under way on Thursday that Machado is "a remarkable and brave voice for many of the people of Venezuela" and that Trump "was looking forward to this meeting and expecting a frank and positive discussion" about the current realities of life in Venezuela. Trump has previously described Machado as a "freedom fighter", but rejected the notion of appointing her to lead Venezuela after Maduro's removal, arguing that she lacks sufficient domestic support. Freddy Guevara, co-founder of the opposition Venezuelan party Voluntad Popular and a former political prisoner of Maduro now living in exile, told the BBC he didn't think Machado was "looking for endorsement" in giving Trump the prize or that it was a "tactic so Trump can appoint her". "I think this is not a personal goal. I think that María Corina Machado understands the importance, and she believes that this is the right thing to do for the freedom of Venezuela," Guevara said, speaking on Radio 4's Today programme. He said the focus of the opposition was on securing democratic elections for the country. "What we are aiming is to have a democratic transition in which the people of Venezuela are the ones that will decide through their votes who is the one that is going to govern us." Since Maduro was seized on 3 January, the Trump administration has moved quickly to remake Venezuela's oil sector, which had been under US sanctions. On Wednesday an American official said the US had completed its first sale of Venezuelan oil, valued at $500m (£373m). Oil tankers suspected of transporting sanctioned Venezuelan oil have also been seized by the US, with US forces saying they had boarded a sixth tanker on Thursday. Guevara said he didn't think the US's actions just related to oil, "however, we are not naive, and we understand the importance of development and oil for them [the US]. But we believe that both things can work at the same time." A Venezuelan government envoy is expected to travel to Washington on Thursday to meet US officials and take initial steps toward reopening the country's embassy, the New York Times reported. The emissary is reported to be a close ally and friend of Rodríguez, who has been described as "extremely co-operative" by the White House. Rodríguez delivered the annual Message to the Nation speech in Caracas on Thursday, in which she said she was willing to attend meetings in Washington as well. "If I ever have to go to Washington as acting president, I will do so standing tall, walking, and not crawling," she said, calling on the country to "not be afraid of diplomacy" with the US. Trump and Rodríguez also spoke by phone on Wednesday, with Trump later describing his counterpart on social media as "a terrific person". Rodríguez, meanwhile, described the call as "productive and courteous" and characterised by "mutual respect." Do you have a question about Trump's first year back in office?

What happens in space during a medical emergency? Four astronauts evacuated from the International Space Station (ISS) have landed back on Earth, after their stay in space was cut short by a month due to a "serious" medical issue. The astronauts arrived on the ISS on 1 August expecting to complete a standard six and a half month stay. But last week, a scheduled spacewalk was called off at the last minute. Hours later, Nasa revealed a crew member had become ill. It is the first time astronauts have been evacuated due to a health issue since the station was put into Earth's orbit in 1998. BBC science correspondent Pallab Ghosh explains how Nasa deals with medical emergencies in space.
