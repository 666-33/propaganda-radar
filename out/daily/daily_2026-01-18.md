Fears Iran's internet shutdown could lead to 'extreme digital isolation' Iran is 10 days into one of the most extreme internet shutdowns in history, with 92 million citizens cut off from all internet services and even disruption to phone and text messaging. The Iranian government cut off services on 8 January, apparently to stifle dissent and prevent international scrutiny of a government crack down on protesters. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said the internet was cut off in response to what he described as externally directed "terrorist operations". The government has not said when internet services will return, but new reports suggest that, behind the scenes, the authorities may be making plans to restrict it permanently. On 15 January, the news website IranWire reported that government spokesperson Fatemeh Mohajerani told journalists that international web access will not be available until at least the Iranian New Year in late March. Internet freedom observers at FilterWatch believe the government is hastily implementing new systems and rules to cut Iran off from the international internet. "There should be no expectation of reopening international internet access, and even afterwards, users' access to international internet will never return to its previous form," FilterWatch said, citing unnamed government sources. While the BBC cannot independently verify this report or the timing of its implementation, journalists who spoke to BBC Persian also said they were told that internet access would not be restored anytime soon. From temporary outage to "communication black hole" Iran has maintained a tight grip over the internet for many years, with most western social media apps and platforms blocked, as well as external news websites like BBC News. However many people have managed to access popular apps such as Instagram using Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). Internet freedom campaigners at Access Now say Iran has consistently used shutdowns as a way to mask mass violence and brutal crackdowns on protesters, as seen during the nationwide internet shutdowns during the November 2019 and September 2022 protests. A shutdown was also imposed during the Iran-Israel conflict in June 2025. However, the current blackout has lasted longer than any previous shutdown. In a public statement, the charity Access Now said that full restoration of internet access is imperative. "Restricting access to these essential services not only endanger lives but embolden authorities to conceal and evade accountability for human rights abuses," it said. Already there are reports that livelihoods in Iran are being badly impacted by the shutdown with e-commerce particularly affected. As of 18 January, the Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) estimates that more than 3,300 confirmed protester deaths have been recorded, with more than 4,380 cases under review. It also reports that the number of arrests has reached 24,266 across 187 cities. The real number of people killed and detained is believed to be significantly higher, but the lack of access means the figures cannot be independently verified. Internet monitoring project, FilterWatch, says that the latest shutdown spells the start of a more extreme "digital isolation" and increased surveillance on what is said, sent and viewed online. Amir Rashidi, director of cyber security and digital rights at the Miaan Group, which runs FilterWatch, told the BBC he believes the authorities are moving towards a tiered system in which access to the global internet would no longer be automatic but subject to approval. Access would be granted through a registration and vetting process, he expects, adding that the technical infrastructure for such a system has been in place for years. Who decides about the Internet? According to FilterWatch, the plans are not being spoken about publicly, with key decisions increasingly concentrated within security bodies rather than civilian ministries. Protecting Iran from cyber attacks - of which there have been many high profile and disruptive cases in recent years - may be another motivation for the extreme moves. However, analysts caution that the plans may not fully materialise or could be applied unevenly due to internal power dynamics and broader economic and technical pressures. Amir Rashidi notes that risks to internet providers, alongside users' ability to adapt or migrate to alternative platforms, could further complicate implementation. If Iran goes ahead with the plans being reported on, it will be following similar systems in Russia and China. China has led the world on internet control not just with enormous state censorship over online discussion but also with what people are able to access abroad. The so-called Great Chinese Firewall blocks citizens from much of the global internet and all western apps like Facebook, Instagram and YouTube are not reachable without VPNs - but they are also becoming harder to use. In 2019, Russia began testing for a grand plan to create a similar system dubbed Ru-net. But unlike China, which built state control into the internet as the web spread decades ago, Russia is having to retrofit state control into complex systems. Russia is going a step further than China and planning to switch itself off from the world wide web with a "kill switch", which will apparently be used at times of crisis. The system will allow internal internet traffic and keep the country moving online but without traffic going outside or in - a digital border in effect. But it has yet to be fully tested. Where is internet in Iran heading? If the reports are accurate, it seems that Iran is planning to a quasi combination of permanent Chinese and Russian internet control. "In Iran there seems to be a move to isolate everyone from any electronic access, unless approved by the government," said computer security expert Prof Alan Woodward from Surrey University in the UK, after reviewing the reports of Iran's plans. He believes the Iranian regime has probably moved ahead with its longer term plans, using the current blackout as a reason to make the technical switches and orders now, whilst everything is cut off. Amir Rashidi says the question is no longer technical, but political - arguing that whether such systems are fully implemented now depends on political will. Starlink and other internet-from-space services, known as Low Earth Orbit (LEO), have also complicated control for Iran during the protests. LEO internet services allow users to get around all censorship and shutdowns by connecting via satellites. The government was able to jam and interfere with some Starlink users but it has been confirmed to the BBC that other terminals remain operational after the company updated its firmware to bypass government blocking efforts. The service, which is owned by Elon Musk, also waived subscription fees for Iranian users. In spite of the increasing tools being used by repressive regimes, Woodward is surprisingly optimistic about the future of internet. He cites advances in LEO and the fact that many phones can now use satellites even when the internet is down for things like SOS messages. There are also emerging apps that use mesh networks relying on Bluetooth, which can bring connectivity where there is none. "Its almost inevitable that internet access will be truly universal eventually but it'll always be cat and mouse for repressive regimes", Woodward says.

**Excerpt**

Syrian army seizes country's largest oil field from Kurdish forces Syrian troops fighting Kurdish forces in north-eastern Syria have seized the country's largest oilfield. The Omar facility and nearby gas fields are under army control after the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) pulled back, officials and monitors say. Earlier the army captured the strategic Tabqa dam on the Euphrates river. The push came after the SDF announced it would redeploy east of the Euphrates, following deadly clashes last week. That withdrawal followed talks with US officials. Ongoing fighting in the area stems from the breakdown of an agreement between SDF and the government of President Ahmed al-Sharaa, who is seeking to integrate Kurdish bodies into Syrian institutions. On Friday, in an apparent good-will gesture, al-Sharaa said he would make Kurdish a national language and make the Kurdish new year an official holiday. The decree is the first formal recognition of Kurdish national rights since Syria's independence in 1946. The US-backed SDF then announced its pullout east of the Euphrates river. Kurdish forces have been controlling swathes of Syria's oil-rich north and north-east, much of it gained during the fight against the Islamic State group over the past decade. Over the weekend, Syrian troops continued their eastward push. They entered the town of Tabqa on the south-western bank of the Euphrates and nearby dam on Saturday. On Sunday, Syrian officials announced they had seized Omar, Syria's largest oil field, on the eastern side of the river. The facility has been a major source of revenue for the SDF. This claim was supported by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group. It said the SDF had withdrawn from "entire villages and towns of the eastern countryside of Deir Ezzor [province]" as well as the Omar and Tanak oil fields early on Sunday. Meanwhile Syrian authorities accused the SDF of blowing up two bridges on the Euphrates River, including the new al-Rashid bridge in the city of Raqqa. Last week at least 12 people were reported killed in clashes between the two sides in the northern city of Aleppo. The latest fighting comes despite attempts by the US to broker a ceasefire. Washington has long backed the SDF, but it also supports the Syrian government. Following the ousting of longtime strongman Bashar al-Assad in late 2024, President al-Sharaa has been seeking to integrate Kurdish military and civilian bodies into Syria's national institutions. In March 2025, the SDF signed a deal with the government to that effect. Almost a year on, the agreement is still not implemented, with each side blaming the other.

Pakistan shopping mall fire kills six people A fire at a shopping centre in the Pakistan city of Karachi has killed six people as firefighters continue to battle the blaze. Parts of the Gul Plaza, containing 1,200 stores and spanning 8,000 sq m (86,111 sq ft), have collapsed which officers said was hampering rescue efforts. One firefighter is among the dead, more than 20 people have been injured and there are fears some are still trapped inside the multi-storey mall. Local emergency services said that when helpers arrived at the site on Saturday "the fire from the ground floor had spread to the upper floors, and almost the entire building was already engulfed in flames". Smoke was still billowing from what remains of the Gul Plaza building on Sunday morning. Hassan Khan, a spokesperson for Rescue 1122 in Karachi, told BBC Urdu the shopping centre contains flammable materials such as plastic foam, cloth, carpets and perfume. There are 20 fire engines trying to control the blaze but there are concerns the mall could collapse further. Summaiya Syed, Karachi's police surgeon, said six bodies had been transferred to the city's Civil Hospital as well as some of the injured. She added that the police were "invoking mass disaster protocols". Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari expressed his condolences and told the government of Sindh province, where Karachi is based, to conduct a comprehensive review of safety arrangements in commercial and residential buildings across the area.

**Excerpt**

Ugandan leader extends 40-year rule after winning contested poll Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni has been declared the winner of Thursday's election extending his four decades in power by another five years. He gained 72% of the vote, the election commission announced, against 25% for his closest challenger Bobi Wine, who has condemned what he described as "fake results" and "ballot stuffing". Wine has not provided any details and the authorities have not responded to his allegations, but African Union election observers said they saw "no evidence of ballot stuffing". Wine has called for non-violent protests. Museveni, 81, first came to power as a rebel leader in 1986 but since then has won seven elections. The election process was marred by violence and Wine, a 43-year-old former pop star, says that at least 21 people have been killed around the country in recent days. The authorities have so far confirmed seven deaths. Announcing the results, electoral commission head Simon Byabakama asked supporters of both factions to embrace unity and accept the results. Beyond the national tallying centre, there have been minimal celebrations, with most roads in the capital, Kampala, empty and businesses closed. However, pockets of violence have been reported in several neighbourhoods. Access to the internet has been cut in the country since Tuesday, making it hard to verify information. The authorities say the blackout was necessary to prevent misinformation, fraud and the incitement of violence - a move condemned by the UN human rights office as "deeply worrying". Wine has demanded that the internet be restored. Leading the African Union observer mission, Nigeria's former President Goodluck Jonathan told journalists that "the government should refrain from the suspension of internet access" close to the election. He also denounced "reports of intimidation, arrest and abductions" saying they "instilled fear and eroded public trust in the electoral process", AFP news agency reports. Speaking to the BBC, Wine's assistant Dan Magic alleged that security personnel entered the opposition leader's home on Thursday night in order to take him. It is not clear what happened next, but Magic said that Wine's whereabouts were unknown. Wine had previously said he was under house arrest. On Saturday, he posted a statement on Facebook saying he had evaded an attempt to seize him. This has not been confirmed by the police but spokesman Kituuma Rusoke said the politician's movements had been restricted because his home was an area of "security interest". "We have controlled access to areas which are security hotspots," Uganda's Daily Monitor paper quoted him as saying. "We cannot allow people to use some places to gather and cause chaos," he said. Wine says he represents the youth in a country where most of the population is aged under 30. During the campaign, he promised to tackle corruption and impose sweeping reforms, while Museveni argued that he was the sole guarantor of stability in Uganda, a country with a history of conflict. There were six other candidates but none got more than 2% of the vote. Turnout was 52.5%. The campaign period was marred by the disruption of opposition activities - security forces have been accused of assaulting and detaining Wine's supporters. Rusoke, the police spokesperson, dismissed these complaints, accusing opposition supporters of being disruptive.

### 5. [Iran supreme leader acknowledges thousands killed during recent protests](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckglee733wno?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

Iran supreme leader acknowledges thousands killed during recent protests Iran's supreme leader has for the first time publicly acknowledged that thousands of people were killed during recent protests. In a speech on Saturday, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said thousands had been killed, "some in an inhuman, savage manner", and blamed the US for the deaths. A violent response to the unrest has claimed 3,090 lives, according to US-based Iranian Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), with some activist groups putting the death toll far higher. An internet blackout has made it extremely difficult to get clear information. US President Donald Trump recently urged Iranian demonstrators to "keep protesting" and threatened military intervention if security forces kill them. "Those linked to Israel and the US caused massive damage and killed several thousand," Khamenei said, quoted by Iranian state media. "We consider the US president criminal for the casualties, damages and slander he inflicted on the Iranian nation." The protests, which began on 28 December over the economy, have turned into calls for the end of the rule of Iran's supreme leader. The Iranian government has called the demonstrations "riots" backed by Iran's enemies. Protesters have been met with deadly force and videos of security forces shooting at demonstrations have been authenticated by both BBC Persian and BBC Verify. There has also been a near-total shutdown of the internet and communication services in Iran. On Saturday overall connectivity remained at about 2% of ordinary levels, according to cyber monitor NetBlocks. There have been fewer reports of unrest in recent days but with internet access still restricted developments on the ground remain unclear. A woman in Shiraz, south-western Iran, told BBC Persian that "security forces are still patrolling on motorbikes to keep the situation under control, but overall things have gone back to normal". During his speech on Saturday, Khamenei also said Iran considered President Trump to be a "criminal" and said the US must be "held accountable" for recent unrest. He also claimed on social media that "America's goal is to swallow Iran". Trump has not yet responded to the supreme leader and the BBC has approached the White House for a comment. The US state department said on Saturday that it had "heard reports that the Islamic Republic is preparing options to target American bases". It said Iran would be met with "a very, very powerful force" if it launched such an attack and warned Tehran not to "play games with President Trump". The US president said on Wednesday he had been told "the killing in Iran has stopped", but added that he had not ruled out military action against the country. His comments came after the US and UK both reduced the number of personnel at the Al-Udeid air base in Qatar. Officials told CBS, the BBC's US partner, that a partial American withdrawal was a "precautionary measure".

### 6. [Big names on Trump's peace panel face huge challenges in Gaza](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c07xvv9r422o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

Big names on Trump's peace panel face huge challenges in Gaza The White House has announced the first members of its Gaza "Board of Peace", and the list of names will do little to dispel the criticism from some quarters that the US president's plan resembles, at its heart, a colonial solution imposed over the heads of the Palestinians. There are still several unknowns - namely who else might be added, and the exact structure of what is currently a rather complicated layout. So far, no Palestinian names are included on the two separate senior boards that have been officially unveiled. One is a "founding Executive Board", with a high-level focus on investment and diplomacy. The other, called the "Gaza Executive Board", is responsible for overseeing all on-the-ground work of yet another administrative group, the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG). That committee is made up of supposedly technocratic, apolitical Palestinians, led by Dr Ali Shaath, a civil engineer by training who's held ministerial positions in the Palestinian Authority. But of the seven members of the founding Executive Board, six are Americans - including US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other members of Trump's inner circle like his son-in-law Jared Kushner, and Steve Witkoff, who is US Special Envoy to the Middle East, but also a friend of the president and a fellow real estate developer. Ajay Banga, president of the World Bank, is something of an exception as an Indian-born US citizen. Sir Tony Blair, meanwhile, is a former UK Prime Minister, and his inclusion is likely to further fuel concerns about how the Board of Peace will operate. Over the past few weeks, criticism of Sir Tony's possible inclusion has come from figures like prominent politician Mustafa Barghouti, general secretary of the Palestinian National Initiative, and newspaper reports quoting unnamed officials from Arab states in the region. Sir Tony's central role in the Iraq war, coupled with Britain's own colonial history in the Middle East, is deemed by his opponents to make him entirely unsuitable. Francesca Albanese, the United Nations' special rapporteur on human rights in the occupied Palestinian territories, wrote on social media last year: "Tony Blair? Hell no. Hands off Palestine." Even Trump seemed to acknowledge the issue. "I've always liked Tony, but I want to find out that he's an acceptable choice to everybody," the president said last October. There is significant overlap between the two senior boards, with Kushner, Witkoff and Sir Tony appearing on both. But the Gaza Executive Board does include the names of some senior political figures and diplomats from Turkey, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. It will be headed by the former Bulgarian politician, Nickolay Mladenov, who's been given the title of High Representative for Gaza. Yakir Gabay, a businessman born in Israel and now based in Cyprus is the only Israeli member. In its statement announcing the names, the White House said those chosen will work to ensure "effective governance and the delivery of best-in-class services that advance peace, stability, and prosperity for the people of Gaza". And whatever the concerns and complexities, the plan remains the only game in town, with many world leaders pledging their support and commitment to helping make it a success. Its architecture is further complicated by the fact that, sitting above all the structures announced so far, will be the Board of Peace itself, with President Trump as the chairman. Names of that supreme body have not yet been announced, but the current UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Egypt's Abdel Fattah El-Sisi and Canadian leader Mark Carney have reportedly been invited to join. In the end, whether the most vocal critics can be assuaged will depend on how quickly the new members of the senior teams can begin to drive change that makes a real difference in both daily life for Palestinians and, crucially, further concrete steps towards a lasting peace. Major challenges remain to both of those goals. The UN estimates around 80% of buildings in Gaza have been destroyed or damaged and families who have survived the war are now struggling with the winter weather, and a lack of food and shelter. While aid groups say there has been some improvements, they accuse Israel of imposing continuing restrictions upon their work. Israel says that it is facilitating humanitarian assistance, and has blamed the UN for failing to distribute supplies already in Gaza. It argues any restrictions are designed to stop Hamas infiltrating and exploiting relief efforts. Showing meaningful progress towards rebuilding will also be a Herculean task, involving not only the removal of an estimated 60 million tonnes of rubble, but first finding and disposing of the dead bodies and unexploded bombs contained within it. Perhaps the biggest challenge though is maintaining the fraying ceasefire itself. Another name has been released by the White House, that of Major General Jasper Jeffers as the Commander of the International Stabilization Force (ISF). Backed by a UN mandate, it will have the tough job of ensuring the demilitarisation of Gaza. As yet, there's no clear road map for how Hamas will be persuaded to give up its weapons, nor any clear idea of which country will provide troops for that force or what its remit and rules of engagement will be. Hamas has said it will only disarm as part of a wider deal establishing a Palestinian state. Israel, whose ground troops still control more than half of the Gaza Strip, has said it will only withdraw if Hamas disarms. How that catch-22 can be resolved is perhaps the biggest test of all.
