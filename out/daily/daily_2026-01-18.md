Around 1,500 soldiers on standby for deployment to Minneapolis, officials say Soldiers are on standby for possible deployment to Minneapolis, a US defence official has told CBS News, the BBC's US partner. The official said the 1,500 soldiers, currently in Alaska, are an option for US president Donald Trump if he decided to use active duty military personnel, as anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) demonstrations continued in the city on Saturday. No decision has yet been made on whether to deploy the soldiers from Alaska, the official said. Minnesota officials have urged protesters to stay orderly and peaceful during demonstrations after an ICE agent shot dead US citizen Renee Good earlier this month. The soldiers are part of the 11th Airborne Division in Fort Wainwright, the official added. Last week, Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act, a rarely-used law that allows active-duty military personnel to be deployed for law enforcement duties inside the US. It comes as a US federal judge issued an order limiting the crowd control tactics that can used by ICE agents towards "peaceful and unobstructive" protesters in Minneapolis. Judge Katherine Menendez earlier ruled that federal agents cannot arrest or pepper spray peaceful demonstrations, including those monitoring or observing ICE agents. The state's National Guard has been mobilised and placed on alert by Governor Tim Walz, and other law enforcement officers were deployed to Minneapolis ahead of the anti-ICE demonstrations. Recent protests in the city were sparked by widespread action by ICE in the city, and follow Good's death on 7 January. City leaders said Good was there as a legal observer of ICE activity. But the Trump administration has called her a "domestic terrorist". Good's death sparked protests across the country, with many people holding signs that read "Justice for Renee".

**Excerpt**

Gangland killing at a funeral shocks idyllic French island The mourners had gathered in the small village of Vero, a half-hour drive from Ajaccio, the capital of the picture-postcard Mediterranean island of Corsica. In their midst was former nationalist leader Alain Orsoni, 71, who had flown in from exile in Nicaragua to bury his mother. Suddenly, with the ceremony under way, a single shot was fired from nearby scrubland, killing Orsoni instantly. Thirty-five people have been fatally shot on this island of 350,000 people in the past three years alone, giving it one of France's highest murder rates. Corsicans have become wearily familiar with vendettas and tit-for-tat underworld shootings, but even here, the way Orsoni was killed has stunned islanders. Yesterday, Alain Orsoni was cremated after a funeral service in Ajaccio. There was a large police presence. Close friend Jo Peraldi finds it hard to believe that a day of high emotion surrounding the funeral of Orsoni's mother could have been defiled in such a way. "A cemetery is sacred in Corsica, just like a church. Never have I witnessed seeing someone murdered while accompanying their mother to their final resting place," he told Corsican radio. Peraldi had seen his friend on the morning of the funeral. Like Orsoni, he had been an active figure in Corsican nationalism, spending 15 years in jail for organising bomb attacks against symbols of the French state. Over the years, victims of Corsica's violence have included farmers, elected officials, a lawyer, local business owners and even the president of the chamber of commerce. But for a cousin of the victim, Christian Leca, Orsoni's killing was "a tipping point in the horror". "People don't kill in cemeteries, it's intolerable," he told Le Monde newspaper. The nature of the violence has changed in recent times, says Thierry Dominici, an expert of Corsican nationalism at the University of Bordeaux who grew up on the island. "Once armed groups gave up their violent campaign for autonomy or independence, they kept their weapons and turned to organised crime instead," he told the BBC. "The French state was so focused on tackling the separatists that it turned a blind eye to their lucrative criminal activities." But he believes there is a significant difference between Corsica's organised crime and the role of the mafia in parts of southern Italy. "In Corsica the clans are not linked by family ties or rituals of lifelong loyalty, but by simple opportunism," Dominici says. Judges in Paris specialised in tackling organised crime are running the investigation into Orsoni's shooting alongside the regional prosecutor's office in Marseille. "This murder increases the mafia pressure that weighs heavily on Corsican society," says Gilles Simeoni who, as president of Corsica's regional authority, holds the island's highest elected position. "Orsoni was a major contemporary figure in Corsican nationalism both out in the open and and in the shadows." His killing has reverberated far beyond Corsica. The Orsoni family are a household name on the island and they have been long linked to nationalism as well as episodes of violence. In his younger years, Alain Orsoni spent time in jail for bomb attacks aimed at putting pressure on the French state to grant the island more autonomy. But the nationalist movement split into different groups and increasingly turned to money laundering, extortion, protection rackets, drug trafficking and violence to win lucrative state-run contracts. Orsoni's brother, Guy, was killed by a rival clan in 1983 and his son is in jail for drug trafficking and attempted murder. He narrowly escaped being killed several times and fled to Central America at the height of one of the particularly violent feuds, turning his attention instead to investing in casinos. He knew his life was in constant danger. I saw it first-hand when I spent two days with him back in 2012 for the BBC. A big football fan, he had moved back from Central America to run one of the local football clubs AC Ajaccio. Under his presidency, AC Ajaccio were even promoted to the top flight of French football, Ligue 1. Big signings were made during the club's heyday, including former Mexico goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa. When I asked Orsoni how he managed to attract star players despite having the smallest budget in Ligue 1, he cracked a smile: "Corsica is a nice place to play and I guess I am quite persuasive." At the time, he wore a bullet-proof vest and was driven around in an armored car with tinted windows. Rather than sit in a grand office with big windows overlooking the beautiful Bay of Ajaccio, the club president worked in a windowless, concrete bunker deep inside the building. When I suggested we go for a tour of the town, he categorically said no, it wasn't safe. He was renowned for his good looks and sing-song southern accent, as well as a passing resemblance to the late actor and showman Yves Montand. But his easy going smile could suddenly turn to an eerie silence. When I asked him if his reputation as the godfather of Corsica was true, he replied: "Yes, I'm the godfather, but only to my grandchildren." As we talked, surrounded by tough-looking men in leather jackets, boots and jeans, I attempted to crack a joke that fell flat. After a long, uneasy pause, Orsoni broke the silence with a chuckle and his henchmen followed suit. His eye-catching role in French football gave him a VIP pass to grounds across the country. He rubbed shoulders with mainstream dignitaries and establishment figures, including ex-President Nicolas Sarkozy, who rarely missed a home game at Paris Saint-Germain. A local prefect once told me of his distaste at the thought that Orsoni could be profiting from his new stage to show a more respectable side. "It's true I have an unusual background for some one to be a football club president and I can understand that some people are shocked," Orsoni admitted. "But I can tell you that people's impressions can change when you meet them." Not long after my visit, I talked to his lawyer, Antoine Sollacaro. Weeks later he was murdered at a petrol station in Ajaccio. In recent years, the club had fallen on hard times. Although Orsoni was still president until only a few months ago, he had moved back to Nicaragua. Why would anyone want an exiled ex-nationalist football figure dead? The list is long, according to police, and vendettas go back a long way in Corsica. Alain Bauer, a professor of criminology who has advised successive French governments on security issues, said his killing was inevitable and could herald further violence. "That Alain Orsoni was killed does not surprise me, it was just a question of when not if," Bauer told the BBC. "But the circumstances behind it are shocking. An assassination in a graveyard in Corsica is surprising and it's pretty certain there will be revenge killings. In the end the main victims are the Corsicans themselves." There are few figures more unifying in Corsica than the bishop of Ajaccio, Cardinal François Bustillo, who persuaded the late Pope Francis to visit to the island in December 2024, a few months before his death. This week he called for an end to the bloodletting. "We mustn't get used to this eye-for-an-eye, tooth-for-a-tooth violence. We cannot allow Corsica to drift towards its demons, we have to change mentalities," he said. The question is whether his plea will be heard.

**Excerpt**

A deadly fire swept through a nightclub in just 90 seconds. I got out Warning: This article contains themes you may find upsetting Gina Russo was watching a gig with her husband-to-be, Fred Crisostomi, one night in 2003 when she realised something wasn't right. Great White, an 80s hair-rock band, had opened their set with a thrash of guitar chords, as four large pyrotechnic flares shot out from the stage. The flares instantly set fire to the surrounding acoustic foam panels, installed to deaden the sound. "It was immediate," Gina tells BBC News. "It got bad very fast. The backflash just happened that quick." Then came "a black rain of smoke", Gina adds, the heat melting, then shattering, glass lights above people's heads. Gina and her fiance made for the nearest exit, a door to the right of the club's small stage. A bouncer blocked their way, but Gina has no idea why. That's when "a stampede" began for the main exit, she says, and Fred desperately pushed her ahead in the crowd. Gina says "bodies were piling up" as people scrambled to get out - and her last memory was making it through the door to safety before passing out. When she woke from an induced coma 11 weeks later, Gina learned her fiance had saved her life but had lost his in the fire. This was at The Station nightclub in the snowy town of West Warwick, Rhode Island, on the east coast of the United States. Some 22 years on, there was a near-identical event at Le Constellation bar in the equally snowy ski resort of Crans-Montana, Switzerland, in the early hours of New Year's Day 2026. At The Station nightclub, 100 people died and at Le Constellation, 40, mainly young people, lost their lives. Many survivors of both fires have severe burn injuries. The two disasters have striking similarities, and not only in their appalling impact on victims. Both were caused by indoor pyrotechnics, experts say. Victims appear to have had little time to find an escape route, and foam panels may have spread the Swiss fire in an identical way to The Station nightclub fire. UK fire investigation consultant Richard Hagger was quick to compare the two tragedies. He is "99% certain" the Swiss fire was triggered by the sparklers. He says if the foam had been fire retardant it would have smouldered, not burned. These similarities raise the questions: do we really understand how dangerous such situations are? And what should we do if we find ourselves caught up in one? A matter of seconds to escape In both the Rhode Island and Swiss tragedies, a "flashover fire" is thought to have taken hold. This is when hot air rises, but as the heat and smoke reach the ceiling there is nowhere for it to go. So it spreads downwards, quickly igniting furniture, clothes and skin. In 2003, Phil Barr was 22, back home in Rhode Island for a winter break after living in New York. He was set on a career on Wall Street, but Phil loved a loud rock band, so going to see Great White that night sounded, well, great. He got there early and when his friend arrived shortly before show time, Phil grabbed him a beer and excitedly propelled him to the front of the crowd. As the fire began, the band's lead singer turned and said, calmly over the PA system: "Wow, that's not good." It wasn't. Phil describes the moment of the "flashover", saying flames quickly "got overhead, and it was above me". "All of a sudden, everything's on fire, I could sort of see an orange glow, behind heavy black smoke but not much else," he adds. "It went from feeling the heat of flame to feeling like your entire body's in an oven." In an attempt to escape, Phil ended up slamming his burning body at a side door and falling out into the snow, and safety. He suffered life-threatening respiratory damage. In an incredible coincidence, a camera crew from a local TV station was in the club, filming a video about venue safety. Their 12-minute footage of the fire shows it took just 25 seconds for flames to reach the ceiling, and within 90 seconds, toxic smoke had filled the building. With the doorway then blocked by people piling on top of each other and black smoke pouring from the windows, the video suggests leaving straight away gave them the best chance of survival. Prof Ed Galea, one of the world's leading experts on fire and the way people react to it, explains how heat coming from the flammable foam acoustic panels covering the ceiling in The Station nightclub fire made the situation much worse. "It's a nightmare situation when the fuel is in the ceiling. You don't have the advantage of the time it takes for the fire to develop. It's already in the ceiling. You've got an instant hot layer and when flashover happens, survivability in any space is unlikely," he says. As part of the investigation into what happened at The Station nightclub, experts from the US National Institute of Standards and Technology built a laboratory version of the club and set it alight. Their official report found flashover conditions were reached after about 65 seconds. After 90 seconds "conditions in the middle of the room... were found to be lethal". Galea built on these findings, inputting the layout of The Station club into a computer simulator he created which predicts how fires spread. It showed a rapidly expanding burst of heated air, with temperatures inside the club reaching 700C within 80 seconds. While the official investigation into the Swiss disaster is ongoing, footage gathered to date suggests this blaze also engulfed the room in a matter of seconds, spreading across the foam-lined ceiling. Swiss authorities say the fire is believed to have been started by sparklers attached to champagne bottles raised too close to the ceiling during celebrations, and that the bar had not undergone safety checks for five years. Fire requires three things: heat, fuel and oxygen. And in a fire such as this, there is a window of seconds to make the decision to get out, before the flashover happens, Galea says. But every disaster Prof Galea has studied has convinced him that people underestimate the speed with which fires can spread. 'Chance favours the prepared mind' "We call it friendly fire syndrome," he says. "We are not exposed to fire on an everyday basis any more, as we used to be 100 years ago when we were experienced at starting fires for cooking. We have lost all of that connection to how rapidly fire can develop." Hagger says "some people will stand and physically watch the fire, fixated by what they are seeing. They don't physically perceive the danger. Some will film it, some will even try to hide, rather than escaping." In a famous study from 1968, psychologists Bibb Latané and John Darley recruited male Columbia University students and asked them to fill in a form while smoke was pumped into the room. The researchers measured how many students stepped out to raise the alarm. When they were in the room alone, 75% reacted to the smoke by raising the alarm. But when two other people were with them - who were in on the experiment and had been told not to react - just 10% of the subjects reported the possible fire. The authors concluded that sometimes an "individual seeing the inaction of others, will judge the situation as less serious than he would be if he were alone". In The Station fire, crucial seconds passed before both Gina and Phil decided to get out, almost like they were waiting for something to happen. "My initial reaction to the fire was, 'Oh, that's interesting'," Phil says. "It almost looked like it was just sitting on the surface. It was going to burn out." "We've been conditioned to believe that there are fire sprinklers or extinguishers nearby, right? I remember thinking at one point, 'We're all going to get wet'. Obviously that didn't happen." The Station nightclub did not have them. Phil's account suggests others in the crowd may have reacted only when the sudden and devastating flashover happened. "You exit a fire in an orderly fashion. You don't push," Phil adds. But when people realised, "it just turned into chaos." Gina says it was the fire alarm triggering, which made people react - almost as if they had to be told to leave. In the Swiss fire, footage showed some young party-goers filming the early stages of the fire or trying to put out the flames by waving jackets. On social media, some questioned their actions and were criticised for being insensitive. Galea says the way they acted was nothing to do with their age. "People are saying, 'It's Gen Z, they don't know what they are doing', but it has been happening ever since I started doing research about this," he says. He has a mantra, which, he says, should guide anyone's thinking when it comes to their safety in a fire: "Chance favours the prepared mind. You improve your chances by being prepared. Always look for the means of escape." Preventing another tragedy According to Galea's decades of research, there have been 38 similar fires claiming about 1,200 lives since the year 2000. Fifteen involved some form of pyrotechnics and about 13 involved acoustic foam or decorative materials. Given these precedents, some may wonder why we do not appear to be learning the lessons. While there are shared fire testing specifications, and an industry dedicated to improving safety, there is no internationally enforced "fire code". The risk is that a fire in one country does not lead to action to prevent a very similar fire happening in another. After the 2017 Grenfell Tower disaster in London, a public inquiry found the London Fire Brigade had been broadly aware of fires involving flammable cladding around the world, but had failed to properly prepare staff to deal with one. Compare that with the international aviation industry, which has the advantage of being highly centralised. Air crashes are independently investigated, the findings shared globally, and international directives issued to fix problems, resulting in a good safety record. Gina and Phil still live with the scars they received in The Station fire. Some 80 of the Swiss fire victims remain in hospitals in Switzerland and other countries. Before that night in 2003, Phil was a competitive swimmer, but the smoke badly damaged his lungs. "I had this fight to get my life back, he says. "I was not going to let these injuries hold me back or define me. "I look at that moment and I say, 'This is what I almost lost'," Phil says. "I realised I need to go out and put the effort into the things which really matter." Gina still mourns Fred, whom she lost that night. She now has a new partner - her husband is a retired firefighter.

I want to show the world what Africa is - YouTube star brings joy and tears on tour One of the world's most popular content creators has been attracting huge crowds, mostly his young fans, as he undertakes a 20-nation tour of Africa, a continent he says is "full of surprises". Pre-teen boys in Rwanda and Ethiopia cried with joy and excitement as they hugged their online hero in real life - known by his gamer tag IShowSpeed or simply Speed, who now has more than 48 million YouTube subscribers. He is famous for his high-tempo, frenetic and totally unscripted broadcasts that last anything from three to 11 hours. African Americans have also been moved to see the outpouring of love and respect shown to their countryman, who will turn 21 during his "Speed Does Africa" tour. In Eswatini he was given the name "Logijimako" - meaning "the one who runs" - during an initiation ceremony at a royal palace for him to become a warrior who protects the king and family. Others on social media have named him "Speedani". Speed, whose real name is Darren Watkins Jr, was himself momentarily overwhelmed by the reaction of people in Angola - the first country he visited - where one fan recreated on the beach a meme of Speed's "my mom's kinda homeless" face. "Bro, I'm not going to lie," he told the chat - the fans watching and commenting on his YouTube livestream. "I love the love in Africa. The energy here is crazy." Over 28 days, he and his team of recording, security and logistics people plan to visit 20 countries in Africa, including Nigeria, Ivory Coast, Liberia and Ghana. He is planning to see the sights, learn some history, explore daily life, culture and food, play sport, perform high-risk stunts, meet fans and lookalikes, meet some ministers of tourism - and generally experience whoever and whatever comes his way as he speed-walks and livestreams. "I want to show the world what Africa really is," Speed declared during his South Africa stop - where he went car-spinning, learned some amapiano dance moves and got scratched by a cheetah. Some have dismissed the tour as a superficial gimmick - with the streams only benefitting himself. In the AskAnAfrican Reddit forum, Bakyumu from Niger described the tour as a "fleeting spectacle" by someone who is ultimately an "entertainer". Speed started as a gamer, becoming very well-known in 2022, before moving into in-real-life and football content. His meteoric rise has not been without controversy. He is permanently banned from all Riot Games' online tournaments after a sexist tirade against a female player. He apologised and acknowledged he was wrong. He was also once banned from YouTube for a week for enabling his game character to engage in inappropriate sexual activity in full display of viewers. Speed has built his brand and online persona on over-the-top, boisterous and sometimes aggressive reactions. As well as barking, back flips and athletic stunts - like jumping over moving cars - his stock phrases include "What the..." and "Siuuu", a nod to his footballing hero Cristiano Ronaldo, which he shouts out in celebration or excitement. GenZ-ers and the younger GenAlpha-ers love his raw, uncensored content - where almost anything can and sometimes does happen live on air. "I really enjoy the kind of energy he has and the things he does," Zambian fan Chinyama Yonga told the BBC. "Even the weird barks that he does," laughs the 16-year-old, who braved a rainstorm to see Speed in action. In Zambia, Speed plunged in the Devil's Pool on the very edge of the Mosi-oa-Tunya, or Victoria Falls, and rapped with Zambian hip-hop pioneer Slapdee. He also got a haircut at a barbers in a township in the capital, Lusaka - to the delight of thousands of people who flocked there as news spread on social media. "He is just himself - and it's so different to the usual heavily scripted and professionally edited videos," Chinyama said. A young relative of mine is a huge fan of Speed and was keen to tell me why the YouTuber appeals to youngsters around the world. "He's really funny; he's really good at doing backflips and he's really kind. He donates money and he goes out of his way to help people who are in trouble," said Henry Dale, who is 11 years old, and goes to school in the UK. Allow Google YouTube content? I watched the almost four-hour long livestream in Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital, and was mostly intrigued by the sometimes chaotic encounters and activities. Speed, dressed in shorts and his trademark number seven football shirt - this time in the yellow of Ethiopia - dashed around the city. He went to the Merkato, the city's main market, to haggle for a traditional "shamma" or shawl, to the Ethiopian Science Museum, where he crashed a simulator plane, to the Adwa Victory Memorial, where he walked barefoot to honour the Ethiopian warriors who defeated Italian forces in 1896. On learning that the country uses its own Ge'ez calendar, he exclaimed: "Wait! It's... 2018. I'm only 13? Ronaldo is still at Real Madrid?" Speed also danced with traditional dancers, known for their energetic, fast-paced "eskista" or dancing shoulders. That was a standout moment for 33-year-old hotel manager Yonaiel Tadiwos. "His energy when it came to engaging with all dancers was amazing," Yonaiel told the BBC. He also praised Speed for being "bold enough to try a large amount of raw meat" - a local delicacy with deep historical roots. The Speed epic walkabouts have not been without mishaps, like in Zimbabwe's capital, Harare. When Miss Universe Zimbabwe came out to greet him, the beauty queen was accidentally overlooked in the chaos of the moment. Some fans who have rushed in to hug and take selfies with Speed have been swiftly thrown to the ground by his security team. And Speed cut short a rare solemn moment in Addis Ababa when he was visiting the tomb of the Emperor Haile Selassie - because of the internet connection lagging. Yonaiel, one of the Ethiopian local organisers, was delighted that Speed included his country "as many creators don't give us a chance due to misperceptions about Ethiopia". But Bakyumu on Reddit is more critical. "Seeing the local crowds deify him feels tragic because it highlights a desperate need for escapism. "This isn't meaningful cultural exchange. It is a momentary distraction from systemic misery," Bakyumu says, referring to things like poor housing and unemployment that millions in Africa deal with every day. But for Yonaiel, the visit has had the impact that he had hoped for. "People from across the world are talking about our country with only positive things to say." "We knew we could rewrite the narrative with even just a day of streaming." Can one visit by one streamer - no matter how big - change enough perceptions to really shift global narratives towards the continent of Africa? It is a start, said Samba Yonga, the mother of Zambian teenager Chinyama. "Speed has activated an internal compass in many young people - across the diaspora and on the continent - who have been quietly searching for belonging, pride and collective identity."

Avalanches kill five off-piste skiers in Austrian Alps Five off-piste skiers have died in two avalanches in the Austria's Alps following heavy snowfall in the region. An avalanche hit a group of seven skiers in the Pongau area near Salzburg, killing four and seriously injuring one on Saturday, local mountain rescue officials said. A similar avalanche swept away a skier in the same area earlier in the day. Poor conditions have led to the recent deaths of a number of people in the Alps over the last week. In the latest incidents, the mountain rescue service said it was alerted around 14:00 local time (13:00 GMT). Four people were found dead, while another suffered serious injuries, they said. Around an hour and a half before, a female skier was buried by an avalanche in open alpine terrain near the same area. "Our deepest sympathies go out to the families. This tragedy painfully demonstrates how serious the current avalanche situation is," said Gerhard Kremser, district head of the Pongau mountain rescue service. Further avalanches were recorded in the Pongau region around midday, but no-one was injured. On Tuesday, an avalanche killed a 13-year-old Czech boy skiing in the Austrian Alpine resort of Bad Gastein. Last Sunday, 58-year-old skier died in an avalanche in the Tyrolean resort of Weerberg in western Austria. In neighbouring Switzerland, a German man was killed in an avalanche, and four other people were injured, as they were cross-country skiing on Friday. Last weekend in France, six skiers died after being caught in avalanches in various Alpine resorts.

**Excerpt**

From surge in patriotism to fewer US trips - Trump's impact on Canada In the year since US President Donald Trump was inaugurated for his second term, he has brought with him significant global shifts. Like many countries, Canada - America's closest neighbour to the north - has felt the impact and seen a change in the long-standing relationship with its close security ally and trading partner. Trump has imposed tariffs on several key Canadian sectors and has warned of more to come. He has also referred to Canada as "the 51st state" — a jab that has been met with a mix of anxiety and an uncharactaristically fierce display of patriotism. He has had an effect not just on how Canadians shop and travel, but on the country's domestic politics and world view. Here are five ways Trump has had an impact on Canada. A shift in how Canadians see the US While the relationship between the two countries has had its ups and downs, many Canadians shop, travel and even work in the US, and have family ties to the country. But the past 12 months has seen a change in Canadians' overall attitudes towards the US, if not towards Americans themselves. Polling conducted by the Pew Research Center last spring indicated that 64% of Canadians held a negative view of the US in 2025 — the highest ever recorded in more than two decades of polling by Pew. This is a reversal from how they felt before the second Trump administration, when the majority said they held a favourable view of their neighbour. The survey suggested an even larger percentage of Canadians, around 77%, lack confidence in Trump as a president. Nine-in-10 respondents described him as "arrogant", and three-quarters said they believe he is "dangerous". A separate Angus Reid poll from October suggests that nearly half of Canadians (46%) want their government to approach the US as an "enemy or potential threat". This is higher than for India (24%) or China (34%). Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has sought to improve the relationship with both of those countries after years of tensions related, among other issues, to allegations of foreign interference. A more recent Leger poll conducted earlier this month indicates that one in three Canadians believe the US could take "direct action" to control Canada in the future. The poll was in response to the US seizure this month of former Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro and Trump's renewed comments on taking control of Greenland. Fewer trips south The US has long been the number one travel destination for Canadians — an unsurprising statistic given the proximity of two countries. While it remains a top destination, the number of Canadians making trips south has dropped by more than 25%, according to the latest data by Statistics Canada. That decline has been noticed by the American tourism industry, which forecast a loss of $5.7bn (£4.3bn) in tourism spending in 2025 compared to the previous year. Some jurisdictions, like California, have even run advertisements to try to entice Canadians back. But many have opted to vacation at home, with the domestic tourism sector reporting a record-breaking C$59bn ($42bn) in revenues from May to August, up 6% from the same period last year, according to Destination Canada, a national tourism organisation. Others have gone to Mexico, with national data showing a 12% surge in Canadians visiting Mexican cities in the last year. Buying more local products The boycott has extended to store shelves, with more Canadians now choosing local products in the face of US tariffs. Nowhere is this more significant than in liquor stores, where American alcohol was pulled from shelves by most provinces in retaliation against Trump's levies. Overall exports of US spirits fell 9% in the last quarter of 2025 compared to the same period last year, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States. In Canada, the value of US liquor imports dropped from $63.1bn in late 2024 to just over $9.5bn in late 2025. Canadians are also buying more Mexican-made cars, with vehicle imports from Mexico surpassing American imports for the very first time as of July, according to data from Statistics Canada. There's even a push to "Buy Canadian" at the federal government level, with Carney prioritising procurement from domestic suppliers, a move tailored to help specific sectors hard-hit by Trump's tariffs on products like steel and lumber. That includes in defence procurement, with Canada seeking to shift away from US suppliers as it significantly ramps up defence spending to meet its Nato commitments. An up-ended federal election Before Trump's second term, Canada's governing Liberal Party appeared headed towards a potentially historic collapse in the upcoming federal election. Polls at the time consistently showed the opposition Conservatives leading by a wide margin with party leader Pierre Poilievre, whose focus on affordability was resonating with voters, likely to be the next prime minister. Then the political script in Canada flipped. Former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau resigned in January - an exit hastened in part to his finance minister publicly quitting in protest over his handling of Trump. That made way for Carney, a former central banker with political ambitions, to run for the party's leadership. Carney leaned heavily on his economic experience as he campaigned as the man who could stand up to Trump, and voters, anxious about Canada's sovereignty and economy in face of the new US administration, flocked back to the Liberals. In late April's election, Carney achieved what was unthinkable just a few months prior: another return to power for the Liberals, with voters giving the party a few seats shy of a majority government. The Conservatives, meanwhile, lost their fourth consecutive election and Poilievre faces a leadership review later this month. The latest polling indicates that Carney's Liberals are a few points ahead of the Conservatives, though the gap between them has narrowed. Making new friends and allies With the Canada-US trade relationship increasingly unpredictable, Canada is seeking to bolster ties elsewhere, in some cases mending strained ties. This shift is perhaps most notable with Carney's visit to China this week — the first by a Canadian prime minister since 2017. On Friday, Carney announced a deal that would reduce tariffs between the two countries and increase access to each other's markets. In Beijing, he struck a pragmatic tone, saying that Canada is forming a "strategic partnership" with the Asian power that will bring economic benefits to both countries. It was a remarkable shift in tone by Carney, who on the campaign trail called China Canada's the biggest security threat. Asked by reporters about his concerns over national security and human rights, the prime minister responded with: "We take the world as it is, not as we wish it to be." Carney is also expected to embark on a trade mission to India in the next few weeks. The trip would be a further thawing of Canada-India relations, which have been icy since Trudeau openly accused Indian agents of being behind the extra-judicial killing of a Sikh separatist on Canadian soil. In the past year, Carney has also made trips to the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, as well as a number of European countries, in search for new trade relationships.
