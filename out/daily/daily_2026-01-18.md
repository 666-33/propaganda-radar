At least 21 killed in Spain after crash involving high-speed trains At least 21 people have been killed and dozens more injured following a collision between two high-speed trains in southern Spain on Sunday evening, officials say. The incident happened near the town of Adamuz, close to the city of Cordoba, when a high-speed train travelling from Malaga to Madrid derailed and crashed onto a neighbouring track, rail network operator Adif said. A second train travelling in the opposite direction, from Madrid to Huelva, also derailed. Andalusian emergency services said at least 25 people were seriously injured, with others suffering minor injuries. According to Adif, the crash happened about ten minutes after the train left Malaga at 18:40 local time (17:40 GMT). All rail services between Madrid and Andalusia were suspended following the accident. Iryo, a private rail company that operated the journey from Malaga, confirmed the derailment and said around 300 passengers were on board. King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia said they were following news of the disaster with "with great concern". "We extend our most heartfelt condolences to the relatives and loved ones of the dead, as well as our love and wishes for a swift recovery to the injured," the royal palace said on X. Salvador Jimenez, a journalist with RTVE who was on one of the trains, said some people were able to walk away without serious injuries. "I was in the first carriage. There was a moment when it felt like an earthquake and the train had indeed derailed. They called immediately to see if there were people in the health service who could help, they took hammers to break the windows and in the end they evacuated us," he added. Spain's Prime Minister, Pedro Sánchez, said the government was working with emergency services to help those affected, while Andalusian regional president Juanma Moreno expressed his concern and support for the victims and their families.

'Europe won't be blackmailed,' Danish PM says in wake of Trump Greenland threats Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen says "Europe won't be blackmailed", as she and other European leaders continue to weigh their response to US President Donald Trump's tariff threats over Greenland. Trump says he will impose new taxes on eight US allies - Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the UK - in February if they oppose his proposed takeover of the autonomous Danish territory. He insists Greenland is critical for US security and has not ruled out taking it by force - a move that has drawn widespread criticism. The countries threatened with tariffs have now issued joint statement, saying Trump's plan risks a "dangerous downward spiral". "Tariff threats undermine transatlantic relations," they said, reiterating that they "stand in full solidarity with the Kingdom of Denmark and the people of Greenland". The countries stressed they are "committed to strengthening Arctic security as a shared transatlantic interest" as members of the Nato military alliance. "We stand ready to engage in a dialogue based on the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity that we stand firmly behind," the statement reads. Separately, Frederiksen wrote on Facebook: "We want to cooperate and we are not the ones seeking conflict. And I am happy for the consistent messages from the rest of the continent: Europe will not be blackmailed." "It is all the more important that we stand firm on the fundamental values that created the European community." Meanwhile, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he had had phone calls on Sunday with Frederiksen, as well as European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Nato Secretary-General Mark Rutte, before speaking to Trump. A spokeswoman for Starmer's office said he had reiterated his position that Greenland's security was a priority for all Nato members. "He also said that applying tariffs on allies for pursuing the collective security of Nato allies is wrong," the spokeswoman added. Trump has threatened to impose a 10% tariff on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the UK, the Netherlands and Finland, which would come into force on 1 February, but could later rise to 25% - and would last until a deal was reached. "These Countries, who are playing this very dangerous game, have put a level of risk in play that is not tenable or sustainable," he wrote, adding: "This is a very dangerous situation for the Safety, Security and Survival of our Planet". The US president insists Greenland is critical for US security and has said previously that Washington would get the territory "the easy way" or "the hard way". Greenland is a sparsely populated but resource-rich and its location between North America and the Arctic makes it well placed for early warning systems in the event of missile attacks and for monitoring vessels in the region. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday told NBC News' Meet the Press that "Greenland can only be defended if it is part of the US, and it will not need to be defended if it is part of the US". "I believe that the Europeans will understand that this is best for Greenland, best for Europe and best for the United States," he said. It is still unclear how the tariffs will affect those Trump has already imposed on the UK and EU. French President Emmanuel Macron, who is working to co-ordinate the European response to the tariff threats, said he would request that the EU activate its "anti-coercion instrument" if Trump does impose them. The US president is due to speak at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Wednesday on the theme "how can we co-operate in a more contested world?" Macron, as well as the leaders of Germany and the EU, will also be attending the annual conference. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who will also be there, said his country was "concerned by the recent escalation" and that it would be "significantly increasing Arctic security — strengthening our military and investing in critical infrastructure". "Canada strongly believes that the best way to secure the Arctic is by working together within Nato," he also wrote on X. Mark Rutte, meanwhile, said he had spoken to Trump "regarding the security situation in Greenland and the Arctic". "We will continue working on this, and I look forward to seeing him in Davos later this week," he added. Public anger in both Denmark and Greenland at Trump's threats over Greenland appears undiminished. Demonstrations against Trump's takeover plans were held in Greenland's capital, Nuuk, on Saturday - before the tariff announcement - as well as in Danish cities. These rallies coincide with a visit to Copenhagen by a delegation from the US Congress. Its leader, Democratic Senator Chris Coons, described Mr Trump's rhetoric as "not constructive". The island's representative to the US has said that the last time Greenlanders were asked if they wanted to be part of the US, in January 2025, only 6% were in favour of doing so, while 85% were against. A recent poll suggests that most Americans also oppose US control of Greenland. A Reuters/Ipsos poll, which was released last Wednesday, indicated just 17% of Americans support the US taking Greenland, compared to 47% who said they opposed Trump's push to acquire the island.

Syria agrees ceasefire with Kurdish-led forces after two weeks of clashes The Syrian government has announced an immediate nationwide ceasefire with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), taking almost full control of the country, Syrian state media says. The ceasefire ends nearly two weeks of fighting and forms part of a broader 14-point agreement that will see the SDF integrated into Syria's military and state institutions. Speaking in Damascus, President Ahmed al-Sharaa said the deal would allow Syrian state institutions to reassert control over three eastern and northern governorates - al-Hasakah, Deir Ezzor and Raqqa. It follows a meeting between al-Sharaa and the US special envoy to Syria, Tom Barrack, in Damascus. Barrack praised the agreement as a step toward a "unified Syria." SDF commander Mazloum Abdi was expected to attend the meeting but was unable to travel due to weather conditions, with his visit postponed until Monday, al-Sharaa said. In a televised address, Abdi confirmed the meeting and said he would share more details about the agreement with Syria's Kurds after returning from the capital. Speaking on Kurdish television channel Ronahi, he said the deal he had agreed to with Damascus included a ceasefire to avoid a broader war, stressing that the fighting had been "imposed" on the SDF. Kurdish-led forces established their autonomous administration during Syria's civil war, almost a decade ago, with strong backing from the United States, which armed and trained the SDF as its main local partner in the fight against the Islamic State group (Isis). With US military support, the SDF drove Isis from much of northeastern Syria and went on to govern both Kurdish and Arab-majority areas. Under the agreement, signed by al-Sharaa and Abdi, Syrian authorities will take over civilian institutions, border crossings and oil and gas fields that have underpinned Kurdish self-rule. SDF military and security personnel will be integrated into Syria's defence and interior ministries following vetting, while Damascus will assume responsibility for prisons and detention camps holding tens of thousands of foreign Isis fighters and their families. Damascus also reiterated pledges to recognise Kurdish cultural and linguistic rights, including giving Kurdish official language status and marking the Kurdish new year as a national holiday - the first formal recognition of Kurdish rights since Syria's independence from France in 1946. Kuridsh media reported that Abdi said the SDF remained committed to protecting what he described as the "achievements" and "specific characteristics" of the Kurdish-led administration in northeast Syria. The agreement also reaffirms Syria's participation in the US-led coalition against Islamic State. The deal follows months of stalled negotiations after a previous integration effort failed and comes after Syrian government forces moved into Raqqa and nearby oil facilities following an SDF withdrawal earlier on Sunday. Al-Sharaa said last week it was unacceptable for a militia to control a quarter of the country and hold its main oil and commodities resources.

**Excerpt**

Israel pushes back on Trump's picks for executives on Gaza 'Board of Peace' Israel's leader Benjamin Netanyahu has convened a meeting with his top advisers to discuss US President Donald Trump's "Board of Peace" for Gaza, after Israel said it was not included in talks about the makeup of one of the board's lower bodies. The US on Saturday named the first members of the Gaza Executive Board - including Turkey's foreign minister, a Qatari official, former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Netanyahu's office has since said this was "not coordinated with Israel and runs contrary to its policy". The Board of Peace is part of Trump's 20-point plan to end the Israel-Hamas war and is expected to temporarily oversee the running of Gaza. The exact structure of the board, which will also manage Gaza's reconstruction, remains unclear and members are still being invited. The "Gaza Executive Board" will be responsible for overseeing all on-the-ground work of yet another administrative group, the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG), according to a statement released by the White House. A second body, the "founding Executive Board" - which also includes Kushner and Blair - will have a high-level focus on investment and diplomacy. So far, the only Israeli member on the Gaza Executive Board is Yakir Gabay, a businessman born in Israel and now based in Cyprus. There are no Palestinians on either senior board. Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir wrote on X: "The Gaza Strip does not need any "administrative committee" to oversee its "rehabilitation" - it needs to be cleansed of Hamas terrorists". Israel's opposition leader Yair Lapid called the announcement a "diplomatic failure for Israel." Officials from Qatar and Turkey, which have both been critical of Israel's military actions in Gaza, are confirmed members of the advisory panel. The overarching Board of Peace will be made up of world leaders, with President Trump as its chairman, the White House said. While those members have not been announced, the leaders of the UK, Hungary, Argentina, Jordan, Turkey, India, and Egypt have reportedly been invited. Governments have reacted cautiously to the invitations, with only Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, a Trump ally, confirming he has accepted the role. The White House said those chosen will work to ensure "effective governance and the delivery of best-in-class services that advance peace, stability, and prosperity for the people of Gaza". The UK was seeking more clarity on the committee, a government source told the BBC. On Saturday, Bloomberg reported that Trump was asking countries to contribute $1bn (£745m) to join the panel. Speaking to CBS news, a US official confirmed the reports, but clarified that countries could still join on a three year membership without paying anything. Canada's Mark Carney said that he agreed with Trump's plan on principle, but that the details - including financial ones - were still being worked through. Speaking to reporters in Doha on Sunday, he made clear that Canada did not have "unimpeded" aid funds to cover the costs of membership. Meanwhile, the United Nations warned on Saturday that the humanitarian crisis in Gaza is "far from over". The UN estimates around 80% of buildings in Gaza have been destroyed or damaged and families who have survived the war are now struggling with the winter weather, and a lack of food and shelter. Olga Cherevko from the UN aid coordination office said that the delivery of tonnes of aid and the fixing of roads in the months since a ceasefire came into effect were a "band aid" rather than a solution. Bitter winter weather has led to further complications, destroying buildings and making it difficult to access healthcare. Israel says that it is facilitating humanitarian assistance, and has blamed the UN for failing to distribute supplies already in Gaza. It argues any restrictions are designed to stop Hamas infiltrating and exploiting relief efforts.

Chile declares 'state of catastrophe' as deadly wildfires menace cities Chilean President Gabriel Boric has declared a state of catastrophe in two regions where deadly wildfires are raging. At least 16 people are confirmed dead in the Ñuble and Biobío regions, about 500km (300 miles) south of the capital Santiago. At least 20,000 have been evacuated. The most dangerous fire has swept through dry forests bordering the coastal city of Concepción. About 250 homes have been destroyed, disaster officials said. Local media show pictures of charred cars in the streets. Chile has experienced a series of devastating fires in recent years, worsened by long-term drought. Chile's forestry agency, Conaf, said firefighters were battling a total of 24 fires across the country on Sunday. The most threatening, it added, were in Ñuble and Biobío. "In light of the serious ongoing wildfires, I have decided to declare a state of catastrophe" in the two regions, Boric said in a post on X. "All resources are available," he added. The fires have affected 20,000 hectares (50,000 acres) in the two regions so far, local media say. The bulk of the evacuations were carried out in the cities of Penco and Lirquen, just north of Concepción, which have a combined population of 60,000. Strong winds have fanned the flames amid summer temperatures, endangering communities and hampering firefighting efforts. Much of Chile is under heat alerts, with temperatures expected to reach 38C between Santiago and Biobío in the next two days. Two years ago, forest fires killed at least 120 people in the Valparaíso region near Santiago.

Six killed in Pakistan shopping mall fire A fire at a shopping centre in the Pakistan city of Karachi has killed six people as firefighters continue to battle the blaze. Parts of the Gul Plaza, containing 1,200 stores and spanning 8,000 sq m (86,111 sq ft), have collapsed which officers said was hampering rescue efforts. One firefighter is among the dead, more than 20 people have been injured and there are fears some are still trapped inside the multi-storey mall. Local emergency services said that when helpers arrived at the site on Saturday "the fire from the ground floor had spread to the upper floors, and almost the entire building was already engulfed in flames". A senior police official told the BBC that the authorities had been unable to search the building for bodies as the fire has continued to burn. More than 30 people have been reported missing by their families, who have gathered outside what remains of the centre, waiting anxiously for news of their loved ones. Administrators for the city have set up a desk to register the names and details of the missing. Smoke was still billowing from what remains of the Gul Plaza building on Sunday morning. Much of it has collapsed and there are concerns it could collapse further. Hassan Khan, a spokesperson for Rescue 1122 in Karachi, told BBC Urdu the shopping centre contains flammable materials such as plastic foam, cloth, carpets and perfume. Summaiya Syed, Karachi's police surgeon, said six bodies had been transferred to the city's Civil Hospital as well as some of the injured. She added that the police were "invoking mass disaster protocols". Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari expressed his condolences and told the government of Sindh province, where Karachi is based, to conduct a comprehensive review of safety arrangements in commercial and residential buildings across the area.

**Excerpt**

Gangland killing at a funeral shocks idyllic French island The mourners had gathered in the small village of Vero, a half-hour drive from Ajaccio, the capital of the picture-postcard Mediterranean island of Corsica. In their midst was former nationalist leader Alain Orsoni, 71, who had flown in from exile in Nicaragua to bury his mother. Suddenly, with the ceremony under way, a single shot was fired from nearby scrubland, killing Orsoni instantly. Thirty-five people have been fatally shot on this island of 350,000 people in the past three years alone, giving it one of France's highest murder rates. Corsicans have become wearily familiar with vendettas and tit-for-tat underworld shootings, but even here, the way Orsoni was killed has stunned islanders. Yesterday, Alain Orsoni was cremated after a funeral service in Ajaccio. There was a large police presence. Close friend Jo Peraldi finds it hard to believe that a day of high emotion surrounding the funeral of Orsoni's mother could have been defiled in such a way. "A cemetery is sacred in Corsica, just like a church. Never have I witnessed seeing someone murdered while accompanying their mother to their final resting place," he told Corsican radio. Peraldi had seen his friend on the morning of the funeral. Like Orsoni, he had been an active figure in Corsican nationalism, spending 15 years in jail for organising bomb attacks against symbols of the French state. Over the years, victims of Corsica's violence have included farmers, elected officials, a lawyer, local business owners and even the president of the chamber of commerce. But for a cousin of the victim, Christian Leca, Orsoni's killing was "a tipping point in the horror". "People don't kill in cemeteries, it's intolerable," he told Le Monde newspaper. The nature of the violence has changed in recent times, says Thierry Dominici, an expert of Corsican nationalism at the University of Bordeaux who grew up on the island. "Once armed groups gave up their violent campaign for autonomy or independence, they kept their weapons and turned to organised crime instead," he told the BBC. "The French state was so focused on tackling the separatists that it turned a blind eye to their lucrative criminal activities." But he believes there is a significant difference between Corsica's organised crime and the role of the mafia in parts of southern Italy. "In Corsica the clans are not linked by family ties or rituals of lifelong loyalty, but by simple opportunism," Dominici says. Judges in Paris specialised in tackling organised crime are running the investigation into Orsoni's shooting alongside the regional prosecutor's office in Marseille. "This murder increases the mafia pressure that weighs heavily on Corsican society," says Gilles Simeoni who, as president of Corsica's regional authority, holds the island's highest elected position. "Orsoni was a major contemporary figure in Corsican nationalism both out in the open and and in the shadows." His killing has reverberated far beyond Corsica. The Orsoni family are a household name on the island and they have been long linked to nationalism as well as episodes of violence. In his younger years, Alain Orsoni spent time in jail for bomb attacks aimed at putting pressure on the French state to grant the island more autonomy. But the nationalist movement split into different groups and increasingly turned to money laundering, extortion, protection rackets, drug trafficking and violence to win lucrative state-run contracts. Orsoni's brother, Guy, was killed by a rival clan in 1983 and his son is in jail for drug trafficking and attempted murder. He narrowly escaped being killed several times and fled to Central America at the height of one of the particularly violent feuds, turning his attention instead to investing in casinos. He knew his life was in constant danger. I saw it first-hand when I spent two days with him back in 2012 for the BBC. A big football fan, he had moved back from Central America to run one of the local football clubs AC Ajaccio. Under his presidency, AC Ajaccio were even promoted to the top flight of French football, Ligue 1. Big signings were made during the club's heyday, including former Mexico goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa. When I asked Orsoni how he managed to attract star players despite having the smallest budget in Ligue 1, he cracked a smile: "Corsica is a nice place to play and I guess I am quite persuasive." At the time, he wore a bullet-proof vest and was driven around in an armored car with tinted windows. Rather than sit in a grand office with big windows overlooking the beautiful Bay of Ajaccio, the club president worked in a windowless, concrete bunker deep inside the building. When I suggested we go for a tour of the town, he categorically said no, it wasn't safe. He was renowned for his good looks and sing-song southern accent, as well as a passing resemblance to the late actor and showman Yves Montand. But his easy going smile could suddenly turn to an eerie silence. When I asked him if his reputation as the godfather of Corsica was true, he replied: "Yes, I'm the godfather, but only to my grandchildren." As we talked, surrounded by tough-looking men in leather jackets, boots and jeans, I attempted to crack a joke that fell flat. After a long, uneasy pause, Orsoni broke the silence with a chuckle and his henchmen followed suit. His eye-catching role in French football gave him a VIP pass to grounds across the country. He rubbed shoulders with mainstream dignitaries and establishment figures, including ex-President Nicolas Sarkozy, who rarely missed a home game at Paris Saint-Germain. A local prefect once told me of his distaste at the thought that Orsoni could be profiting from his new stage to show a more respectable side. "It's true I have an unusual background for some one to be a football club president and I can understand that some people are shocked," Orsoni admitted. "But I can tell you that people's impressions can change when you meet them." Not long after my visit, I talked to his lawyer, Antoine Sollacaro. Weeks later he was murdered at a petrol station in Ajaccio. In recent years, the club had fallen on hard times. Although Orsoni was still president until only a few months ago, he had moved back to Nicaragua. Why would anyone want an exiled ex-nationalist football figure dead? The list is long, according to police, and vendettas go back a long way in Corsica. Alain Bauer, a professor of criminology who has advised successive French governments on security issues, said his killing was inevitable and could herald further violence. "That Alain Orsoni was killed does not surprise me, it was just a question of when not if," Bauer told the BBC. "But the circumstances behind it are shocking. An assassination in a graveyard in Corsica is surprising and it's pretty certain there will be revenge killings. In the end the main victims are the Corsicans themselves." There are few figures more unifying in Corsica than the bishop of Ajaccio, Cardinal François Bustillo, who persuaded the late Pope Francis to visit to the island in December 2024, a few months before his death. This week he called for an end to the bloodletting. "We mustn't get used to this eye-for-an-eye, tooth-for-a-tooth violence. We cannot allow Corsica to drift towards its demons, we have to change mentalities," he said. The question is whether his plea will be heard.

Nasa's mega Moon rocket arrives at launch pad for Artemis II mission Nasa's mega rocket has been moved to the launch pad in Cape Canaveral, Florida, as the final preparations get underway for the first crewed mission to the Moon in more than 50 years. Over almost 12 hours, the 98m-tall Space Launch System was carried vertically from the Vehicle Assembly Building on the 4-mile (6.5km) journey to the pad. Now it is in position, the final tests, checks - and a dress rehearsal - will take place, before the go-ahead is given for the 10-day Artemis II mission that will see four astronauts travel around the Moon. Nasa says the earliest the rocket can blast off is 6 February, but there are also more launch windows later that month, as well as in March and April. The rocket began moving at 07:04 local time (12:04 GMT) and arrived at Launch Pad 39B at the Kennedy Space Center at 18:41 local time (23:42 GMT). The rocket was carried by a huge machine called a crawler-transporter, travelling at a top speed of 0.82 mph (1.3 km/h) as it trundled along. Live coverage captured the slow-moving spectacle. Nasa said the rocket will be prepared over the next few days for what it calls a "wet dress rehearsal" - a test for fuel operations and countdown procedures. The Artemis II crew - Nasa's Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover and Christina Koch and Canadian astronaut Jeremy Hansen - were at the Kennedy Space Center watching the rocket as it was moved. In just a few weeks, the four astronauts will be strapped into a spacecraft, perched on the top of the rocket, ready to blast off to the Moon. It will be the first crewed mission to the Moon since Apollo 17 landed on its surface in December 1972. Nasa said the mission could take its astronauts further into space that anyone has been before. Artemis II is not scheduled to land on the Moon, but will instead lay the groundwork for a future lunar landing led by the Artemis III mission. Nasa said the launch of Artemis III will take place "no earlier than" 2027. But, experts believe 2028 is the earliest possible date. Koch said it was an amazing feeling to see the rocket. "Astronauts are the calmest people on launch day. And I think... it feels that way because we're just so ready to fulfil the mission that we came here to do, that we've trained to do," she said. Hansen said he hoped the mission would inspire the world. "The Moon is something that I've taken for granted. I've looked at it my whole life, but then you just glance at it and glance away," he said. "But now I've been staring at it a lot more, and I think others will be joining us and staring at the Moon a lot more as there will be humans flying around the far side and that is just good for humanity." Before Artemis II heads to the Moon, the first two days of their mission will be spent in orbit around the Earth. "We're going to be going into an orbit almost right away that is 40,000 miles out - like a fifth of the way of the Moon," Koch told BBC News. "We will have the Earth out the window as a single ball, something none of us have seen in that perspective. "And then we're going to travel a quarter of a million miles away… we're going to do a lot of science and operations along the way." While they fly around the far side of the Moon, the crew will have three hours dedicated to lunar observation - to gaze, take images and to study its geology, which will help plan and prepare for a future landing at the Moon's south pole. A key part of the Orion spacecraft that the astronauts will be flying in was made in Bremen in Germany. The European Service Module, which sits behind the crew capsule, is the European Space Agency's contribution to the mission and has been built by Airbus. "The European Service Module is so important - we basically can't get to the Moon without it," says Sian Cleaver, a spacecraft engineer at Airbus. "It provides the propulsion that Orion needs to get us to the Moon." Its large solar arrays will generate all the electrical power for the craft, she adds. "We've also got these big tanks full of oxygen and nitrogen, which are mixed to make air, and also water, so that we can provide everything that the astronauts need in the crew module to keep them alive on their journey." Inside their cleanroom, the team is busy building more modules for future Artemis missions. Each one takes about 18 months to put together but has taken thousands of engineering hours to design. Everything on board has to work perfectly. "We've got to get those astronauts to the Moon and then back again, completely safely," says Cleaver. With the rocket now on launchpad 39B, the Artemis team is working around the clock to get it ready for lift off. The mission has already faced years of delays, and Nasa is under pressure to get the astronauts on their way as soon as possible. However, the US space agency said it would not compromise on safety. John Honeycutt, chair of the Artemis mission management team, said: "I've got one job, and it's the safe return of Reid and Victor and Christina and Jeremy. "We're going to fly when we're ready... crew safety is going to be our number one priority."

EU weighs response to Trump's tariff threat over Greenland It's not yet a full year since European leaders buckled up for President Trump's second term, and now this rollercoaster ride feels it has reached its most dangerous turn yet. The occupant on the White House is dangling the threat of economic punishment over the heads of countries that are supporting the territorial integrity of an EU member, Denmark. Leaders will hold an emergency EU summit about this in the coming days. If the European Union fights back with similar countermeasures, then it risks a full-blown trade war with the US. If it doesn't take action, will Trump conclude the bloc of 27 is weak, divided and too scared to stop him carrying out his threat of obtaining Greenland – either by buying or taking it with military force? French President Emmanuel Macron says it's time to use the EU's "trade bazooka" for the first time. This is the Anti-Coercion Instrument (ACI), which would allow Europe to hit back with counter-tariffs, restrict access to the Single Market and block applications for lucrative EU contracts. There is a great irony that this weapon was originally designed to combat any bullying interference from a hostile external power. They were thinking of China, not the US. In the here and now, some EU leaders are weary of the Macron approach. Among them is Italy's Giorgia Meloni, who has enjoyed a better-than-most rapport with Trump. She has spoken of a "problem of understanding and communication" over the recent sending of troops to Greenland by some European countries, including Denmark, but hasn't expanded on what may have been misunderstood. If the intention was to placate Trump and suggest he is absolutely right that Arctic security must be stepped up, the sight of those soldiers only seemed to provoke him into making his latest threat. Meloni's explanation of something lost in translation opens the door to a more diplomatic approach to tackling this precarious EU-US crisis. Sunday's emergency meeting in Brussels of EU ambassadors was a discreet affair, unlike the routine top level summits where the traffic stops, roads are closed and leaders stream towards the cameras to deliver their thoughts. It's not clear who will make the next move and whether Trump will take some heat out of his latest threat or in fact double down on it. EU action on something so sensitive is unlikely to be swift and unanimous. Europe has tried to placate President Trump in his second term as best they can. Some have called it shrewd, others sycophantic. But now, there's a distinct feeling he's not just pulling up the Transatlantic diplomatic drawbridge, but is threatening to blow it up altogether.

Watch: Timelapse shows Nasa rocket's 12-hour journey to launch pad The gigantic Space Launch System (SLS) Moon rocket and Orion Space Capsule was moved from Nasa's Kennedy Space Center in Florida to a launch pad around four miles (6.4km) away. The rocket was carefully transported at a top speed of 0.82 mph (1.3 km/h), with the journey taking almost 12 hours on Saturday. Part of the Artemis II mission, the rocket is not set to launch into space until 6 February at the earliest. The 10-day mission could take its four astronauts further into space than anyone has been before. It aims to set the stage for an eventual human landing on the surface of the Moon for the first time since 1972.
