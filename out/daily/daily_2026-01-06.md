Iran anti-government protests spread to majority of provinces, videos show Protests have broken out in at least 17 of Iran's 31 provinces, presenting the largest challenge to the country's clerical establishment since 2022, a BBC Verify and BBC Persian analysis has found. The BBC's analysis of protests includes only those for which we have verified video footage - the true number is almost certainly far higher. There are reports of protests in a further 11 provinces. The wave of protests has spread rapidly across Iran since 28 December, when anger initially broke out in the capital Tehran following a fresh and sharp devaluation of the country's currency against the dollar and other major foreign currencies. Verified footage from the last 10 days shows evidence of anti-government demonstrations and gatherings in more than 40 towns and cities across the country, including in several regions previously perceived as being highly loyal to the state. More than 100 videos which which we geolocated and checked for publication date paint a picture of the scale of the unrest, with people taking to the streets in many major cities in Iran and presenting the largest challenge to the state since the Women, Life and Freedom protests in 2022. Footage has also shown protests in Qom in central Iran and Mashhad in the north-east, both of which have traditionally hosted populations extremely loyal to the Islamic Republic. Prof Sina Azodi, Director of Middle East Studies Program at George Washington University, said that unrest in those cities was "very telling" and amounted to evidence that the government's "base of support is also suffering under the economic hardship". Authorities have traditionally used violence to crush unrest. During the 2022 protests - sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young woman who had been detained in Tehran for wearing "improper hijab" - more than 550 people were allegedly killed by security forces, according to human rights groups. While the latest response by police and security forces initially appeared to be more restrained, verified footage has shown officers ramping up the use of force since Saturday. This change in approach coincided with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's first public reaction to the protests on that day, in which he said that "rioters must be put in their place". Since the supreme leader's remarks, Iran's judiciary chief, Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei, said authorities would "listen to protesters and critics who legitimately and rightly have concerns about their livelihood and social and economic welfare". But he added that they would "deal firmly with those who seek to exploit the situation, incite riots, and undermine the security of the country and the people". The powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) has also issued warnings to protesters in Lorestan province that they will no longer tolerate street gatherings. BBC Persian has so far confirmed the identities of at least 11 people reported dead since 28 December using a combination of verified funeral videos and interviews with family members and friends. Foreign-based human rights group HRANA says at least 35 people have so far been killed in the unrest, including two affiliated with security forces. One of the most violent crackdowns happened in Malekshahi, a small town in the western province of Ilam, on Saturday. Verified footage showed a small demonstration taking place at Commandery Boulevard, where the officers of several state institutions are located, before gunfire appeared to break out. Human rights groups said four people were killed in the incident, with the semi-official Mehr and Tasnim news agencies putting the figure at three dead. Later footage showed a number of people being transported to hospital. It was unclear from the footage what condition those seen in the footage were in. Multiple verified videos filmed in the nearby Ilam city show security forces firing shots towards Imam Khomeini Hospital in the centre of the city later on Saturday. Iran's president has ordered an investigation into the incident. Experts warned that the security forces heavy-handed response could exacerbate the challenges facing the government. "Escalating repression is likely to deepen popular resentment toward the political system while risking fatigue and demoralisation within the police and security forces - who, at some point, may cease to comply with orders," Peyman Jafari, assistant professor of international relations at the US-based College of William and Mary, told BBC Verify. Iran security force member killed during protests, officials say - Iran protests enter ninth day as Trump renews intervention threat - Protests and US warnings shake Iran at its weakest point in years - While most of the footage featuring violence seen by the BBC was carried out by security forces, a few clips have also shown demonstrators attacking government forces. In Qom, one video showed officers riding motorbikes being pelted with rocks as they sped past a small gathering. Another dramatic clip showed a security officer on a motorbike set ablaze by a demonstrator wielding an improvised flamethrower after security forces violently detained and beat up a protester. It is unclear what happened to the officer, as the footage cut off, while other officers gave chase to the demonstrator who fled on foot. And in the western city of Azna, demonstrators appeared to start a fire outside a police station after security forces opened fire on protesters earlier. BBC Persian has identified at least three demonstrators killed in Azna by verifying footage of funerals and speaking to family members. The demonstrations initially began as a backlash against what they say is the government's mismanagement of the country's struggling economy, which has increasingly floundered under the weight of international sanctions. Officials have also been accused of widespread corruption. But in recent days the demonstrations have taken an anti-state tone, with protesters in numerous locations chanting slogans against Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the clerical establishment that has been ruling the country since the 1979 Islamic revolution. Verified videos have also shown chants in support of Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the Shah of Iran, and the pre-1979 revolution Pahlavi dynasty. At the University of Tehran, some protesters chanted "death to the dictator" - a reference to Khamenei - as dozens of demonstrators flooded through the institution's main gate on 30 December. And in the city of Iranshahr in the coastal Sistan and Baluchestan province, protesters set fire to a statue of Khamenei and the leader of the 1979 revolution, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Holly Dagres, senior fellow at the Washington Institute and curator of the Iranist newsletter, said the Tehran government had learned few lessons from the 2022 protests which raged across Iran for more than four months. "While the catalysts differ… the problems remain the same: systemic mismanagement, corruption, and repression," she said. "The countless anti-regime chants make clear that many Iranians are calling for the ouster of the Islamic Republic." Despite the extent of the demonstrations, most of the experts who spoke to the BBC said they do not yet amount to an existential threat to the state. "Security forces are loyal - there are no defections at this point and law enforcement forces are carrying out the orders," Azodi said. "Furthermore, while the protests are widespread we are not seeing a clear strategy [or] attempt by the protesters to bring down the Islamic Republic."

### 2. [Trump claims US oil firms could be 'up and running' in Venezuela within 18 months](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4grxzxjjd8o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

Trump claims US oil firms could be 'up and running' in Venezuela within 18 months President Donald Trump says the US oil industry could be "up and running" with increased operations in Venezuela within 18 months, after a surprise military operation removed President Nicolás Maduro from power. Trump told NBC News that "a tremendous amount of money will have to be spent, and the oil companies will spend it, and the oil companies will spend it, and then they'll get reimbursed by us or through revenue". Representatives from major US petroleum companies planned to meet the Trump administration later this week, BBC's partner CBS News reported. Analysts previously told the BBC it could take tens of billions of dollars, and potentially a decade, to restore Venezuela's former output. Trump's remarks came days after he said the US would "run" Venezuela after the ousting of Maduro - who has now been brought to the US to face criminal charges. Speaking to NBC about his 18-month timeframe, Trump speculated that oil production could ramp up "in less time than that, but it'll be a lot of money". He has been explicit about his ambitions for American petroleum companies to scale up their operations in the country. "Having a Venezuela that's an oil producer is good for the United States because it keeps the price of oil down," Trump added. The analysts who previously spoke to the BBC were sceptical that Trump's plans would have a major impact on the global supply - and therefore price - of oil. They suggested that firms would look for reassurance that a stable government was in place, and even when they did invest, their projects would not deliver for years. Trump has claimed in recent days that American oil companies can fix Venezuela's oil infrastructure. The country has an estimated 303bn barrels, the world's largest proven reserve - but its oil production has been in decline since the early 2000s. The Trump administration sees significant potential for its own energy prospects in Venezuela's reserves. Increasing the country's production of oil would be expensive for US firms. Additionally, Venezuelan oil is heavy and more difficult to refine. There is only one US firm, Chevron, currently working in the country. Asked for comment about Trump's plans for US oil production in Venezuela, Chevron spokesman Bill Turenne said the company "remains focused on the safety and wellbeing of our employees, as well as the integrity of our assets". "We continue to operate in full compliance with all relevant laws and regulations," Turenne added. Other major US energy companies Exxon and ConocoPhillips did not immediately respond to requests for comment. While justifying the seizure of Maduro from Caracas, Trump also claimed that Venezuela "unilaterally seized and stole American oil". Vice President JD Vance echoed those claims on X after Maduro was taken, writing that "Venezuela expropriated American oil property and until recently used that stolen property to get rich and fund their narcoterrorist activities". The reality is more complex. US oil companies have a long history in Venezuela, extracting oil under licence agreements. Venezuela nationalised its oil industry in 1976 and in 2007, President Hugo Chavez exerted more state control over the remaining foreign-owned assets of US oil firms operating in the country. In 2019, a World Bank tribunal ordered Venezuela to pay $8.7 billion to ConocoPhillips in compensation for this 2007 move. That sum has not been paid by Venezuela, so at least one US oil company has outstanding compensation which is owed to it. But BBC Verify's Ben Chu said the claim Venezuela has "stolen" American oil is too simplistic, as experts said the oil itself was never actually owned by anyone except Venezuela.

**Excerpt**

Macron hosts Ukraine and allies to try to cement security guarantees French President Emmanuel Macron is hosting Ukraine's leader Volodymyr Zelensky and other key allies of the country as efforts intensify to agree security guarantees for Kyiv in the event of a ceasefire with Russia. Heads of state and top officials from more than 30 countries - part of the so-called Coalition of the Willing - are taking part, including US mediators in peace talks Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump's son-in-law. Zelensky met Trump recently and said his plan to end the war with Russia was 90% agreed. However, the proposals have yet to be presented to Russia, whose response so far has been far from encouraging. The outstanding 10% of the agreement that's yet to be decided concerns territorial concessions Kyiv is being asked to agree to. Moscow currently controls about 75% of the Donetsk region, and some 99% of the neighbouring Luhansk. The two regions form the industrial region of Donbas. Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and has been making slow progress on the ground recently and, therefore, is unwilling to compromise on its aim to seize full control of Donbas. Russia has also consistently opposed any idea of a temporary ceasefire and has intensified its attacks in Ukraine, particularly aimed at paralysing its power supplies in the middle of a harsh winter. Ukraine has also hit back with drones - the latest target being an oil depot in the Lipetsk region of western Russia. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte are among the participants at the Paris meeting. Leaders are expected to seek agreement on details that include a multi-national force to reassure Ukraine after a peace deal, what security guarantees to offer Ukraine in the event of a renewed Russian attack - as well as helping Ukraine's armed forces and its economy. For months, the so-called "backstop" has been on the agenda - the desire among Ukraine's European allies to secure a pledge from the US that it will be involved in responding to Russia should it violate the terms of a peace deal. Following talks between Zelensky and Trump in Florida last month, the Ukrainian leader said Washington had offered security guarantees for 15 years - but a time frame for their implementation is not yet clear. The talks in Paris are being overshadowed by the aftermath of the US's military action in Venezuela, where elite troops went in to seize the country's President Nicolás Maduro and take him to face drugs and weapons charges in New York. Following the raid, Trump said the US would "run" Venezuela for an unspecified period of time. He also said the US was returning to last century's policy of US supremacy in its sphere of influence in the Western hemisphere. Looming larger over the Paris talks is Trump's subsequent insistence that the US wants to annex Greenland - the semi-autonomous territory that is part of Denmark, a Nato ally. The repeated threat prompted Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen to say any such move from the US would be the end of the trans-Atlantic alliance. European leaders have been reluctant to criticise Trump's intervention in Venezuela and its perceived implications for the world order. But many, including Starmer and Macron, have sided with Denmark over Greenland. As host of the talks, Macron will be keen not to have the issue derail the focus on Ukraine.

European allies back Denmark over Trump's threat to annex Greenland Six European allies have rallied to support Denmark following renewed insistence by the US that it must have control over Greenland. "Greenland belongs to its people, and only Denmark and Greenland can decide on matters concerning their relations," the leaders of the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, and Denmark said in a joint statement. On Sunday, Donald Trump said the US "needed" Greenland - a semi-autonomous region of fellow Nato member Denmark - for security reasons. He has refused to rule out the use of force to take control of the territory, and Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen warned on Monday that an attack by the US would spell the end of Nato. Nato is a trans-Atlantic military group where allies are expected to go to each other's aid in case of external attacks. The issue of Greenland's future resurfaced in the wake of the US military intervention in Venezuela, during which elite troops went in to seize the country's President Nicolás Maduro and take him to face drugs and weapons charges in New York. Following the raid, Trump said the US would "run" Venezuela for an unspecified period of time. He also said the US was returning to an 1823 policy of US supremacy in its sphere of influence in the Western hemisphere - and he warned a number of countries the US could turn its attention to them. The US military raid in Venezuela has reignited fears that the US may consider using force to secure control of Greenland. A day after the raid, Katie Miller - the wife of one of Trump's senior aides - posted on social media a map of Greenland in the colours of the American flag, alongside the word "SOON". On Monday, her husband Stephen Miller said it was "the formal position of the US government that Greenland should be part of the US". In an interview with CNN, he also said the US "is the power of Nato. For the US to secure the Arctic region, to protect and defend Nato and Nato interests, obviously Greenland should be part of the US." Asked repeatedly whether the US would rule out using force to annex it, Miller responded: "Nobody's going to fight the US over the future of Greenland." Stressing they were as keen as the US in Arctic security, the seven European signatories of Tuesday's joint statement said this must be achieved by Nato allies, including the US "collectively" - whilst "upholding the principles of the UN Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders". Trump has claimed that making Greenland part of the US would serve American security interests due to its strategic location and its abundance of minerals critical to high-tech sectors. The Trump administration's recent move to appoint a special envoy to Greenland prompted anger in Denmark. Greenland, which has a population of 57,000 people, has had extensive self-government since 1979, though defence and foreign policy remain in Danish hands. While most Greenlanders favour eventual independence from Denmark, opinion polls show overwhelming opposition to becoming part of the US.

**Excerpt**

Swiss ski bar not inspected for five years before deadly fire, mayor says The Swiss bar that was the scene of a fire which killed 40 people and injured 116 had not undergone safety checks for five years, authorities have said. The mayor of Crans-Montana, Nicolas Feraud, told a Tuesday news conference that he could not explain why Le Constellation bar had not been checked in so long, but that the council was "profoundly sorry". The venues should have been checked annually. "We regret that - we owe it to the families and we will accept the responsibility," he said. He added that sparklers - which are believed to have caused the fire when they were raised too close to the ceiling - will be banned in local venues. Local authorities will now bring in an external contractor to inspect and audit all 128 venues in the area. Feraud conceded there was a team of five people inspecting more than 10,000 buildings in Crans-Montana and could not explain why the bar had not been inspected since 2019. Taking repeated questions on why the bar had not been checked in so long, Feraud said: "I have no answer for you today." "We're profoundly sorry about that and I know how hard that will be for the families." "I'm not resigning, no, and I don't want to," he later added. Feraud said it would be "down to the judges" to decide whether members of the local authority would be included in a criminal investigation that has been opened by Swiss prosecutors. When the fire occurred on New Year's Day, the bar seemed to have many more people in it than legally permitted, which Feraud said was the responsibility of the managers of Le Constellation to regulate. Swiss prosecutors have placed the two bar managers under criminal investigation, which local media have named as French couple, Jacques and Jessica Moretti. They are both suspected of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence, the prosecutors' office in Valais said. Feraud said the use of sound-proofing material on the ceiling of the bar and allowing sparklers in the venue was extremely negligent. Questioned on why authorities had not acted on pictures of sparklers close to the bar's ceiling that were widely available on social media and used as promotion for Le Constellation before the fire, Feraud said it was likely no-one in the council saw the images.

Self-proclaimed hypnotherapist on trial in France for drugging and raping women Warning: This story contains descriptions of sexual abuse. A man is on trial in southern France accused of drugging and sexually abusing women, as well as filming some of the assaults. Dance teacher and self-taught hypnotherapist Cyril Zattara is charged with raping 14 women over a decade, as well as allegedly secretly filming around 20 other women. Zattara, who has been held in detention awaiting trial since 2021, has admitted 10 rape charges. The trial is being held behind closed doors in the city of Aix-en-Provence at the request of one of the alleged victims, and is due to last at least two weeks. Others had sought open proceedings, saying they wanted their voices to be heard by as many people as possible. Zattara would allegedly slip sleeping pills into women's drinks before sexually assaulting them, a police investigation found. He allegedly often targeted women he was friends with or in intimate relationships with. Investigators found photos and videos on Zattara's computer that showed the alleged victims in a lethargic state during sex. One woman, who filed a complaint against the defendant in 2019 after attending one of his hypnosis sessions, said she had drunk some wine he had offered her and later woke up, recalling in fragments that she had been raped by Zattara and that she had been vomiting. His DNA was found under her fingernails and on her underwear, while toxicology results showed powerful sleep-inducing drugs in her system. The Zattara trial follows the high-profile case of Dominique Pelicot, who was jailed for 20 years after drugging and raping his ex-wife Gisèle and inviting dozens of strangers to also abuse her over nearly a decade.

Israel's foreign minister on historic visit to Somaliland Israel's foreign minister has arrived in the breakaway state of Somaliland, marking the first official visit since Israel controversially recognised Somaliland as an independent country. Gideon Saar landed in capital city Hargeisa on Tuesday and met with Somaliland President Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi, government sources there told the BBC. Last month Israel became the first country in the world to recognise Somaliland, which declared independence from Somalia more than 30 years ago. Somaliland's president called Israel's move "a historic moment", but Somalia furiously rejected the development as an attack on its sovereignty. The Israeli foreign ministry has not publicly commented on Saar's trip, but a diplomatic source in Somaliland told the BBC that the visit is intended to advance political and strategic partnerships. Somaliland declared independence from Somalia in 1991, after the overthrow of Somali military dictator Siad Barre. However, the region has remained largely unrecognised on the global stage and Somalia considers Somaliland to be an integral part of its territory. Israel's recognition of Somaliland last month came as a surprise, with Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu citing Somaliland's "right to self-determination". This move sparked international condemnation and prompted an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council. China, Turkey and the African Union were among those criticising Israel's step, while the European Union said Somalia's sovereignty should be respected. The US defended Israel, accusing its critics of double standards. In a statement following Israel's announcement, Saar said: "Somaliland was not created this past weekend. It has existed as a functioning state for more than 34 years. "The attacks on Israel's recognition of Somaliland are hypocritical. Only Israel will decide who to recognise and with who to maintain diplomatic relations." President Abdullahi has said Somaliland would join the Abraham Accords, a deal brokered by the Trump administration in 2020, which saw a number of Arab states establish ties with Israel. Israel has pledged to cooperate with Somaliland in agriculture, health, technology and the economy. Analysts say there are strategic reasons for Israel's declaration. "Israel requires allies in the Red Sea region for many strategic reasons, among them the possibility of a future campaign against the Houthis," Israeli think tank the Institute for National Security Studies said, referring to Yemen's Iran-backed rebels, in a paper last month.

Nestle issues global recall of some baby formula products over toxin fears Nestle has issued a global recall of some baby formula products over concerns they contain a toxin which can cause food poisoning. The food and drink giant said specific batches of its SMA infant formula and follow-on formula were not safe to be fed to babies. The batches were sold across the world, Nestle said, and they potentially contain cereulide, which can trigger nausea and vomiting when consumed. The company said there had been no confirmed reports of illness associated with the products, but was recalling them "out of an abundance of caution". "The safety and wellbeing of babies is our absolute priority," Nestle said. "We sincerely apologise for any concern or inconvenience caused to parents, caregivers, and customers." The company confirmed to the BBC that the recall was global. Affected products were sold in several European countries, including France, Germany, Austria, Denmark, Italy and Sweden. It stressed that all other Nestle products and batches of the same products that have not been recalled are safe to consume. Nestle promised refunds for customers and said the problem was caused by an ingredient provided by one of its suppliers. Nestle France said it was carrying out a "preventive and voluntary recall" of certain batches of its Guigoz and Nidal infant formulas. In Germany, the formula products are called Beba and Alfamino. Customers are advised to look for the corresponding code on the base of the tin or box for powdered formulas or the base of the outer box and on the side or top of the container for ready-to-feed formulas. Cereulide is a toxin produced by some strains of the Bacillus cereus bacteria that can cause food poisoning symptoms, which can be quick to develop and include vomiting and stomach cramps. It is unlikely to be deactivated or destroyed by cooking, using boiling water or when making the infant milk, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) warned. The FSA's head of incidents, Jane Rawling, said parents, guardians and caregivers should not feed infants or young children the affected products. She added: "I want to reassure parents, guardians and caregivers that we are taking urgent action, helping to ensure all of the affected product is removed from sale as a precaution. "If you have fed this product to a baby and have any concerns about potential health impact, you should seek advice from healthcare professionals by contacting your GP or calling NHS 111."

**Excerpt**

Nvidia unveils self-driving car tech as it seeks to power more products with AI Nvidia has unveiled a new tech platform for self-driving cars as the world's leading chip-maker seeks more physical products to embed AI into. Speaking at the annual CES technology conference in Las Vegas, boss Jensen Huan said the system - called Alpamayo - would bring "reasoning" to autonomous vehicles. That would allow cars to "think through rare scenarios, drive safely in complex environments, and explain their driving decisions," Huang claimed. He said Nvidia was working with Mercedes to produce a driverless car powered by the tech, which would be released in the US in the coming months before being rolled out in Europe and Asia. Nvidia's chips have helped power the AI revolution, though so far attention has mostly been focussed on the software it powers, such as ChatGPT. However, leading tech firms are now increasingly looking for hardware - meaning physical products such as cars - that AI could be used in. Physical AI's 'ChatGPT moment' Wearing his trademark black leather jacket, Huang told an audience of hundreds that the project has taught Nvidia "an enormous amount" about how to help partners build robotic systems. "The ChatGPT moment for physical AI is almost here," Huang said. "NVIDIA's pivot toward AI at scale and AI systems as differentiators will help keep it way ahead of rivals," said Paolo Pescatore, analyst at PP Foresight, from Las Vegas. "Alpamayo represents a profound shift for NVIDIA, moving from being primarily a compute to a platform provider for physical AI ecosystems." Shares of the AI chip designer rose slightly in after-hours trading following Huang's presentation. It featured a video demonstration of the AI-powered Mercedes-Benz driving through San Francisco while a passenger, sat behind the steering wheel, kept their hands in their lap. "It drives so naturally because it learned directly from human demonstrators," Huang said, "but in every single scenario... it tells you what it's going to do, and it reasons about what it's about to do." Alpamayo is an open-source AI model, with the underlying code now available on machine learning platform Hugging Face, where autonomous vehicle researchers can access it for free and retrain the model, Huang said. "Our vision is that someday, every single car, every single truck, will be autonomous," he told the audience. The project could pose a threat to companies like Elon Musk's Tesla, which offers driver assistance software called Autopilot. "Well that's just exactly what Tesla is doing," Musk posted on social media following the Alpamayo announcement. "What they will find is that it's easy to get to 99% and then super hard to solve the long tail of the distribution." Like Tesla, Nvidia also has plans to launch a robotaxi service by next year in collaboration with a partner, but has declined to name the partner or say where it will be. Nvidia is the world's most valuable publicly traded company, with a market cap of more than $4.5tn (£3.3tn). It became the first company to reach $5tn in October, but has lost value over concerns about whether demand AI is overhyped. The company also revealed that its Rubin AI chips are currently being manufactured and are due for release later this year. The highly-anticipated hardware can compute using less energy than Nvidia's current line of AI chips, and could drive down the cost of developing the technology.

At least 22 Ethiopian migrants killed in 'horrific' road crash At least 22 migrants have been killed and 65 others injured after a lorry they were travelling in overturned in Ethiopia's north-eastern Afar region, authorities say. About 85 Ethiopian migrants were travelling along the eastern migration route when the lorry overturned in the town of Semera on Tuesday morning, a senior Afar official Mohammed Ali Biedo said in a statement. Their final destination was unclear but the route typically runs from Ethiopia through Djibouti, across the Red Sea to Yemen, and onward to Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern countries. Yemen is a major pathway for migrants from the Horn of Africa travelling to Gulf states in search of work. Biedo said that 30 of the injured are in a critical condition. "The accident occurred when a lorry transporting migrants, misled by illegal brokers and unaware of the dangers of their journey, overturned," Biedo said in the statement. The Afar regional government said it was "doing all the necessary life saving operations" on the injured migrants following the "horrific" accident. It cautioned Ethiopians, particularly the youth, against the dangers of human trafficking driven by false promises. "We will ensure that the law enforcement work will continue with the concerned authorities to prevent such tragic events from repeating," the regional government added. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) describes the journey from the Horn of Africa - composed of Somalia, Djibouti, Ethiopia and Eritrea - to Yemen as "one of the busiest and most perilous mixed migration routes". Despite the risks, more than 60,000 migrants arrived in Yemen in 2024 alone, many ultimately bound for Saudi Arabia, according to IOM.

Tomorrowland to hold its first ever Asia festival in Thailand Tomorrowland, the hugely popular European electronic dance music or EDM festival, will stage its first-ever full-fledged Asia edition in Thailand this December. Thailand was chosen for its "growing influence on the global stage of music, innovation, and experience-driven tourism", Tomorrowland said on Tuesday. Founded 20 years ago by Belgian brothers Manu and Michiel Beers, Tomorrowland has become one of the world's most iconic celebrations of EDM. Its annual Belgian edition often features ambitious, creative stages and wild parties that draw music lovers from across the world. Organisers are expecting more than 50,000 attendees each day in the Thai beach town Pattaya from 11 to 13 December. Pre-registration for tickets begins on 8 January. A "full madness pass" covering all three days of the festival will cost 12,500 baht ($400; £300) while a single-day pass is going at 5,100 baht. More details on the festival's theme and line-up will follow soon, organisers said. Although the Tomorrowland group has held events in some Asian cities, this is the first time it will be holding an entire festival in the continent, and one that is similar to the scale of what it does in Belgium. Thailand finalised an agreement with Tomorrowland to host the event for five years and expects it to generate 21bn baht ($673m; £497m) over the period, Thai media reported. "Expanding Tomorrowland to a new continent is a milestone we approach with great respect and excitement... This is the beginning of a long-term story," said Tomorrowland's chief executive officer Bruno Vanwelsenaers. In recent years, Thailand has become a strong contender in the live music scene. Last year, it played host to international music festivals like Electric Daisy Carnival and Creamfields. Bangkok was also a stop on K-pop band Blackpink's world tour last October. And the country's homegrown music and arts festival Wonderfruit is emerging as a hot destination on the festival circuit, drawing tens of thousands of people each year.

Indian gang rape survivor back home after a week in hospital The survivor of a gang rape in the northern Indian state of Haryana has been discharged from hospital a week after her horrific assault, a police official told the BBC. The 26-year-old mother-of-two was taken to hospital in Faridabad city on the morning of 30 December with serious head and facial injuries and several fractures. Her sister said she was out visiting a friend and was waiting for transport just after midnight when two men in an ambulance offered her a lift. They drove her to a deserted place where they raped her and then threw her out of the speeding vehicle. A police spokesman said they had acted swiftly and arrested the two men and seized the vehicle. The woman was discharged by the hospital on Monday night following treatment and surgeries. Senior police official Mukesh Kumar told the BBC that they have approached the court to allow her to visit the prison for an "identification parade". Once the court order comes, she would be asked to pick out the two suspects from a crowd of men. The police said the crime took place on the intervening night of 29th and 30th December. "The incident took place between 12.30 and 02:00. One stood outside the van and kept an eye on the surroundings while the other raped the woman inside the van," Yashpal Yadav, public relations officer of Faridabad police, said. Police had questioned the suspects, who were later produced in court and sent to prison, he added. A doctor at the hospital where the survivor was treated had said that the woman was brought in "at around 05:30 on 30 December... she had a lot of injuries". Shalini Chopra, a social worker and an opposition politician, who spoke to the survivor after she was discharged from the hospital told the BBC that the woman was "better but still in pain". The case has provoked anger and outrage in India and drawn comparisons with the horrific gang-rape of a 23-year-old woman on a bus in Delhi in December 2012. Delhi Nirbhaya rape death penalty: What do hangings mean for India's women? - Hyderabad case: Why Indians are celebrating the killings - Was Delhi gang rape India's #Metoo moment? - That crime had made global headlines, led to huge protests in Delhi and several other cities and forced the government to introduce tough new anti-rape laws that included the death penalty for the most gruesome attacks. Four men convicted of the gang-rape and murder were hanged in 2020. One of the rapists died in prison while a juvenile was freed after spending time in a reform centre. But despite the heightened scrutiny of sexual crimes since then, tens of thousands of rapes and sexual assaults continue to be reported every year. According to latest police records, 29,670 rapes and 2,796 attempted rapes were reported in 2023. In addition, police also recorded 849 cases of child rapes and 94 cases of attempted rapes of children.

Published - Aryna Sabalenka defended her 'Battle of the Sexes' match against Nick Kyrgios after she opened her 2026 season with a 47-minute victory against Cristina Bucsa. Women's world number one Sabalenka lost 6-3 6-3 to Kyrgios in a much-publicised exhibition match in Dubai last month. Belarusian Sabalenka, a four-time major winner, said it helped her fitness after she swept aside Spain's Bucsa, ranked 28th in the world, 6-0 6-1 in the second round of the Brisbane International. "When you play against a guy, the intensity is completely different," Sabalenka said. "Especially when there is Nick, who is drop-shotting every other shot, you move a lot, so there was a great fitness for me." The match was widely criticised, with Wimbledon champion Iga Swiatek saying this week that it did not have "anything to do with social change", following the original 'Battle of the Sexes' between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs in 1973. But Sabalenka said the match "brought so many eyes on tennis". "It wasn't about proving something to anyone. It was able to show that tennis can be really huge," she said. "That exhibition, it was fun. It was a great challenge." Sabalenka, who received a first-round bye in Brisbane, will face Romania's Sorana Cirstea in round three.

**Excerpt**

Selfies and smiles: South Korea seeks 'new phase' in ties with China South Korea's President Lee Jae Myung has called for a "new phase" in ties with China as he met its leader Xi Jinping in Beijing on Monday. Regional security and lifting Beijing's unofficial ban on Korean pop culture is high on Lee's agenda, as he continues his four-day trip in China. He is set to meet China's Premier Li Qiang and the chairman of parliament, Zhao Leji on Tuesday. It marks the first visit by a South Korean leader since 2019. Bilateral ties had soured under Lee's predecessor, impeached ex-president Yoon Suk Yeol, who was very critical of China. Xi, meanwhile, has appeared keen to shore up ties with South Korea amid a diplomatic row between China and Japan. South Korea is a US security ally - like Japan - but also relies on China for trade. Experts say Lee is expected to keep walking a diplomatic tightrope between Beijing and Tokyo. The visit marks the second time the two leaders have met since November when Xi visited South Korea for a regional economic summit. On Monday Lee stated that the visit was "a crucial opportunity" for the "full-scale restoration of South Korea-China relations", reported South Korean newspaper Chosun. "We want to usher in a new phase in the development of South Korea-China relations." Government officials and companies from both countries signed a series of cooperation agreements on technology, trade and environment. Lee also took selfies with Xi, using a Xiaomi phone that the Chinese president had gifted him last year. "The image quality is certainly good, right?" Lee posted on X along with the photos. Xi noted that the "international situation is becoming more turbulent and complex". The meeting followed the US's capture of Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro over the weekend. Xi urged Lee to "firmly stand on the right side of history and make correct strategic choices", China's official Xinhua news agency reported. He also brought up the two countries' shared history of resisting Japan militarism, saying that China and South Korea should now "work hand in hand to safeguard the outcomes of the victory of World War Two and uphold peace and stability in Northeast Asia". Xi's eagerness to meet Lee signals the pressure he faces in finding a regional ally, Park Seung-chan, professor of China studies at Yongin University told the BBC. "China may beat around the bush but its demand is clear: side with China and denounce Japan." During his four-day trip to China, Lee is expected to hold a memorial service in Shanghai for activists who fought for Korea's independence from Japan. But while South Korea is "still showing all its deference towards China", it wants to "strengthen its relationships with both Japan and China", Mr Park said. Lee is reportedly planning to visit Japan later this month to meet Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi. The Japanese leader has come under fire from Beijing for suggesting in parliament that Tokyo could respond with its own self-defence forces in case of a Chinese attack on Taiwan, the self-governed island that China claims as its territory. Security on the Korean Peninsula has also been part of the discussions. Lee has sought to engage North Korea diplomatically, but there has been little progress so far. He needs Chinese cooperation in pressuring the North's Kim Jong Un to give up his nuclear weapons. Beijing is one of Pyongyang's biggest supporters, economically and diplomatically. Lee vowed on Monday to work with China on "viable alternatives for peace on the Korean Peninsula". On Sunday Seoul's military said Pyongyang fired ballistic missiles off its east coast. And on Monday the North's state news agency said the country test-fired hypersonic missiles to assess deterrence capabilities following recent developments, in an apparent reference to the US's seizure of Maduro. It remains unclear how much Lee will be able to push China on North Korea. In September, Xi had pledged to strengthen Beijing's "traditional friendship" with Pyongyang. And Seoul and Beijing are not natural allies. US troops have been stationed in South Korea for decades in case of an attack from the North, and last year the two sides agreed to cooperate on building nuclear-powered submarines. The announcement drew warnings from China. Lee has also sought to put a stop to China's build-up of maritime structures in waters between the two countries. Beijing says the structures are fish-farming equipment, but they have sparked security concerns in Seoul. The two leaders agreed on Monday to continue "constructive" dialogue on the matter, South Korea's presidential spokesperson said. Another item high on Lee's agenda is China's unofficial restrictions on South Korean music and dramas that have been in place for a decade. K-pop and K-dramas are either unavailable or difficult to access on Chinese media platforms. While China has never acknowledged a ban on Korean artists, it's believed to be a protest against South Korea's decision to deploy a US anti-missile system in 2016, which China sees as a threat to its military operations in the region. China is a massive market for Korean entertainment, which is already a huge global success. At a Korea-China business forum on Sunday, Lee encouraged deeper bilateral collaboration in beauty products, food and cultural content including movies and music. A South Korean presidential spokesperson said on Monday that the two leaders agreed to discuss the gradual expansion of cultural exchanges - without specifying concrete commitments on K-dramas or K-pop. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson similarly told reporters on Tuesday that both sides have agreed to "carry out orderly, healthy, and beneficial cultural exchanges". Speaking before Korean residents in Beijing on Sunday, Lee said his visit would "serve as a new starting point to fill in the gaps in Korea-China relations, restore them to normal and upgrade them to a new level".
