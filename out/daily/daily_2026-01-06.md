**Excerpt**

Cuba defiant as it braces for post-Maduro era After Venezuela, there is no nation in the Americas more affected by the events in Caracas than Cuba. The two nations have shared a political vision of state-led socialism since a fresh-faced Venezuelan presidential candidate, Hugo Chávez, met the aged leader of the Cuban Revolution, Fidel Castro, on the tarmac at Havana airport in 1999. For years, their mutual ties only deepened, as Venezuelan crude oil flowed to the communist-run island in exchange for Cuban doctors and medics travelling in the other direction. After the deaths of the two men, it was Nicolás Maduro - trained and instructed in Cuba - who became Chávez's handpicked successor, chosen partly because he was acceptable to the Castro brothers. He represented continuity for the Cuban revolution as much as the Venezuelan one. Now he, too, is gone from the seat of power in Caracas, forcibly removed by the US's elite Delta Force team. The prospects for Cuba in his absence are bleak. For now, the Cuban government has robustly denounced the attack as illegal and declared two days of national mourning for 32 Cuban nationals killed in the US military operation. Their deaths revealed a key fact long-known about Cuban influence over the Venezuelan presidency and military: Maduro's security detail was almost entirely made up of Cuban bodyguards. Cuban nationals are in place in numerous positions in Venezuela's intelligence services and military too. Cuba had long denied having active soldiers or security agents inside Venezuela, but freed political prisoners have often claimed they were interrogated by men with Cuban accents while in custody. Furthermore, despite endless public proclamations of solidarity between the two nations, in truth the Cuban influence behind the scenes of the Venezuelan state is believed to have driven a wedge between ministers most closely aligned with Havana and those who feel that the relationship first established by Chávez and Castro has become fundamentally unbalanced. In essence, that faction considers that these days Venezuela gets little in return for its oil. Venezuela is believed to send around 35,000 barrels of oil a day to Cuba - none of the island's other main energy partners, Russia and Mexico, even come close. The Trump administration's tactic of confiscating sanctioned Venezuelan oil tankers has already begun to worsen the fuel and electricity crisis in Cuba and has the potential to become very acute, very quickly. At best, the future looks increasingly complex for the beleaguered Caribbean island without Maduro at the helm in Caracas. Cuba was already in the grip of its worst economic crisis since the Cold War. There have been rolling blackouts from end to end of the island for months. And the impact on ordinary Cubans has been taxing in the extreme: weeks without reliable electricity, food rotting in fridges, fans and air-conditioning not running, mosquitoes swarming in the heat and the fester of uncollected rubbish. The island has experienced a widespread outbreak of mosquito-borne diseases in recent weeks with huge numbers of people affected by dengue fever and chikungunya. Cuba's healthcare system, once the jewel in the revolution's crown, has struggled to cope. It is not a pretty picture. Yet it is the daily reality for most Cubans. The idea that the flow of Venezuelan oil to Cuba could be turned off by Delcy Rodríguez fills Cubans with dread, especially if she looks to placate the Trump administration following the US raid against her predecessor and stave off the spectre of more violence. President Trump insists Washington is calling the shots in Venezuela now. While those comments were walked back - to an extent - by his Secretary of State Marco Rubio, there is no doubt that the Trump administration now expects nothing less than total compliance from Rodríguez as acting president. There would be further, potentially worse consequences, Trump threatened, if she "doesn't behave", as he put it. Such language - not to mention the US operation in Venezuela itself - has shocked and angered Washington's critics, who say the White House is guilty of the worst form of US imperialism and interventionism seen in Latin America since the Cold War. The removal of Maduro from power amounted to kidnapping, those critics argue, and the case against him must be thrown out at his eventual trial in New York. Unsurprisingly, Trump appears unfazed by such arguments, warning he might even carry it out again against the president of Colombia if need be. He has dubbed the worrying new circumstances in Latin America the "Donroe Doctrine", in a nod to the Monroe Doctrine - a 19th Century colonialist foreign policy principle which warned European powers against meddling in the US sphere of influence in the Western hemisphere. In other words, Latin America is the US's "backyard", and Washington has the unalienable right to determine what happens there. Rubio used that very term - backyard - about the region as he justified the actions against Venezuela on US Sunday talk shows. He also remains key to what comes next for Cuba. The US economic embargo has been in place for more than six decades and failed to remove the Castro brothers or their political project from power. Rubio - a Cuban American former Florida senator and son of Cuban exiles - would like nothing more than to be the man, or the man behind the man, who brought an end to 60 years of communist rule in his parents' homeland. He sees the strategy of removing Maduro and laying down stark conditions to a more compliant Rodríguez government in Caracas as the key to achieving that self-professed goal in Havana. Cuba has faced tough times in the past, and the government remains defiant in the face of this latest act of US military intervention in the region. The 32 "brave Cuban combatants" who died in Venezuela would be honoured, said Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel, for "taking on the terrorists in imperial uniforms". "Cuba is ready to fall," retorted Trump on Air Force One.

**Excerpt**

Nvidia unveils 'reasoning' AI technology for self-driving cars Nvidia boss Jensen Huang on Monday announced Alpamayo, a tech platform the company says will help self-driving cars think like humans. "Alpamayo brings reasoning to autonomous vehicles, allowing them to think through rare scenarios, drive safely in complex environments, and explain their driving decisions," Huang said on stage at the annual CES technology conference in Las Vegas. Huang also said Nvidia has begun producing a driverless car powered by its technology, the Mercedes-Benz CLA, in partnership with the German automaker. The vehicle will be released in the US in the coming months before being rolled out in Europe and Asia. Wearing his trademark black leather jacket, Huang told an audience of hundreds that the project has taught Nvidia "an enormous amount" about how to help partners build robotic systems. Analysts say the announcement reinforces Nvidia's leadership in integrating AI hardware and software, deepening its push into physical AI. "NVIDIA's pivot toward AI at scale and AI systems as differentiators will help keep it way ahead of rivals," said Paolo Pescatore, analyst at PP Foresight, from Las Vegas. "Alpamayo represents a profound shift for NVIDIA, moving from being primarily a compute to a platform provider for physical AI ecosystems." Shares of the AI chip designer rose slightly in after-hours trading following Huang's presentation. It featured a video demonstration of the AI-powered Mercedes-Benz driving through San Francisco while a passenger, sat behind the steering wheel, kept their hands in their lap. "It drives so naturally because it learned directly from human demonstrators," Huang said, "but in every single scenario... it tells you what it's going to do, and it reasons about what it's about to do." Alpamayo is an open-source AI model, with the underlying code now available on machine learning platform Hugging Face, where autonomous vehicle researchers can access it for free and retrain the model, Huang said. "Our vision is that someday, every single car, every single truck, will be autonomous," he told the audience. The project could pose a threat to companies like Elon Musk's Tesla, which offers driver assistance software called Autopilot. "Well that's just exactly what Tesla is doing," Musk posted on social media following the Alpamayo announcement. "What they will find is that it's easy to get to 99% and then super hard to solve the long tail of the distribution." Like Tesla, Nvidia also has plans to launch a robotaxi service by next year in collaboration with a partner, but has declined to name the partner or say where it will be. Nvidia is the world's most valuable publicly traded company, with a market cap of more than $4.5tn (£3.3tn). It became the first company to reach $5tn in October, but has lost value over concerns about whether demand AI is overhyped. The company also revealed that its Rubin AI chips are currently being manufactured and are due for release later this year. The highly-anticipated hardware can compute using less energy than Nvidia's current line of AI chips, and could drive down the cost of developing the technology.

**Excerpt**

Central African Republic president wins third term by landslide Central African Republic (CAR) President Faustin-Archange Touadéra has won a third term after securing an outright majority in last month's presidential election, provisional results show. The 68-year-old mathematics professor was widely expected to win after the main opposition coalition boycotted the poll, citing concerns about electoral fairness. Touadéra campaigned on his security record in the chronically unstable nation after rebels seized power in 2013, a crisis that led the government to enlist support from Russian mercenaries and Rwandan soldiers. He has faced heavy criticism after a 2023 constitution removed term limits, allowing him to keep running for office. More than 2.4 million people registered for the 28 December general election, which observers described as largely peaceful despite delays caused by the late arrival of voting material and problems with the electoral register. Touadéra secured 76% of the vote, according to preliminary results announced late on Monday by the election agency. His closest challengers, Anicet-Georges Dologuélé and Henri-Marie Dondra, both former prime ministers, received 15% and 3% of the vote respectively. Both have called for the results to be annulled, alleging widespread irregularities and fraud. On Friday, Dologuélé said there had been "a methodical attempt to manipulate" the outcome. The main opposition coalition, known by its French acronym BRDC, boycotted the election, saying it was unlikely to be fair. The government has denied the claims. The Constitutional Court has until 20 January to rule on any challenges and declare the final results. The CAR is one of Africa's poorest and most unstable countries, even though it is rich in resources such as diamonds and uranium. The UN estimates that about half the population is dependent on humanitarian aid. Since 2013, the landlocked country has been mired in conflict after rebels seized power, ousting then-President François Bozizé. A 2019 peace deal between the government and 14 armed groups helped ease tensions, though six of the groups later withdrew from the agreement. Analysts say Touadéra's win could bolster the interests of Russia, which has provided security assistance in exchange for access to resources such as gold and diamonds. The CAR was one of the first African countries where Wagner, a Russian mercenary group, became active, providing security to Touadéra.

**Excerpt**

Netflix pulls Chinese drama after Vietnam's outcry over disputed map Netflix has pulled a Chinese drama series from its Vietnam platform after Hanoi objected to an episode featuring a map with contested territorial claims in the South China Sea. The 27-episode romance drama Shine on Me includes images of the so-called nine-dash line which Vietnam has condemned as "inaccurate" and "infringing upon national sovereignty". China uses the line in its maps to demarcate its territorial claims in the South China Sea. Vietnam is one of many countries that object to these claims. Vietnam's culture ministry issued a demand for the series to be removed on 3 January and gave Netflix 24 hours to comply. A BBC check on Tuesday found it could no longer be viewed on Netflix's Vietnam platform. The disputed map appears several times in episode 25 of Shine On Me, in a scene about China's solar power potential. The show's main characters attend a lecture where a map of China which shows part of the nine-dash line is projected on an auditorium screen. Shine On Me is popular within China and other territories, ranking among Netflix's Top 10 shows in Singapore, Taiwan and Vietnam before it was pulled. Beijing has not officially commented on the ban, although its state-run newspaper Global Times published an article on Tuesday urging Hanoi to "separate cultural exchanges from [the] South China Sea issue". In recent years China has increasingly asserted its claims of sovereignty over several land parcels and their adjacent waters in the South China Sea, despite complaints from Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei. Beijing has expanded some islands and built structures on them, and conducted sea patrols which at times have resulted in heated confrontations with the Philippine navy. China argues that various pieces of evidence, from pottery shards to navigational guides used by Chinese fishermen, back up its claims of historical sovereignty. In 2016 an international tribunal in The Hague ruled against Chinese claims in the South China Sea, but Beijing did not recognise the judgement. The dispute between Beijing and Hanoi particularly centres on the Paracel and Spratly island chains, which the nine-dash line loops around on Chinese maps. China says its right to the area goes back centuries to when these island chains were regarded as integral parts of the Chinese nation. Vietnam hotly disputes this, saying China had never claimed sovereignty over the islands in the South China Sea before the 1940s. Hanoi says it has actively ruled over the Paracels and the Spratlys archipelagoes since the 17th Century and that it has the documents to prove it. There are many issues that could provoke public uproar in Vietnam – including what citizens consider insulting depictions of the Vietnam war – but the nine-dash line is one that consistently draws authorities' attention. On most other issues, the Vietnamese government actively works to contain anti-China sentiment, but criticism affirming Hanoi's claims in the South China Sea is one of very few forms of protest it deems acceptable. Between 2019 and 2024, Vietnam filed eight written takedown requests with Netflix, according to the streaming platform's reports. In 2023, Vietnam had also ordered Netflix to remove another Chinese drama, Flight to You, over a similar map. Chinese dramas are not the only productions to be banned by Vietnam for featuring the nine-dash line. Authorities banned Warner Bros' Hollywood blockbuster Barbie in 2023, and DreamWorks' animated film Abominable in 2016, for similar reasons. Additional reporting by Sen Nguyen in Bangkok

**Excerpt**

Canada's Chrystia Freeland to quit as MP and become adviser to Zelensky Canada's former deputy prime minister Chrystia Freeland has said she will leave parliament to accept a job as adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Freeland said her role as an economic development adviser for Ukraine would be unpaid. In July, she will also take on a position to lead the Rhodes Trust, an educational charity, in the UK. She was elected in 2013, and served in key roles such finance, foreign affairs and international trade minister under former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. She broke from Trudeau in late 2024, accusing him in a public resignation letter of failing to take the threat of US tariffs seriously, which helped force his political exit. Freeland posted on X on Monday: "Ukraine is at the forefront of today's global fight for democracy, and I welcome this chance to contribute on an unpaid basis as an economic adviser to [Zelensky]. "In the coming weeks I will also leave my seat in Parliament. I want to thank my constituents for their years of confidence in me. I am so grateful to have been your representative." As well as stepping down as an MP for Toronto's riding of University-Rosedale, a Liberal safe seat, she said she would quit her other role as Canada's special representative for the reconstruction of Ukraine. Earlier on Monday, Zelensky announced on X that Freeland would be taking on the role as adviser. The Ukrainian president said she had "extensive experience in attracting investment and implementing economic transformations". Zelensky's announcement had spurred calls from opposition politicians for her to step down. Conservative foreign affairs critic Michael Chong said "one cannot be a Canadian MP and an adviser to a foreign government". "She must do one or the other," he added. In November it was announced that this summer Freeland would become CEO of the Rhodes Trust, which administers Rhodes scholarships to Oxford University. In September, she stepped down as Carney's minister of transport and internal trade to take on the new role as Canada's special envoy to Ukraine, and announced she would not be running in the next federal election. A former journalist who is of Ukrainian heritage, Freeland has long been a vocal supporter of Kyiv in its war with Russia. In 2014, she was placed on a Kremlin list of Westerners banned from entering Russia in retaliation for sanctions against Moscow. In 2020, Freeland became the first woman to be appointed as finance minister in Canada's history, where she managed Canada's financial response to the Covid pandemic. She is also credited with helping renegotiate the current free trade agreement between Canada, the US and Mexico during President Donald Trump's first term in 2018. Trump later called her "toxic". The USMCA trade deal - or CUSMA in Canada - has been credited with helping the country largely avoid a stiff 35% tariff rate imposed by Trump, who granted Canada an exemption for goods covered by the free trade agreement. That deal is now up for another round of renegotiations this year.

### 7. [Protests and US warnings shake Iran at its weakest point in years](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn564q0vgvxo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

Protests and US warnings shake Iran at its weakest point in years Iran is no stranger to street protests, but several factors surrounding the current unrest make it very serious. Monday marks the ninth day since demonstrations broke out, yet even four or five days were enough for President Trump to issue a direct warning to Iranian leaders over the treatment of protesters, saying the US was "locked and loaded". Then came the US special forces operation targeting Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela, followed by a second warning on Sunday. Such direct and potential threats from a sitting US president, issued while protests are still ongoing, are highly unusual and could embolden demonstrators and encourage the unrest to spread further. Iranian police and security forces have already responded violently almost from the outset, and reports by human rights groups claim that more than 20 people have already been killed. Now eyes are on Trump's possible move. The protests, which began peacefully on Sunday 28 December, were initially driven by public anger over soaring inflation and the sharp devaluation of the local currency against the US dollar which now stands at about 80% higher than a year ago. Iran's economy is in deep trouble, with little prospect for growth this year or next. Official annual inflation stands at around 42%, food inflation exceeds 70%, and some basic goods have reportedly risen in price by more than 110%. Vulnerable position International sanctions led by the United States have played a major role in worsening economic conditions, but they are not the full story. High-profile corruption cases in Iranian courts involving senior officials and their families have reinforced public anger and the belief that parts of the ruling elite are exploiting the crisis. Many ordinary Iranians believe that certain officials and their relatives benefit directly from sanctions through special arrangements that allow them to control imports and exports, move oil revenues abroad, and profit from money laundering networks. Even the government officials believe those who are locally called "Sanctions Profiteers" are to blame more than the sanctions themselves. Merchants in Tehran's Grand Bazaar were among the first groups to openly protest, closing their shops in response to daily currency fluctuations and taking to the streets to demand government intervention to stabilise the markets. Demonstrations soon spread beyond the bazaar to other segments of society. Economic slogans quickly turned political, with calls for the removal of the entire Islamic Republic itself. Students joined the protests, followed by small businesses in other cities and towns and other ordinary Iranians. Within days, chants against Iran's supreme leader once again became a central feature of the demonstrations. The last time Iran experienced unrest on a comparable national scale was around four years ago, when the death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman in the custody of the morality police sparked the most widespread anti-government protests since the establishment of the Islamic Republic in 1979. Those demonstrations, which later became known as the "Mahsa Movement" or "Woman, Life, Freedom", shook the foundations of the state but were eventually suppressed through force and mass arrests. Although the current protests have spread rapidly and persisted for days, they have not yet reached the scale or intensity of the 2022 demonstrations. Journalists in Iran are under immense pressure, and independent international news organisations are either not allowed to report from inside the country or, if granted permission, face severe restrictions on their movements. As a result, much of what is known comes from social media and people on the streets sharing what they witness and record. This makes verification increasingly difficult, especially as social media can also provide fertile ground for fabrications, unfounded claims, and distorted realities, a challenge further intensified by the rise of AI. Against this backdrop, many observers believe the present situation could have more serious consequences than 2022. Iran's government is widely seen as being at its weakest point in decades, facing simultaneous pressure from domestic unrest and a dramatically altered regional environment. Series of setbacks The 12-day war in the summer of 2025 between Iran and Israel marked a turning point. The conflict culminated in direct US involvement, including air strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. The war severely damaged Iran's defence capacity, nuclear infrastructure, and several military and industrial sites. At the same time, Iran's broader regional position has deteriorated. The fall of Bashar al-Assad in Syria deprived Tehran of a key ally, while sustained Israeli attacks on Hezbollah in Lebanon eliminated much of the group's senior leadership. More recently, US operations in Venezuela and snatching of Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, have further narrowed Iran's options abroad. These developments have reshaped the regional and international environment for Tehran. Iran now has fewer allies to rely on in regional conflicts and fewer channels to move oil revenues overseas. This is particularly significant given Iran's heavy involvement in Venezuela's oil sector alongside Russia, and its reliance on complex financial arrangements linked to markets believed to be in China. The disruption of these networks has increased Iran's economic vulnerability at a time of mounting internal pressure. Against this backdrop, Iran's aging supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, appears to be facing one of the most uncertain moments of his rule. More than three decades of careful planning to build regional proxy forces, sanction-evasion mechanisms, and nuclear infrastructure have been undermined or destroyed in a relatively short period of time. With Trump back in the White House and Benjamin Netanyahu in power in Israel, there appears to be no clear diplomatic or strategic path out of the current crisis without a hefty price. For years, Khamenei and his inner circle justified massive spending on regional allies and the nuclear program as necessary investments in Iran's long-term security and technological advancement. Today, that argument appears increasingly hollow. As pressure builds both inside and outside the country, security at home, once presented as the ultimate payoff of those policies, seems more distant than ever.

**Excerpt**

Ten found guilty of cyber-bullying Brigitte Macron Ten people have been found guilty of cyber-bullying Brigitte Macron, the wife of French President Emmanuel Macron, by a Paris court. The defendants were accused of spreading false claims about her gender and sexuality, as well as making "malicious remarks" about the 24-year age gap between the couple. Most of the defendants were handed suspended prison sentences of up to eight months, but one was jailed immediately for failing to attend court. Some had their social media accounts suspended. The judge said the eight men and two women had acted with a clear desire to do harm to Brigitte Macron, making remarks online that were degrading and insulting. Two of the defendants - self-styled independent journalist Natacha Rey and internet fortune-teller Amandine Roy – were found guilty of slander in 2024 for claiming that France's first lady had never existed. They said her brother Jean-Michel Trogneux had changed gender and started using her name. They were later cleared on appeal. The argument used by the appeals court in clearing them was that saying someone had changed gender was not necessarily an "attack on their honour". The Macrons are now taking that case to the high court of appeal. "The most important things are the prevention courses and the suspension of some of the accounts" of the perpetrators, Jean Ennochi, Brigitte Macron's lawyer, said after the verdict was handed down, the AFP news agency reported. Tiphaine Auzière, Brigitte Macron's daughter from a previous marriage, previously told the trial that the cyber-bullying had negatively affected her mother's health and living conditions. She said her mother "has had to be careful about her choices of outfits, of posture... she knows perfectly well that her image will be used to back these theories". While her mother had "learned to live with it", Auzière said, she suffered from the repercussions on her grandchildren who were taunted at school. Monday's ruling in France is a forerunner of a much bigger trial due in the US, where the Macrons have filed a defamation lawsuit against right-wing influencer Candace Owens, who has also voiced conspiracy theories about the first lady's gender. They alleged that she "disregarded all credible evidence disproving her claim in favour of platforming known conspiracy theorists and proven defamers". Owens has regularly repeated the claims on her podcast and social media channels, and in March 2024 stated that she would stake her "entire professional reputation" on her belief that the first lady "is in fact a man". The presidential couple were initially advised that the best course was to ignore the online gossip, because to go to law would simply amplify it. But last year there was a radical change of course. The Macrons decided that the scale of the online attacks was now too large to ignore. So, at risk of exposing their private selves in a US court, they determined to push back against the conspiracy theorists. A conspiracy theory claiming that Brigitte Macron is a transgender woman has circulated since her husband was first elected in 2017. Brigitte Macron first met her now-husband when she was a teacher at his secondary school. The couple married in 2007, when the future French president was 29 and she was in her mid-50s.

**Excerpt**

Thirty-two Cubans killed during US attack on Venezuela The Cuban government says 32 of its nationals were killed during the US operation to seize Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro. It described the dead as members of its armed forces and intelligence agencies were killed "in combat actions", declaring two days of national mourning. The armed forces added the Cubans "fell, after fierce resistance, in direct combat against the attackers or as a result of bombardments of installations" Cuba, a long-standing ally of Venezuela, has for years supplied Maduro with his personal security detail and has personnel throughout the Venezuelan military. Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel said the country had been providing protection to Maduro and his wife "at the request" of Venezuela. US spies had been monitoring Maduro's movements for months before US forces struck, according to US General Dan Caine. Gen Caine said that they had learned where the former leader moved, lived, travelled, ate, and worked. The New York Times reported that the CIA had also recruited a "Venezuelan source" who it says informed the Americans of Maduro's exact location. Many of those killed are believed to have been part of Maduro's close security detail, who were with him at the time. Venezuela has not confirmed how many people were killed, but its armed forces have said that a "large part" of Maduro's security team were among the casualties. An official statement from the Cuban government read: "Our compatriots fulfilled their duty with dignity and heroism". The total death toll - according to an unnamed Venezuelan official cited by the New York Times - stood at 80 and was expected to rise. BBC News has not independently verified that report. In the days following the seizure of Maduro, questions have been raised over whether the Trump administration could consider a similar operation against Cuba, which, like Venezuela, has had decades of adversarial relations with the US. Speaking to reporters on Sunday, US President Donald Trump said military action would not be necessary because "Cuba is ready to fall". He continued: "I don't think we need any action. Looks like it's going down. It's going down for the count." On Saturday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio described Cuba as a "disaster" run by "incompetent, senile men". "If I lived in Havana, and I was in the government, I'd be concerned - at least a little bit," Rubio said. In July last year, Trump signed a memorandum imposing tighter restrictions on Cuba, reversing moves by his predecessor, Joe Biden, easing pressure on the Caribbean island nation. The White House said it would end "economic practices that disproportionately benefit the Cuban government, military, intelligence, or security agencies at the expense of the Cuban people". It also said existing restrictions on Americans visiting Cuba would be more stringently enforced. During his first term as president, Trump took a similar approach to Cuba, implementing a raft of additional sanctions. His administration has continued an economic embargo on Cuba, despite calls by international organisations including the United Nations to end it. The blockade was initially imposed in 1962 and has been in place ever since.

All 116 injured in Swiss ski resort fire identified All 116 people injured in a bar fire at a Swiss ski resort have now been identified, officials have said. Forty people were killed when a fire tore through a busy venue in Crans-Montana on New Year's Eve, with victims' age ranging from 14 to 39 years old. While the dead had all previously been identified, work had been ongoing to establish who the injured are, some of whom remain in a critical condition. Swiss police confirmed on Monday that 83 people remained in hospital, with the injured including at least 12 nationalities. Most of the injured suffered severe burns, which in some cases meant they could not be identified, police have said. Investigators said 119 people had been injured but that number has been revised down in the latest update. A criminal investigation has been launched into the French couple who managed the Le Constellation bar - a venue known to be popular with a younger crowd in the ski resort town, where the drinking age is 16. Sparklers on bottles being carried too close to the ceiling were the likely cause of the fire, a preliminary investigation has found. Beatrice Pilloud, Valais canton lead prosecutor, said in a statement that investigators were looking into whether the acoustic foam on the venue's ceiling was "the cause of the problem", as well as "whether it complies with regulations". Details have begun to emerge about some of those who lost their lives in the tragedy. Among them was Charlotte Niddam, believed to be 15, who was a pupil at two UK schools. Her family wrote on social media: "It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of our beautiful daughter and sister Charlotte." The mother of Arthur Brodard, 16, confirmed he had died in the fire. She said in a video message: "We can start our mourning, knowing that he is in peace and in the light." Italian media named junior golfer Emanuele Galeppini, 16, as also being among the victims. Italian Golf Federation paying tribute to the "young athlete who carried with him passion and authentic values".

Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think? US President Donald Trump has repeatedly said the US should take over Greenland, arguing that it would benefit his nation's security. His demands have been rejected by the island's leaders and by Denmark, of which Greenland is a semi-autonomous territory. What has Trump said about the US controlling Greenland? Trump repeated previous calls for the US to take over Greenland following the US military raid on Venezuela, during which its president Nicolás Maduro and his wife were seized and removed to New York. The day after the operation, Trump told reporters: "We need Greenland from a national security situation. It's so strategic. Right now, Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place." Greenland's Prime Minister Jens Frederik Nielsen responded by saying "that's enough now", and described the idea of US control over the island as a "fantasy". Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said "the US has no right to annex any of the three nations in the Danish kingdom". In 2019, during his first presidential term, Trump offered to buy the island but was told it was not for sale. He revived his interest after returning to the White House in January 2025, and has not ruled out the use of force. His stance has shocked Denmark, a Nato ally that has traditionally enjoyed close relations with Washington, says BBC News diplomatic correspondent James Landale. There have also been controversial high level visits to Greenland. Vice-President JD Vance made the trip in March and gave a speech accusing Denmark of failing to invest enough to protect the territory. A fresh row about US intentions was sparked in late 2025. Trump appointed a special envoy to Greenland, Jeff Landry, who has openly spoken about making the island a part of the US. Where is Greenland and why does it matter to Trump? Greenland - the world's largest island which is not a continent - is located in the Arctic. It is also the most sparsely populated territory. About 56,000 people live there, mostly indigenous Inuit people. About 80% of its territory is covered by ice, meaning most people live on the south-western coast around the capital, Nuuk. Greenland's economy is mainly based on fishing, and it receives large subsidies from the Danish government. But in recent years, there has been increased interest in Greenland's natural resources, including mining for rare earth minerals, uranium and iron. These may become more accessible as global warming leads to the melting of the massive ice sheet that covers the island. Valuable mineral resources have been a key focus of Trump elsewhere in the world, including in his dealings with Ukraine. However, the US president has said: "We need Greenland for national security, not minerals." China and Russia have begun building up their Arctic military capabilities in recent years, according to an Arctic Institute paper. The paper called for the US to further develop its presence in the Arctic to counter its rivals. The US security interest in Greenland dates back much further. After Nazi Germany occupied mainland Denmark during World War Two, the US invaded the island, establishing military and radio stations. After the war, US forces remained in Greenland. Pituffik Space Base, formerly known as Thule Air Base, has been operated by the US ever since. In 1951, a defence agreement with Denmark granted the US a significant role in the defence of the territory, including the right to build and maintain military bases. "If Russia were to send missiles towards the US, the shortest route for nuclear weapons would be via the North Pole and Greenland," said Marc Jacobsen, an associate professor at the Royal Danish Defence College. "That's why the Pituffik Space Base is immensely important in defending the US." American efforts to obtain Greenland also predate the Trump era. "The US has tried a few times to push the Danes out of Greenland and take it over as part of the US, or at least to have full security tutelage of Greenland," said Lukas Wahden, the author of 66° North, a newsletter on Arctic security. In 1867, after buying Alaska from Russia, US Secretary of State William H Seward led negotiations to buy Greenland from Denmark, but failed to reach any agreement. And in 1946, the US offered to pay $100m (equivalent to $1.2bn; £970m today) but the Danish government refused. Why does Denmark control Greenland? Though a part of the continent of North America, Greenland has been controlled by Denmark – nearly 3,000km (1,860 miles) away – for about 300 years. The island was governed as a colony until the mid-20th Century. For much of this time, it remained isolated and poor. In 1953, it was made part of the Kingdom of Denmark and Greenlanders became Danish citizens. In 1979, a referendum on home rule gave Greenland control of most policies within the territory, with Denmark retaining control over foreign affairs and defence. Greenland is home to Danish military bases as well as American ones. What do the people of Greenland think? In response to Trump's threats early in 2026, Prime Minister Jens Frederik Nielsen said: "No more pressure. No more insinuations. No more fantasies of annexation. "We are open to dialogue. We are open to discussions. But this must happen through the proper channels and with respect for international law." When BBC correspondent Fergal Keane visited the island in 2025, he heard one phrase again and again: "Greenland belongs to Greenlanders. So, Trump can visit but that's it." The issue took centre stage during the territory's general election in the same year. Polling suggests that most Greenlanders back independence from Denmark, but that an overwhelming majority of them also reject the idea of becoming part of the US. When Trump first raised the idea of buying Greenland in 2019, many locals said they were opposed to the proposal. "This is a very dangerous idea," said Dines Mikaelsen, a tour operator. "He's treating us like a good he can purchase," said Aleqa Hammond, Greenland's first female prime minister.

Unbearably long wait for justice leaves South African families in limbo Jason Venter has been waiting for his mother's alleged killer to go on trial in South Africa for more than two years, living a life in limbo and hoping to get some closure after her death. The problem is that the country's legal system is jammed up and there are tens of thousands of other cases waiting to be heard. The courts are overwhelmed, with backlogs now so severe that some accused are being given trial dates as far away as four years, violating the principle that justice delayed is justice denied. Some observers argue that this chips away at faith in the legal system, especially worrying for a country affected by some of the highest crime rates in the world. Jason, 27, knows the pain of court delays all too well - and says each postponement feels like losing his mother, Charlene, all over again. With his warm voice betrayed by the sadness on his face, he tells the BBC: "She was my best friend. Everyone who knew her loved her. She was always trying to make the people in her life happy. That's how I remember her, as someone kind and loving." Charlene was 43 and enjoying life as a new grandmother when she was killed in May 2023. She was set alight in her car in what police allege was an act of gender-based violence. She later died in hospital from her injuries. The man accused of killing Charlene has been in custody for two years. But there has been no trial - court records show a series of postponements, for reasons ranging from missing reports and incomplete investigations to unavailable judges and administrative delays. Jason, who works as a call centre manager, says the impact has been both emotional and financial. "I'm the provider now, not only for my wife and baby, but also for my younger sister and grandmother because my mother used to help them out as well." He is desperate for the case to conclude. "No healing can be done without putting something to rest. We don't know what's going to happen, and I'm too scared to even think about it. We need clarity. We need to know what happened." The office of the auditor-general, a watchdog set up under South Africa's constitution, recently reported a waiting list of around 37,000 cases, but the justice department has said that the true figure could be closer to 100,000. One of the main causes of the delays is staffing. South Africa has an estimated 250 judges serving a population of more than 60 million, amounting to around four judges per million people and well below global norms. By comparison, Judges Matter, a South African advocacy group, says India has around 15 judges per million people, while many European countries have more than 200. The figures highlight just how thinly stretched South Africa's judiciary has become. One of the most high-profile examples of prolonged delays is the murder case of Senzo Meyiwa - a beloved footballer who captained the national team, Bafana Bafana, and played for one of the country's most popular clubs, Orlando Pirates, in the local league. In 2014, Meyiwa was shot and killed at the home of his girlfriend, musician Kelly Khumalo, in Vosloorus, south of Johannesburg. At the time, police said the motive appeared to be a burglary gone wrong. The murder dominated headlines, extensive state resources were allocated to crack the case, and police offered a reward of around $23,000 (£17,300) for information leading to the arrest of his killer. But more than a decade later, the case has still not been closed. The trial at the Pretoria High Court has been beset by challenges, including changes in judges and legal teams, and allegations that police botched the investigation. More recently, the head of the public prosecutor's office, Advocate Shamila Bahoti, said factionalism and infighting within the police had affected how the case was investigated over the years. Senior government officials acknowledge the problem but say reforms are coming. Lucky Mohalaba, the head of court administration, says the government accepts criticism that more needs to be done to ensure speedy trials, and plans to hire more magistrates, and possibly extend working hours, to tackle the problem. "We do acknowledge that some matters could have been processed much quicker. We urge the public to not lose faith and hope in the justice system," Mohalaba tells the BBC. But organisations such as Action Society, which support victims through the legal process, say the justice system is failing people. "The system is broken at every step, and sometimes the delays force people to give up. That's especially dangerous in a country like South Africa with a 90% re-offender rate. It becomes a vicious cycle," the group's spokesperson, Juanita du Preez, tells the BBC. "Every single person we assist has lost faith in the criminal justice system, the police and the government, because they are living that failure every day," she adds.

**Excerpt**

The 'magical' blue flower changing farmers' fortunes in India "Until a few years ago, the butterfly pea flower was just another climbing plant in my village," says Nilam Brahma who lives in Anthaigwlao, a village in the northeastern Indian state of Assam. Butterfly pea, also known as aparajita in India, grows as a vine and has a striking blue flower. Around two years ago, Brahma heard that local women were making money selling the flowers, which can be made into tea, or a blue dye. She decided to join them. "The results surprised even me. The first time I earned $50 (£37) from selling dried flowers, I felt a shock. It made me believe I could control my own future," she says. The experiment led to a small business. "I applied for a small loan and invested in solar dryers. The machines helped me dry flowers faster, preserve their colour, and meet the quality standards demanded by buyers." Thailand and Indonesia have been the leading growers and consumers of butterfly pea flowers. But there's growing global demand for the flower, which is attracting entrepreneurs in India. "The global demand for natural colourants is exploding," explains Varshika Reddy, the founder of THS Impex, which exports natural dyes and additives. Behind that demand is consumer appetite for natural ingredients and tighter controls in the US and Europe on synthetic food dyes. In 2021, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved butterfly pea flower as a food additive. However, in 2022 the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) raised safety concerns about using the flower. Both the EU and the UK classify butterfly pea flower as a "novel" food, meaning it still needs approval for widespread use. Nevertheless, Indian entrepreneurs still see potential and want to develop India's market. "The crop is still seen as a backyard ornamental or medicinal plant rather than a commercial commodity," says Reddy. "There is no structured market awareness, no government classification, and no standard pricing mechanism, making farmers uncertain about returns." She is working with farmers to raise production standards. "We work with a dedicated cluster of farmers and their families in Uttar Pradesh, including a significant number of women farmers. "We have established formal contracts... we provide comprehensive agronomy support, including guidance on best farming practices, irrigation management, and crop-specific techniques," she says. Others in India have spotted the commercial opportunity. "When you infuse the flower in hot water, it turns blue, and when you squeeze lemon into it, it turns purple. That felt magical," says Nitesh Singh, who is based just outside Delhi. Like Reddy, he thought that the flower had much more potential in India. "It was here for thousands of years, but nobody knew it could become clean, healthy food," adds Singh. So, in 2018 he founded Blue Tea, hoping to grow an Indian brand, with Indian butterfly peas. To start with, it did not go well. "Initially, we had to import because we couldn't find good quality flowers in India. The flowers here had fewer petals, and once sun-dried, nothing would remain. We needed a flower with more pigment, more petals, to retain colour after drying." Over the past seven years, Singh has been working with farmers to raise the quantity and quality. Having started with five farmers, he now works with 600 across the country. "Training and quality control are the biggest challenges," he says. Plucking the flowers is a key part of the process. It's a job that is predominantly done by women. "Their hands are softer, and they instinctively know how to pluck delicate flowers without damaging the plant. So, women are trained in how to identify the flower for plucking," says Singh. Once harvested, the flowers have to be dried, which also has to be done with care. "Temperature control is extremely important for drying this flower - one mistake and you lose its value," he says. Farmers do some of the drying before the flowers arrive at Blue Tea, where the moisture is checked and further drying is done. "We use very mild temperatures for a longer time. If the heat is too high, the flower burns and you lose its medicinal quality and colour," says Singh. As well as the eye-catching colour, there is some evidence that butterfly pea flowers have health benefits. But more research needs to be done. "When we began reviewing literature, we realised hardly any studies had focused on butterfly pea, despite its strong functional and herbal properties. Most of the available research involved rats and mice," says V Supriya, assistant professor, Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education and Research in Chennai. She ran a small study on people who were pre-diabetic, and found that those who consumed tea made with butterfly pea flowers, showed better sugar control, than those that didn't. "Butterfly pea was largely overlooked. But with evidence now emerging - especially from human trials - its health benefits may make it very popular," says Supriya. Pushpal Biswas owns a small farm in west Bengal, and was introduced to butterfly pea by Blue Tea. "I used to grow rice and vegetables. But many a time I was not able to sell my produce and faced loses," he says. But everything has changed over the past seven years, thanks to the new crop. "It's an easy growing crop," he says about butterfly pea. "With scientific methods, my production jumped from 50kg to 80kg. With the money I made I took more land on lease. My land capacity increased, my production increased, and slowly, my income increased too." For some Indian communities, the flower has made a real impact. "In the last few years, many people from nearby villages have joined us in this cultivation," says Biswas. "This isn't just farming anymore — it has become a network, a community, a business family."

Which countries could be in Trump's sights after Venezuela? US President Donald Trump's second term is being shaped by his foreign policy ambitions. He's followed through on threats against Venezuela by capturing its president and his wife from their heavily fortified Caracas compound in a dramatic overnight raid. When describing the operation, Trump dusted off the 1823 Monroe Doctrine and its promise of US supremacy in the western hemisphere - re-branding it the "Donroe Doctrine". Here are some of the warnings he's made against other nations in Washington's orbit in recent days. Greenland The US already has a military base on Greenland - Pituffik Space Base - but Trump wants the whole island. "We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security", he told journalists, saying the region was "covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place." The vast Arctic island, part of the Kingdom of Denmark, sits roughly 2,000 miles (3,200 km) to the north-east of the US. It's rich in rare earth minerals, which are crucial for the production of smart phones, electric vehicles and military hardware. Currently, China's production of rare earths far outweighs that of the US. Greenland also occupies a key strategic location in the North Atlantic, giving access to the increasingly important Arctic circle. As polar ices melt in the coming years, new shipping routes are expected to open up. Greenland's Prime Minister Jens Frederik Nielsen responded to Trump by describing the notion of US control over the island as a "fantasy". "No more pressure. No more insinuations. No more fantasies of annexation. We are open to dialogue. We are open to discussions. But this must happen through the proper channels and with respect for international law," he said. Any US attempt to seize Greenland would bring it into conflict with another Nato member, likely putting the alliance in peril. Colombia Just hours after the operation in Venezuela, Trump warned Colombian President Gustavo Petro to "watch his ass". Venezuela's neighbour to the west, Colombia is home to substantial oil reserves and is a major producer of gold, silver, emeralds, platinum and coal. It is also a key hub for the region's drug trade - most notably cocaine. Since the US began striking boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific in September - saying, without evidence, they were carrying drugs - Trump has been locked in a spiralling dispute with the country's left-wing president. The US imposed sanctions on Petro in October, saying he was allowing cartels to "flourish". Speaking aboard Air Force One on Sunday, Trump said Colombia was being "run by a sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States". "He's not going to be doing it for very long", he said. Asked whether the US would carry out an operation targeting Colombia, Trump replied, "It sounds good to me". Historically, Colombia has been a close ally in Washington's war on drugs, receiving hundreds of millions of dollars annually in military assistance to counter cartels. Iran Iran is currently facing mass anti-government protests, and Trump warned overnight that the authorities there would be "hit very hard" if more protesters died. "We're watching it very closely. If they start killing people like they have in the past, I think they're going to get hit very hard by the United States," he told reporters on Air Force One. Iran theoretically falls outside the scope defined in the "Donroe Doctrine", but Trump has nonetheless previously threatened the Iranian regime with further action, after striking its nuclear facilities last year. Those strikes came after Israel launched a large-scale operation aimed at decapitating Iran's capability to develop a nuclear weapon, which culminated in the 12-day Israel-Iran conflict. In a Mar-a-Lago meeting between Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week, Iran was said to be top of the agenda. US media reported that Netanyahu raised the potential of new strikes against Iran in 2026. Mexico Trump's rise to power in 2016 was defined by his calls to "Build the Wall" along the southern border with Mexico. On his first day back in office in 2025, he signed an executive order to rename the Gulf of Mexico the "Gulf of America". He has frequently claimed Mexican authorities aren't doing enough to stop the flow of drugs or illegal immigrants into the US. Speaking on Sunday, he said that drugs were "pouring" through Mexico and "we're gonna have to do something", adding that the cartels there were "very strong." Trump said he's offered to send US troops to Mexico to combat cartels, but President Claudia Sheinbaum has publicly rejected any US military action on Mexican soil. Cuba The island nation, just 90 miles (145 km) south of Florida, has been under US sanctions since the early 1960s. It held close relations with Nicolás Maduro's Venezuela, which reportedly supplied roughly 30% of Cuba's oil in exchange for doctors and medics travelling in the other direction. With Maduro gone, Havana could be exposed if oil supply collapses. Trump suggested on Sunday that US military intervention there wasn't needed, because Cuba is "ready to fall." "I don't think we need any action", he said. "It looks like it's going down." "I don't know if they're going to hold out, but Cuba now has no income," he added. "They got all their income from Venezuela, from Venezuelan oil." US Secretary of State Marco Rubio - who is the son of Cuban immigrants - has long called for regime change in Cuba, telling journalists on Saturday: "If I lived in Havana, and I was in the government, I'd be concerned - at least a little bit". "When the president speaks, you should take him seriously," he said.

**Excerpt**

Who is Cilia Flores, Venezuela's first lady seized by the US? When US forces conducted a night raid on the Venezuelan capital Caracas, they didn't just drag President Nicolás Maduro from his compound and put him on a flight to New York - they took his wife too. Cilia Flores, 69, has long been seen as one of the most powerful figures in Venezuela, a political operator in her own right who for decades has shaped the country's fortunes. After years leading Venezuela's National Assembly, she helped consolidate her husband's grip on power after his 2013 presidential election victory. As First Lady, she was dubbed "First Warrior" by Maduro. But in that role she publicly took a backseat - presenting a more family-oriented face to what critics say was a brutal regime. She hosted a TV show, Con Cilia en Familia, and made occasional appearances on state television to dance salsa with her husband. But behind-the-scenes, she is thought to have been one of Maduro's key advisers, and an architect of his political survival. Flores has faced allegations of corruption and nepotism, and in recent years her family members have been found guilty in US courts of cocaine smuggling. She will now face drug trafficking and weapons charges in a New York court, along with her husband - who has long rejected the accusations as a pretext to force him from power. Flores met Maduro in the early 1990s, when - as a young up-and-coming lawyer - she took on the defence of the plotters of the failed 1992 coup attempt. Chief among them: Hugo Chávez, the man who would later become president. It was during those years that she met Maduro, who at the time was working for Chávez as a security guard. "I met Cilia in life," Maduro recounted. "She was the lawyer for several imprisoned patriotic military officers. But she was also Commander Chávez's lawyer and, well, being Commander Chávez's lawyer in prison... tough." "I met her during those years of struggle, and then, well, she caught my eye." From then, both their fates became linked to Chávez and his political movement, known as Chavismo. After Chávez won the presidency in 1998, Flores quickly rose through the political ranks, joining the National Assembly in 2000 and becoming its leader in 2006. For six years she led a virtually one-party parliament, with the main opposition parties refusing to participate in elections, saying they were not free and fair. When Chávez died in 2013, Flores threw her weight behind Maduro, who narrowly won the subsequent presidential election. Months later the pair married, formalising a years-long relationship in which they'd lived together, raising children from previous relationships: three of hers and one of his. "She became a critical piece in Maduro's regime," said José Enrique Arrioja, a Venezuelan journalist and managing editor of Americas Quarterly. "She was not only the emotional confidant of Maduro, but the professional confidant too. And she was very power-driven." Across her career, she has faced numerous allegations of corruption. In 2012, she was accused by unions of nepotism for influencing the hiring of up to 40 people, including numerous members of her family. "My family came here and I am very proud that they are my family. I will defend them," she responded. In November 2015, she became embroiled in the "Narco nephews" case, when two of her nephews - Francisco Flores de Freitas and Efrain Antonio Campo Flores - were arrested in Haiti in a sting operation by the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). They were caught trying to smuggle 800kg of cocaine into the US. Flores accused US authorities of having "kidnapped" her nephews - but a judge sentenced the two men to 18 years in prison for drug trafficking. They were returned to Venezuela in 2022 as part of a prisoner swap under the Biden administration. But last month, the Trump administration announced fresh sanctions on the two nephews - as well as a third nephew, Carlos Erik Malpica Flores - with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent saying: "Nicolás Maduro and his criminal associates in Venezuela are flooding the United States with drugs that are poisoning the American people." "Treasury is holding the regime and its circle of cronies and companies accountable for its continued crimes," he added. The newly unsealed indictment against Flores accuses her - among other things - of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes in 2007 to arrange a meeting between "a large-scale drug trafficker" and the director of Venezuela's National Anti-Drug Office. "To her detractors, she is seen as part of a deeply corrupt, human-rights-abusing and brutal government," says Christopher Sabatini, Senior Fellow and Chatham House's Latin America programme. "She was a power behind the throne," he adds. "But like any good power behind the throne, you really didn't see her hand that much, so no one really knew how powerful she was." She is expected in court on Monday. Additional reporting by BBC Mundo

From Caracas 'fort' to New York court: Maduro's capture in pictures and maps The US says its military operation to capture Venezuela's president took months of planning, but when Donald Trump gave the order to launch, "Operation Absolute Resolve" only lasted about 150 minutes. The surprise early-morning attack on Saturday marked an unprecedented event in modern politics and culminated in the arrest of Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores. Captured by troops from an elite US army unit as they tried to flee into a fortified safe room, the pair are now being held in a detention centre in New York and face narco-terrorism charges. As the sun rose on Saturday, the scale of the military operation in Caracas, Venezuela's capital, was clear. Pictures from Fuerte Tiuna, a huge military complex where top government officials live, show bombed out buildings and charred, smouldering cars. It was at this compound that Maduro and his wife were captured, Venezuelan ruling party leader Nahum Fernández told the Associated Press news agency. Hours earlier - Trump gives the order Operation Absolute Resolve began with reports of explosions at about 02:00 in Caracas (06:00 GMT). The US cut power to the city, Trump has since said, describing it as "dark and deadly". The aim was to disable Venezuela's air defences and clear the path for US military helicopters to get to Fuerte Tiuna. "We assessed that we had maintained totally the element of surprise", Gen Dan Caine, the nation's highest-ranking military officer, said. The BBC has verified five strike locations, including the compound, a port and an airport. Pictures show Fuerte Tiuna on fire, with huge flames visible for miles. Venezuelans have described how US military helicopters flew low over Caracas, heading for Fuerte Tiuna. Some of the helicopters came under fire, but were still able to fly, Gen Caine said. "It was a lot of gunfire," Trump added. Once on the ground, troops from the US Army's Delta Force, an elite special forces unit, moved quickly. They gained access to the compound at 02:01 local time, and the Maduros "gave up" without a struggle, Gen Caine said. But Trump gave more details. The Maduros tried to escape into a safe place, the US president explained, describing it as a military "fortress". "The safe place is all steel, and he wasn't able to make it to the door because our guys were so fast. "It was a very thick door, a very heavy door," Trump told reporters. "He made it to the door. He was unable to close it." But even if they had managed to get into the safe room, Trump said troops could have blown it open in about "47 seconds". From Caracas to Manhattan Now in US custody, Nicolás Maduro and his wife were transported some 2,100 miles (3,400km), to New York City. They were flown out of Caracas by helicopter, and taken to the USS Iwo Jima, a warship stationed in the Caribbean. The team was back "over the water" by 04:29, Gen Caine said. It was on the ship that we got one of the defining pictures of the whole operation - Maduro in handcuffs, wearing ear protectors and a type of blindfold that looked like dark sunglasses. From the USS Iwo Jima, he was first flown to the US Navy base at Guantánamo Bay. The Maduros were then flown on a government plane to Stewart Air National Guard Base in New York state, and then via helicopter to Manhattan. On Saturday, a video was released showing Maduro at the Drug Enforcement Agency's (DEA) headquarters in New York. He and Cilia Flores are now being held in a detention centre in the city. They have been charged with conspiracy to commit narco-terrorism and import cocaine, possession of machine guns and destructive devices, and conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices against the US. "They will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts," said Attorney General Pam Bondi.
