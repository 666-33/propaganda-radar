UK and France to send troops to Ukraine if peace deal agreed The UK and France have signed a declaration of intent on deploying troops in Ukraine if a peace deal is made with Russia, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has announced. After talks with Ukraine's allies in Paris, he said the UK and France would "establish military hubs across Ukraine" to deter future invasion, while French President Emmanuel Macron later said thousands of troops may be deployed. Allies also largely agreed robust security guarantees for Ukraine and proposed that the US would take the lead in monitoring a truce. But the key issue of territory is still being discussed. Russia has repeatedly warned that any foreign troops in Ukraine would be a "legitimate target". Moscow has not yet commented on the announcements made in the French capital. Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory. Heads of state and top officials from the "Coalition of the Willing" took part in Tuesday's talks in Paris. Speaking at a joint press conference after the meeting, Starmer said: "We signed a declaration of intent on the deployment of forces to Ukraine in the event of a peace deal. "This is a vital part of our commitment to stand with Ukraine for the long-term. "It paves the way for the legal framework under which British, French, and partner forces could operate on Ukrainian soil, securing Ukraine's skies and seas, and regenerating Ukraine's armed forces for the future," The UK prime minister added London would participate in any US-led verification of a potential ceasefire. Top US negotiator Steve Witkoff said "durable security guarantees and robust prosperity commitments are essential to a lasting peace" in Ukraine - referring to a key demand made by Kyiv. Witkoff said the allies "largely finished" their work on agreeing security protocols "so that people of Ukraine know that when this [war] ends, it ends forever". Jared Kushner, US President Donald Trump's special envoy and son-in-law, said that after a deal Ukrainians needed to know that "real backstops" were in place to ensure war would "not happen again". Meanwhile, President Macron said Ukraine's allies had made "considerable progress" at the talks. He said "robust" security guarantees for Kyiv had been agreed in the event of a potential ceasefire. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said a "huge step forward" had been made in Paris, but added that he would only consider efforts to be "enough" if they resulted in the end of the war. What Ukraine calls security "guarantees" and what American officials have described as security "protocols" may leave some wiggle room for Trump in the event of coming to Kyiv's defence after a future Russian attack - but there is no doubt Zelensky feels he and his European allies have secured an important concession from Washington. We heard few, if any, new details about where a future ceasefire line would be drawn and what territory, currently occupied by Russian forces, Ukraine would agree to surrender. That prospect is still something many Ukrainians would find hard to swallow, especially as Russia continues to strike against cities and critical infrastructure across Ukraine on a daily basis. But as the snows fall and bitter winds sweep in from the east, Zelensky knows the only alternative to a ceasefire and subsequent peace deal, is another costly, attritional winter of warfare with the inevitable loss of life that will hit Ukraine far harder than Russia. Ukraine's president clearly hopes that guarantees of American monitoring, a multinational force on Ukrainian soil and more weapons support for his armed forces, will convince a sometimes-sceptical population that he is right to sue for peace, bolstered by a growing international coalition. But, in concluding the Paris press conference, Zelensky acknowledged today's "milestone" does not necessarily guarantee peace. Real progress still needs Russian support, and Moscow has been notably silent in recent days about diplomatic efforts to end the war. Putin is known to oppose the prospect of a European-led international force in any disputed areas and will be reluctant to halt his troops', albeit slow, advance if Moscow's war objectives have not been realised. But pressure is undoubtedly growing on both sides to make compromises and end the war. Last week, Zelensky said a peace deal was "90% ready". Agreeing on the remaining 10% would "determine the fate of peace, the fate of Ukraine and Europe". Territory and security guarantees have been at the forefront of unresolved issues for negotiators. Putin has repeatedly warned that Ukrainian troops must withdraw from all of Ukraine's eastern Donbas or Russia will seize it, rejecting any compromise over how to end the war. Zelensky has so far ruled out ceding any territory, but has suggested that Ukraine could withdraw its troops to an agreed point - but only if Russia does the same. Moscow currently controls about 75% of the Donetsk region, and some 99% of the neighbouring Luhansk. The two regions form the industrial region of Donbas. The original US-led 28-point peace plan widely leaked to the media last year was seen by Kyiv and its European allies as being heavily skewed in Russia's favour. This triggered weeks of intensive high-level diplomacy - with Ukraine, the US and European leaders trying to amend the draft. Last month, Kyiv sent the US an updated 20-point plan - as well as separate documents outlining potential security guarantees and provisions for Ukraine's reconstruction, Zelensky said.

### 2. [Venezuelan security forces detain journalists from foreign news organisations](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd6w4y0eq70o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

Venezuelan security forces detain journalists from foreign news organisations At least 14 members of the press were detained in Venezuela on Monday as they were covering the aftermath of the seizure of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro by US forces. The union representing media workers in Venezuela said all but one of those detained were employed by foreign news organisations and were released later on Monday, with one reporter deported. Foreign news media have long faced restrictions in Venezuela, with very few being granted visas to work in the country. Their detention came as Delcy Rodríguez was sworn in as the interim president and shortly after she said that she was willing to co-operate with the Trump administration, which has said it would "run" Venezuela. The union said the media workers were detained by Venezuelan security forces at the National Assembly and its environs, and in the neighbourhood of Altamira - all in the capital, Caracas. At least two of them were seized by agents working for Venezuela's military counterintelligence agency, while others were detained by Venezuela's intelligence service. They said they had their equipment searched, their phones checked and their social media posts and messages read, the union statement added. A Colombian and a Spanish reporter were also detained at Venezuela's border with Colombia near Cúcuta. The two reporters were held for hours incommunicado before being released back into Colombia, the statement said. The union called the incidents "alarming" and called for the release of 23 media workers who remain in detention in the country. The repression has not been confined to media workers. One community leader in the neighbourhood of Petare, in Caracas, told BBC Mundo that there were "hooded men with guns patrolling, checking people's WhatsApp statuses". Caracas resident José, 60, said that people were not able to talk freely about what was happening, with a heavy police and military presence on the streets, as well as pro-Maduro armed groups, known as "colectivos", wearing masks. A 33-year-old masseuse, who did not want to be named, said there was "so much fear in the streets and in our homes". Members of the government appeared keen to show that the security forces were visible in communities, with the Interior Minister, Diosdado Cabello, posting a photo of himself on Monday night posing with armed police. Their presence has struck fear in people critical of the government. One woman described how there are "military people on every corner and groups of armed civilians supporting the government who are causing fear among the population". Another person who asked to remain anonymous told the BBC that "the regime is not allowing news to come out of here." They added that "there are uniformed personnel on the streets stopping people and checking their phones". The journalist detentions come at a volatile time in Venezuela, where just days ago the country's leader, Nicolás Maduro, and his wife were seized by US forces in a pre-dawn raid in which dozens of his bodyguards and security detail were killed. While the seizure prompted celebrations among Venezuelans who oppose Maduro and who have left the country, there were no public displays of joy in Venezuela. Opposition Venezuelans have long denounced the repression they face if they speak out against the Maduro government. More than 2,000 people were arrested during protests in the wake of the 2024 presidential election. The government-dominated electoral council declared Maduro the winner of that election but voting tallies collected by the opposition and verified by independent media suggest that it was won by the opposition candidate. In the crackdown which followed the election, members of the security forces checked people's phone for messages critical of Maduro, prompting many Venezuelans to erase their social media accounts and message history. Many of those arrested at the time were sentenced to lengthy prison sentences after being sentenced for "treason". According to pressure group Foro Penal, there are more than 800 political prisoners being held in Venezuela as of 5 January.

### 3. [US may intercept and seize oil tanker heading for Europe, reports say](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7v0deypjl4o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

US may intercept and seize oil tanker heading for Europe, reports say The US may act to seize a Russian-flagged oil tanker heading across the Atlantic to Europe, CBS News, the BBC's media partner in the US, reported. Two US officials told the broadcaster that American forces plan to intercept the ship, which historically has carried Venezuelan crude oil and is thought to be between Scotland and Iceland. President Donald Trump said last month that he was ordering a "blockade" of sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela, a move the government there described as "theft". Ahead of his seizure of the country's former leader Nicolás Maduro on Saturday, Trump had repeatedly accused Venezuela's government of using ships to bring drugs to American shores. The US coastguard tried to board the Bella 1 last month in the Caribbean when it was believed to be heading towards Venezuela. They had obtained a warrant to seize the ship, accused of breaking US sanctions and shipping Iranian oil. It then dramatically changed course, as well as its name to the Marinera, reportedly reflagging from a Guyanan to a Russian vessel. Its approach to Europe has coincided with the arrival of around 10 US military transport aircraft in the UK as well as helicopters. Russia says it is "monitoring with concern" the situation around the ship. CBS News reported that the two US officials said American forces preferred to seize the ship rather than sink it. The Marinera is believed to be between Scotland and Iceland, with the distance and weather making a boarding difficult. If any US military operation were to be launched from the UK then Washington would be expected to inform its ally. For now the UK Ministry of Defence says it will not comment on other nations' military activities. The US officials quoted by CBS suggested that America could mount an operation like one conducted last month when US Marines and special operation forces working with the US Coast Guard seized The Skipper, a large crude oil tanker flagged out of Guyana, after the vessel left port in Venezuela. AIS (automatic identification system) tracking data for the tanker, which can be spoofed or faked, suggests it was in the North Atlantic approximately 2,000km (1,200 miles) west of continental Europe on Tuesday. Under international law, vessels flying a country's flag are under the protection of that nation but Dimitris Ampatzidis, senior risk and compliance analyst at maritime intelligence firm Kpler, told BBC Verify changing the ship's name and flag might not change much. "US action is driven by the vessel's underlying identity [IMO number], ownership/control networks, and sanctions history, not by its painted markings or flag claim," he said. Ampatzidis added that changing to the Russian registry might cause "diplomatic friction" but would not stop any US enforcement action. Russia's foreign ministry said it was "closely monitoring with concern the abnormal situation around the Russian oil tanker Marinera". "At present, our vessel is sailing in the international waters of the North Atlantic under the state flag of the Russian Federation and in full compliance with the norms of international maritime law," it added. "For reasons unclear to us, the Russian ship is being given increased and clearly disproportionate attention by the US and Nato military, despite its peaceful status," it said. "We expect that Western countries, which declare their commitment to freedom of navigation on the high seas, will begin adhering to this principle themselves." The potential stand-off over the oil tanker comes days after the US shocked the world by using military force to seize Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, a Russian ally, from the capital Caracas. It bombarded targets in the city during the operation to extricate him and his wife on suspicion of weapon and drug offences.

Six dead and hundreds of flights cancelled as snow causes chaos across Europe Intense snowfall and icy weather conditions have caused widespread travel disruption across Europe, with six reported killed in weather-related incidents on the continent. Five people died in two separate regions of France as a result of treacherous driving conditions, authorities said, while one woman was also killed in Bosnia's capital, Sarajevo, after 16in (40cm) of snow fell on the city. Hundreds of flights have been cancelled across Europe, with thousands left stranded at airports in Paris and Amsterdam. Disruption is expected to continue into Wednesday. In France, three people died in two separate incidents in Landes, in the south-west, due to black ice, authorities said. Two more died in separate motor accidents in the Paris region. One was the result of a collision between a driver and a heavy goods vehicle in east Paris, police said. The other was killed after a taxi driver hit a kerb due to snow and plunged into the Marne river, the outlet said. The Balkans has also seen snow and heavy rain. A woman died in the Bosnian capital Sarajevo on Monday after a tree weighed down with wet snow fell on her, police said. French Transport Minister Philippe Tabarot said more snow was expected in the country on Tuesday night and Wednesday. He called on people to travel as little as possible on the roads and to work from home. France's national weather service said 38 districts would be placed on orange alert for snow and black ice on Wednesday. Many train services were cancelled in parts of the country. In France's capital, authorities said Roissy-Charles de Gaulle airport would see 40% of its flights cancelled for several hours on Wednesday morning, so that staff could clear snow from the runways. The capital's Orly airport planned to cancel a quarter of its flights during the same time period. More than 400 flights were cancelled at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport on Wednesday, causing widespread disruption to travel plans. Hundreds of passengers were stranded, with many unable to join connecting flights. Long queues formed at airline counters as people waited for information about when flights would resume. Many of the cancelled flights were operated by Dutch airline KLM, which warned it had nearly run out of de-icing fluid for its aircraft. It blamed the "extreme" weather conditions and supply delays. At Schiphol airport, many travellers complained of long lines and a lack of information. Spanish passenger Javier Sepulveda, who was trying to fly from Amsterdam to Norway, told Reuters news agency the situation at the airport was "chaotic, unacceptable, frustrating, annoying" and "totally unacceptable." He said he started queuing at the KLM help desk at 06:30 local time (07:30 GMT) on Tuesday and that six hours later he was still far from the front of the line. Schipol airport said its "snow crews are working around the clock to keep the runways clear, and aircraft are being carefully de-iced to ensure everyone can travel safely." A further 600 flights scheduled to take off from Schiphol on Wednesday have also been cancelled, Dutch broadcaster NOS reported. Rail journeys were also disrupted. On Tuesday morning, all train services in the Netherlands stopped for a short period after an IT outage. Some trains started running after 09:00 local time (10:00 GMT) but problems persisted during the day. Eurostar services to Paris from Amsterdam were either cancelled or running late.

Children killed after drone hits home in Sudan, medics say At least 13 people have been killed - eight of them children - after a drone strike on a house in the Sudanese city of el-Obeid, says the Sudan Doctors' Network. Most of the dead were part of the same family, the medical group added. Although no group has claimed responsibility, the medics say the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) carried out the attack in an area controlled by the army, and which it has been trying to penetrate for months. As the civil war between Sudan's army and RSF rebels approaches its third year, the scale of suffering has seen it described as the world's worst humanitarian crisis by the UN and aid agencies. To date, more than 11 million people have been forced from their homes by the violence, and hundreds of thousands of people have been killed. Widespread sexual violence is also being used as a weapon of war. Both the RSF and the Sudanese Armed Forces are accused of atrocities. Witnesses say Monday's drone attack on the house in el-Obeid happened in a residential neighbourhood. The Sudan Doctors' Network says it "reflects a dangerous escalation of the policy of indiscriminate killing and systematic bombing of safe residential areas". The city of el-Obeid remains under army control despite the RSF's advance elsewhere in the wider state of North Kordofan. Analysts say it is a key target for the RSF because of its strategic location between Sudan's capital city, Khartoum, and the Darfur region where they have established a parallel government and are accused of genocide. The attack comes days after the RSF hit a power plant in el-Obeid, and also follows what the army claims was an attempted RSF drone attack on the country's largest hydro-electric dam near the northern town of Merowe.

### 6. [Zelensky replaces Ukraine's powerful security service chief](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpv7myg2nw4o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

Zelensky replaces Ukraine's powerful security service chief President Volodymyr Zelensky has reshuffled the leadership of Ukraine's Security Service (SBU), replacing influential Vasyl Malyuk and nominating Maj-Gen Yevhenii Khmara as acting head. The SBU is primarily concerned with internal security and counter-intelligence and, since the beginning of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, it has also played a prominent role in assassinations and sabotage attacks deep inside Russia. Malyuk, who had run the SBU since 2022, gained a reputation for overseeing successful operations against Russia and for purging the SBU from alleged Russian double agents. The reshuffles are the latest in a long series made by Zelensky since the start of the war. Malyuk's name is known across Ukraine. After all, last June he co-ordinated the daring "Spider Web" attack, which saw more than 100 Ukrainian drones strike air bases deep inside Russian territory. Khmara, his replacement, was also involved in the preparation of that operation. So it did not come as a surprise that Malyuk's dismissal earlier this week was widely criticised within Ukraine, including by several high-profile military commanders. The impression that the decision made by President Zelensky was short-sighted was cemented by reports that Malyuk had initially refused to step down voluntarily. Although he has been dismissed from the position of SBU chief, he has been asked to continue leading special operations against Russia. Ukraine needed more "asymmetric operations against Russian forces", Zelensky said, adding that Malyuk was "best at this". Khmara's appointment has gone some way in quelling fears about the SBU's future effectiveness. But former SBU operative Ivan Stupak argues his reputation - though solid - is limited to a certain sphere and that it is unclear whether he will be able to translate his experience to running the wider SBU. Stupak also believes that Malyuk's dismissal is connected with the appointment of former spy chief Kyrylo Budanov as Zelensky's new chief of staff. "Malyuk and Budanov are at loggerheads," he told the BBC, implying that Budanov had heavily influenced Zelensky's decision and that Khmara would now be "in the hands" of Budanov. Other analysts disagree. Oleksandr Notevskyi, political analyst for Ukrainian media outlet Grunt, praised Khmara's appointment, pointing out his successes in heading Alpha, one of the top elite divisions of the SBU: "He's young, he's experienced, he is one of the authors of the Spider Web operation." In a statement, the SBU described Khmara as a decorated and "experienced special-purpose officer" who was involved in liberating the Kyiv region in 2022 and fighting the Russians in the occupied region of Donetsk. Khmara's appointment will need to be confirmed by the Ukrainian parliament, which may yet reject it. Other options are on the table, Notevskyi said. After nearly four years of war, Ukraine is struggling to push back Russian forces in the conventional way - on the battlefield and along the long front line in the east of the country. It has had more success targeting oil fields, weapons factories and - as in the case of the Spider Web attack - air bases and valuable aircraft. At this particular juncture of the war with Moscow, Notevskyi argued, "whoever leads the security service should be someone who is specialised in eliminating Russia's military capacities on the territory of Russia". Last week, Zelensky announced significant changes to his top team. Mykhailo Fedorov was nominated as new defence minister, while foreign intelligence chief Oleh Ivashchenko replaced Budanov. Many of Zelensky's reshuffles have been criticised by commentators as damaging to the country at a time of crisis. Using a football analogy, Stupak argued that Zelensky was like a manager going to the substitute bench for replacements. "But his bench is quite short, and he's running out of people to use again and again," he said. Additional reporting by Volodymyr Lozhko and Anastasiia Levchenko

### 7. [Swiss ski bar not inspected for five years before deadly fire, mayor says](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdx4zxk1np0o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

Swiss ski bar not inspected for five years before deadly fire, mayor says The Swiss bar that was the scene of a fire which killed 40 people and injured 116 had not undergone safety checks for five years, authorities have said. The mayor of Crans-Montana, Nicolas Feraud, told a Tuesday news conference that he could not explain why Le Constellation bar had not been checked in so long, but that the council was "profoundly sorry". The venues should have been checked annually. "We regret that - we owe it to the families and we will accept the responsibility," he said. He added that sparklers - which are believed to have caused the fire when they were raised too close to the ceiling - will be banned in local venues. Local authorities will now bring in an external contractor to inspect and audit all 128 venues in the area. Feraud conceded there was a team of five people inspecting more than 10,000 buildings in Crans-Montana and could not explain why the bar had not been inspected since 2019. Taking repeated questions on why the bar had not been checked in so long, Feraud said: "I have no answer for you today." "We're profoundly sorry about that and I know how hard that will be for the families." "I'm not resigning, no, and I don't want to," he later added. Feraud said it would be "down to the judges" to decide whether members of the local authority would be included in a criminal investigation that has been opened by Swiss prosecutors. When the fire occurred on New Year's Day, the bar seemed to have many more people in it than legally permitted, which Feraud said was the responsibility of the managers of Le Constellation to regulate. Feraud said the maximum capacity was 200 people, with emergency exits designed to cater for 100 people on each side of its two levels. However he did not know if the exit on the basement level was working. Swiss prosecutors have placed the two bar managers under criminal investigation, which local media have named as French couple, Jacques and Jessica Moretti. They are both suspected of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence, the prosecutors' office in Valais said. Prosecutors have said they believe the fire started when people celebrating the New Year raised champagne bottles with sparklers attached, setting light to sound-insulating foam on the ceiling of the basement bar. Feraud said the use of sound-proofing material on the ceiling of the bar and allowing sparklers in the venue was extremely negligent. Swiss national broadcaster RTS has shown footage from 2019 of partygoers holding bottles with sparklers. An employee warns them to be careful of the "mousse" - the French word for the acoustics foam panelling. Questioned on the video, Feraud said it was likely no-one in the council saw the images and he wished it had been brought to his attention at the time as he would have investigated. Feraud said while inspections of the facility were conducted in 2016, 2018 and 2019, there were none from 2020 to 2025. He told the press conference in 2015 the owners renovated the bar and it did not require a permit, which was when the sound insulation foam was stuck on the ceiling. "There were never any checks on this soundproofing foam. Our security agents did not consider it necessary," Feraud said. Investigators will be assessing several elements, including the nature of the foam, compliance with standards for access and emergency exits in the basement. Accounts from reported scenes include that people pushed and shoved, notably on the staircase leading to the basement. Under Swiss regulations, doors are required to open in the direction of the exit and be clearly signposted. Under Switzerland's political system, power is distributed among three levels of the confederation, 26 cantons and then about 2,131 municipalities. While safety regulations are set by cantons, they need to be implemented by local authorities. The Crans-Montana's failure to adhere to fire safety regulations by not inspecting Le Constellation from 2020 to 2025 may point to a potential fault with the system.

**Excerpt**

Macron hosts Ukraine and allies to try to cement security guarantees French President Emmanuel Macron is hosting Ukraine's leader Volodymyr Zelensky and other key allies of the country as efforts intensify to agree security guarantees for Kyiv in the event of a ceasefire with Russia. Heads of state and top officials from more than 30 countries - part of the so-called Coalition of the Willing - are meeting in Paris, including US mediators in peace talks Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump's son-in-law. Zelensky met Trump recently and said his plan to end the war with Russia was 90% agreed. However, the proposals have yet to be presented to Russia, whose response so far has been far from encouraging. The outstanding 10% of the agreement that's yet to be decided concerns territorial concessions Kyiv is being asked to agree to. Moscow currently controls about 75% of the Donetsk region, and some 99% of the neighbouring Luhansk. The two regions form the industrial region of Donbas. Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and has been making slow progress on the ground recently and, therefore, is unwilling to compromise on its aim to seize full control of Donbas. Russia has also consistently opposed any idea of a temporary ceasefire and has intensified its attacks in Ukraine, particularly aimed at paralysing its power supplies in the middle of a harsh winter. Ukraine has also hit back with drones - the latest target being an oil depot in the Lipetsk region of western Russia. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte are among the participants at the Paris meeting. Leaders are expected to seek agreement on details that include a multi-national force to reassure Ukraine after a peace deal, what security guarantees to offer Ukraine in the event of a renewed Russian attack - as well as helping Ukraine's armed forces and its economy. For months, the so-called "backstop" has been on the agenda - the desire among Ukraine's European allies to secure a pledge from the US that it will be involved in responding to Russia should it violate the terms of a peace deal. Following talks between Zelensky and Trump in Florida last month, the Ukrainian leader said Washington had offered security guarantees for 15 years - but a time frame for their implementation is not yet clear. The talks in Paris are being overshadowed by the aftermath of the US's military action in Venezuela, where elite troops went in to seize the country's President Nicolás Maduro and take him to face drugs and weapons charges in New York. Following the raid, Trump said the US would "run" Venezuela for an unspecified period of time. He also said the US was returning to last century's policy of US supremacy in its sphere of influence in the Western hemisphere. Looming larger over the Paris talks is Trump's subsequent insistence that the US wants to annex Greenland - the semi-autonomous territory that is part of Denmark, a Nato ally. The repeated threat prompted Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen to say any such move from the US would be the end of the trans-Atlantic alliance. European leaders have been reluctant to criticise Trump's intervention in Venezuela and its perceived implications for the world order. But many, including Starmer and Macron, have sided with Denmark over Greenland. As host of the talks, Macron will be keen not to have the issue derail the focus on Ukraine.

**Excerpt**

US Congressman Doug LaMalfa dies unexpectedly at 65 Doug LaMalfa, a Republican Congressman from California, has died unexpectedly at age 65, colleagues announced on Tuesday. President Donald Trump offered a tribute to LaMalfa, saying he wanted "to express our tremendous sorrow at the loss of a great member - a great, great, great member". The congressman's cause of death was not immediately clear. LaMalfa was a former rice farmer elected to congress in 2013. He focused on water and agriculture issues during his tenure. His death shaved an already-thin Republican majority in the US House of Representatives to just a few seats, following the resignation on Monday of former Trump ally Marjorie Taylor Greene. "He was a fantastic person," Trump said. "He voted with me 100% of the time." Minnesota Congressman Tom Emmer called his colleague a "staunch advocate for his constituents and rural America". LaMalfa earned a degree in agriculture business from California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo. He served as a state lawmaker before being elected to congress, where he fought for help for fire victims in his northern California district and "worked to protect families from overregulation, ensure American farmers and ranchers can continue to feed the world", according to his congressional website. Greene's resignation and LaMalfa's death left Republicans with a 218-213 majority, meaning they have only a two-vote cushion - if three don't vote or side with Democrats, Republicans lose. Within hours after LaMalfa's death was announced on Tuesday, news emerged that another Republican congressman had been hospitalized after a car wreck. Indiana Congressman Jim Baird was recuperating and "expected to make a full recovery", according to a statement posted to social media. There are currently four vacancies in the House with Democrats favoured to fill two of them - in special elections in Texas at the end of January, and in New Jersey in the spring. Under California law, Governor Gavin Newsom will have 14 days to call for a special election to fill LaMalfa's seat.

The painful questions for Nato and the EU as Trump threatens Greenland Earlier today, the so-called Coalition of the Willing, largely made up of European leaders, met in Paris with envoys of US President Donald Trump, to try to make further progress on a sustainable peace deal for Ukraine. With Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky insisting a plan to end the war with Russia is "90% of the way there", no-one in that room wanted to jeopardise keeping the Americans onboard. But there was an immense elephant in that grand and glittering Paris meeting and the underlying atmosphere was extremely tense. Bear in mind the events of the last few days: the Trump administration's controversial intervention in Venezuela and the US president's insistence soon after, that "we need Greenland from the standpoint of national security". Greenland is the world's largest island - it's six times the size of Germany. It lies in the Arctic but is an autonomous territory of Denmark's. At the Paris meeting, Mette Frederiksen, Denmark's Prime Minister, was sitting opposite two powerful figures representing Trump: special envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner. She was under pressure from European colleagues not to antagonise the US over Greenland, in case that impacts US support for Ukraine. Europe's leaders would have far preferred to keep Greenland and the debate on Ukraine separate. But with the political temperature mounting from Washington and Copenhagen, leaders of big European nations at the Paris meeting issued a statement saying: "Greenland is part of Nato. Security in the Arctic must therefore be achieved collectively, in conjunction with Nato allies including the United States". "It is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland," the statement added. The communique was welcomed by Greenland's prime minister, Jens Frederik Nielsen, but critics say it was slow to be put together and, because of the limited number of signatories to the statement, it failed to show a Europe united in purpose. "Had there been a common statement from all 27 EU partners, plus Nato ally the UK, in support of Danish sovereignty, that would have sent a powerful message to Washington," Camille Grande of the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR) think tank told me. He was the Assistant Secretary General for Defence Investment at Nato from 2016-22. Consider the irony at play at the France meeting. Multiple European national and other leaders, including of Nato and the EU, are trying to engage the Trump administration in safeguarding the future sovereignty of a European country (Ukraine) against the aggressive territorial ambitions of an outside force (Russia), just after the US has swooped into sovereign Venezuela militarily, taking its president into custody, while also continuing to actively threaten the sovereignty of another European nation (Denmark). To make matters even more stark - Denmark and the US are both members of the transatlantic alliance Nato. They are, according to Copenhagen, extremely close allies. Or were. The question is, were Trump to make good on his ambition to bring Greenland under US control, would it mark not just an existential threat to Nato but also a major crisis for the EU? Europe risks being trampled underfoot This is not the first time Trump has spoken of his determination to control Greenland. He's suggested buying it in the past. He's also refused to rule out taking it by force. On Sunday he insisted that the island is "so strategic right now, Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place. We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security and Denmark is not going to be able to do it." Denmark refutes that last statement. It recently pledged to invest $4bn in Greenland defence including boats, drones and aircraft. Under a bilateral agreement, the US has a military base already on Greenland - established at the beginning of the Cold War. It has reduced the number of personnel there from around 10,000 during peak Cold War operations to around 200 and the US has long been accused of taking its eye off Arctic Security, until now. Denmark has indicated it is open to discussion about a bigger US presence on the island and more but faced with the US President's threat of unilateral action, Friederikson said on Monday that Trump's ambition to take Greenland should be taken seriously. After the US administration's actions in Venezuela this weekend, her colleagues across Europe are doing just that. Speaking to me on condition of anonymity one EU official said: "This whole situation has just underlined - once again - Europe's fundamental weakness vis a vis Trump." While Denmark's nordic neighbours immediately rushed verbally to its defence after Trump's weekend comments on Greenland, initially there was deafening silence from Europe's so-called Big Three - London, Paris and Berlin. Eventually, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said on Monday that Denmark and Greenland alone could decide the island's future. Germany's Chancellor, Friedrich Merz has said similar in the past. French President Emmanuel Macron visited Greenland in June in a gesture of solidarity with Copenhagen. But direct criticism of the US has been notably absent. And this is the crux of the matter. Trump's forthright manner, some call them his bullying tactics, have made European allies extremely nervous. They've generally chosen to try to manage the US president, often in an attempt to safeguard bilateral relations, rather than stand up individually or together, and risk confronting the US president and facing potential consequences. In the new world of Big Power Politics we now inhabit, where the US and China, along with others like Russia and India, dominate, Europe at best looks like it's standing on the sidelines, and risks being trampled underfoot. How the EU deferred to Trump Every year I have covered EU politics, the bloc pledges to play a greater role on the global stage, but when it comes to Trump, it has looked decidedly weak. At the end of last year, the EU failed to fulfil a pledge to financially support Ukraine using Russian state assets frozen in the EU. They found the money by other means, but critics say the bloc very publicly missed sending a potentially strong message both to Moscow and to the Trump administration, that has repeatedly dismissed the bloc as feeble. And in the one area where the EU has long strutted internationally - as a huge trading power, it has chosen once again to defer to Trump. When he slapped 15% tariffs on EU goods last year, the bloc swallowed its pride and promised not to retaliate, insiders say because it feared losing US support this continent relies on for its security and defence. And now there's Greenland and Denmark - where EU countries are deeply divided in their attitudes towards the Trump administration and therefore to what extent they might stick their neck out for Copenhagen. As a result, Juliane Smith, the US ambassador to Nato until Trump's re-election as president, told me this situation "risks breaking the EU" as well as being an existential dilemma for Nato. Denmark's prime minister warned on Monday that US unilateral action over Greenland could break the NATO alliance altogether. Some might note that Donald Trump has never been a big fan of the transatlantic alliance. "Europe should take President Trump and his team seriously when they talk about "getting" Greenland," Julianne Smith told me. "That means doing more than urging restraint. The leading powers in Europe may want to begin contingency planning; consider how they can make best use [of international meetings, such as] the upcoming Munich Security Conference and Davos where US senior officials will be present; and also consider bold and innovative ideas like new defence pacts." Nato treaties do not make a distinction between an attack on an ally from outside countries or from another Nato ally but there is an understanding that the alliance's Article 5 - nicknamed its all for one and one for all clause - isn't applicable to one Nato country attacking another. Take, for example, strife between member states Turkey and Greece over Cyprus. The worst violence was in 1974 when Turkey invaded. Nato did not intervene but its most powerful member the US was able to help mediate. If we come back to geography, Denmark is one of Nato's smaller allies, though a very active one. The US is Nato's biggest, most powerful member. By far. The deep-seated nervousness in Europe right now is palpable. Big European powers may have issued their joint statement underlining Nato as a forum to discuss Arctic security and insisting that only Denmark and Greenland can decide the islands future, but how far would the UK , France, Germany and others actually go to guarantee that sovereignty? "Nobody's going to fight the United States militarily over the future of Greenland," said the confident sounding White House deputy chief of staff in an interview with CNN on Monday. ECFR's Camille Grande told me tensions over Greenland point - once again, he says - "at the need for the Europeans to reduce security dependencies on the US and to speak with one voice." Trump got all Nato allies - bar Spain - last summer to commit to massively increase spending on their own defence. But Europe is still heavily reliant on the US in many areas including intelligence gathering, command and control and air capabilities. Washington is well aware of this. Nato insiders say, right now, even in meeting behind closed doors European member states of the alliance can hardly bring themselves to contemplate what could happen if Washington were to move in on Greenland militarily. They may have to.
