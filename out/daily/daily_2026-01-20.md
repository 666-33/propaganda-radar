Confronted over Greenland, Europe is ditching its softly-softly approach to Trump Something in Europe has snapped. Donald Trump doubled down again on Monday night in his insistence that the US "has to have" Greenland for national security reasons. He predicted that Europe's leaders aren't "gonna push back too much". But that's not the plan they have in mind when their paths cross with the US president at the World Economic Forum (WEF) on Wednesday. Greenland is a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark - a member of the EU and of Nato. President Trump is now leaning heavily on Denmark's allies in both those organisations to abandon Copenhagen and let the US take control of Greenland, or face punitive taxes on all their exports to the United States. It's a horror scenario for European economies, which are already in the doldrums, especially those reliant on exporting to the US like Germany's car industry and Italy's luxury goods market. On Monday Germany's finance minister said “we will not allow ourselves to be blackmailed,” after an emergency meeting ahead of the WEF with his French counterpart. The Trump threats landed like a slap in the face of European governments, who (separately, in the case of the EU and the UK) had only just settled tariff deals with the US president last year. "We're living through uncharted territories. We've never seen this before. An ally, a friend of 250 years, is considering using tariffs… as a geopolitical weapon," said France's Finance Minister Roland Lescure. His German counterpart Lars Klingbeil added: "A line has been crossed... You'll understand that today I'm not saying exactly what will happen. But one thing must be clear: Europe must be prepared." All of a sudden, the softly-softly approach to Trump, that Europe's leaders had clearly favoured since he returned for a second term to the White House, seems to have passed its sell-by date. Europe's good cop, bad cop approach It's too early to read the last rites on transatlantic relations altogether but the EU, at least, is hoping to approach the US president in Switzerland this Wednesday at the Global Economic Forum "speaking softly, while carrying a big stick" to paraphrase a former US president. Theodore (Teddy) Roosevelt believed that, to achieve your goals, you need diplomacy backed by credible power. And Europe now seems to be adopting a good cop, bad cop approach. European leaders are telling President Trump they'll support him in prioritising Arctic security, so there's no need for him to go it alone over Greenland. At the same time, EU diplomats have let it be known they're considering imposing €93 billion (£80 billion) worth of tariffs on US goods or even restricting the access of American businesses, possibly including banks and high tech companies - to the bloc's massive single market, if Trump goes ahead with his "Greenland tariffs" as they've become known. These retaliatory measures would most likely have a knock-on effect on US consumers too. European Union investors have a massive presence in nearly all 50 US states and are said to be responsible for employing 3.4 million Americans. The EU has a weak voice on the world stage of international diplomacy. The bloc is made up of 27 often bickering countries. But it has huge clout when it comes to the global economy and trade, where decisions are largely taken by the European Commission on behalf of EU single market members. The European Union is the world's biggest trader of goods and services, accounting for nearly 16% of world trade in 2024. So, Brussels is crossing its fingers that President Trump will climb down from from his maximalist position and negotiate a compromise solution, if he realises, that he may end up gaining an island (Greenland) but he'll probably lose close allies (Europe), and be seen as responsible for US consumer costs going up (because of EU retaliatory tariffs). "Our priority is to engage, not escalate," EU Commission deputy spokesperson Olof Gill said on Monday. "Trump is forcing the Europeans to grow a spine," says Niclas Poitiers, an economist and expert in international trade at the Brussels-based Bruegel think-tank. "[While] the damage of [Trump's] tariffs is very manageable for Europe… the much bigger question here is not economic but security and foreign policy. "The EU cannot afford not to react." Trust in US security guarantees But on Monday, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent appeared less than impressed. Speaking in Davos, he painted a picture of a US president with his mind set: "The president is looking at Greenland as a strategic asset for the United States. We are not going to outsource our hemispheric security to anyone else." European tariff retaliation would be "unwise", he warned. And here Europe feels stuck. Damned if it takes action. Damned if it doesn't. Some in Europe worry that if they are now more confrontational with Trump, they risk alienating the US even further. And the brutal truth is: Europe needs Washington to secure a sustainable peace deal for Ukraine and for its own continental security. Despite pledging more defence-spending, Europe is still heavily reliant on the US. While also reiterating his support for Danish and Greenlandic sovereignty, Sir Keir Starmer, the UK prime minister, was at pains to make that point on Monday, saying it was in the UK's "national interest that we continue to work with the Americans when it comes to defence, to security and to intelligence. "Our nuclear deterrence is our foremost weapon. A deterrent when it comes to securing the safety of everybody in the United Kingdom is my primary duty and that requires us to have a good relationship with the United States." But, if Europe continues to try to "manage" president Trump, rather than stand up to him, when he is threatening the sovereignty of his fellow Nato ally (Denmark), and brandishing economic sanctions over other allies if they support Copenhagen, then the continent risks looking seriously weak. On X on Monday the EU's top diplomat Kaja Kallas wrote, "We have no interest to pick a fight, but we will hold our ground". As a former prime minister of Estonia, a country that fears the looming shadow of an expansionist Russia, she is keen to demonstrate to Moscow that Europe can - and will - bare its teeth, if pushed. "Europeans can't shy away anymore," Tara Varma told me. She's an expert in security and geopolitics at think tank, German Marshall Fund. "They tried personal diplomacy alone [with Donald Trump] over the last year, in order to try and tie him into Europe's collective defence and guaranteeing Ukraine's security after a ceasefire with Russia," she said. But if he can suddenly turn around (as he just has), linking economic and security issues and threatening Nato, if he doesn't get his way over a certain issue, then, she says, how much trust can Europe ultimately put in US security guarantees under this administration?" Putin and the Board of Peace Watching all this from the sidelines is not only Russia, but China. In their eyes the West - traditionally with the US and Europe tightly-knit at its core, dominant for decades in global politics - is now unravelling. The world is increasingly dominated by a number of big powers, including Russia and China, but also India, Saudi Arabia and, to an extent, Brazil. China hopes Donald Trump's apparent fickleness with his allies may make Beijing appear a more stable, reliable partner and drive more international trade its way. Canada, which President Trump had threatened to make the 51st state of the US, has just agreed to a limited trade deal with Beijing. It's trying to reduce its exposure to Washington. The US president has also shown little regard for multilateral institutions like Nato and the United Nations set up by western powers after the second world war, to manage global order. Some point to the Board of Peace that President Trump is now establishing, and that he reportedly wants to stage a signing ceremony for this Thursday in Davos. Many world leaders and leading business figures are attending the conference. The Board is ostensibly designed to oversee the reconstruction of Gaza after Israel's devastating two year offensive, aimed at destroying Hamas following its attack on Israel on 7 October 2023. But the Board's charter calls for "a more nimble and effective international peace-building body", suggesting its remit would be far wider, possibly to rival the UN. That's how France's President sees it. A source close to Emmanuel Macron issued a statement on Monday saying that France did not plan to accept an invitation that, "along with many countries", it had received to join the Board of Peace. "The [Board's] Charter... raises major questions, particularly with regard to respect for the principles and structure of the United Nations, which cannot be called into question under any circumstances," the statement reads. The Kremlin said on Monday that Vladimir Putin had also been asked to join the Board, suggesting that Trump is keen to maintain ties with the Russian president, despite Moscow's four-year long assault on Ukraine and its failure so far to accept a US-backed peace plan. Questions have been raised too about Trump's overarching role on the Board, and his demand that world leaders pay $1 billion for permanent membership. But Tara Varma insists that the Peace Board isn't about peace. "How can it be, if you invite leaders like Putin to be part of it? "Trump wants to be seen as a peacemaker. He wants the headlines, but without doing the hard graft to lay the groundwork needed for peace to be durable. His is more of a hit and run strategy. "He can't replace multilateral institutions like the UN that have been around for 80 years." Relations are strained but not broken Perhaps, though, President Trump, with his flouting of decades-old international norms, is shaking some of these multilateral institutions up a bit, pushing or even forcing them to modernise and become more relevant. The membership of the UN security council should arguably be less western-centric, and more representative of changes in global power structures. Nato's European members have admitted they ought to be paying more for their own defence. Trump is not the first US president to say that they should, though he's far blunter. It was after he threatened that the US would no longer defend nations that didn't pay their way, that all Nato members except Spain agreed to dramatically increase security spending. Back to Greenland, polls suggest 55% of Americans don't want to buy the island and 86% oppose a military takeover by the US. Denmark and other European powers have been lobbying lawmakers on Capitol Hill to persuade them that Greenlandic and Danish sovereignty must be protected. Transatlantic relations aren't broken yet, though they are damaged. Donald Trump is still picking up the phone to his pal, the Italian premier, Giorgia Meloni, to Starmer, and to Nato's Secretary General Mark Rutte. Lines of communication are still open. Ultimately, though, if Europeans want to try to cut through with Donald Trump, they will have to stick together. Not only the EU's disparate member states, not just Nato: all countries together. And the UK, with its closer relationship with the US will be key here. But Europe's leaders are torn between wanting to do what they see as right internationally, and their own domestic concerns. If a full-blown transatlantic trade war were to break out, that would hurt their voters. All singing from the same sheet over Greenland for any length of time, is going to be tough.

Surfer injured in fourth shark attack in Australian state in 48 hours A surfer has been bitten by a shark, the fourth attack along Australia's New South Wales (NSW) coastline in under 48 hours. The 39-year-old man "sustained a wound to his chest" after a shark bit his board on the Mid North Coast on Tuesday morning, police said. He has been released from hospital. It follows three other attacks in Sydney over the past two days. All beaches in Sydney's northern area will remain closed until further notice, said police. The attacks follow days of heavy rains, which NSW Superintendent Joseph McNulty had earlier said may have created a "perfect storm environment" for shark attacks. Rain flushes nutrients into the water, which can draw sharks closer to shore. The attack on Tuesday took place near the Point Plomer campground, about 450km (279 miles) north of Sydney. Steve Pearce, the chief executive of Surf Life Saving NSW, said the surfer was "very fortunate to not have sustained any serious injuries", ABC reported. "We really strongly advocate that nobody swim or surf near river mouths because it's obviously an area where sharks congregate," Pearce said. "If it's dirty water I'd think twice about going in there." A young surfer had a similarly lucky escape at Dee Why Beach in Sydney on Monday, but a shark attack at nearby Manly hours later left a 27-year-old with "life-changing" injuries. On Sunday, a 12-year-old boy was also critically injured when bitten at a popular Sydney Harbour beach. Authorities believe bull sharks were involved in most of the recent attacks. Bull sharks, which can be found in both fresh water and salt water, are "one of the few sharks that are potentially dangerous to people", the Australian Museum says. They are the third deadliest shark species, according to the International Shark Attack File. Last November, a woman was killed and a man was seriously injured after being attacked by a bull shark on a remote beach, also on the NSW Mid North coast. Bull sharks are typically seen around Sydney in January and February - the summer months in Australia - as the "water is at their preferred temperature", Dr Daryl McPhee, associate professor of environmental science at Bond University, told the BBC. Though Australia is a global shark attack hotspot, the chances of being attacked are still minute - making this string of shark attacks in NSW a rare phenomenon. "This series of bites from bull sharks in such a short period of time is highly unusual," said McPhee. Police on Monday advised the public to avoid waterways in NSW due to recent weather, which has decreased water quality and visibility. "I would recommend not swimming in the harbour or our other river systems across NSW at this time," Superintendent Joseph McNulty told reporters. Rain can concentrate fish that bull sharks prey on downstream in rivers and beaches, McPhee said, adding that "bull sharks are well adapted to feeding in murky water after rain". "Where you find the fish, you find the bull sharks. Unfortunately, that sometimes occurs at popular beach locations."

'Europe is at a total loss': Russia gloats over Greenland tensions Listen to Donald Trump and you would think Moscow and Beijing were lying in wait off the coast of Greenland, ready to pounce to boost their power in the Arctic. "There are Russian destroyers, there are Chinese destroyers and, bigger, there are Russian submarines all over the place," President Trump said recently. That is why, according to America's president, US control of Greenland is essential. So how do you think Moscow has reacted to its alleged plot being uncovered and potentially thwarted by a US takeover of Greenland? The Russians can't be pleased. Right? Wrong. In an astonishing article, the Russian government paper is full of praise for Trump and critical of European leaders who oppose a US annexation of Greenland. "Standing in the way of the US president's historic breakthrough is the stubbornness of Copenhagen and the mock solidarity of intransigent European countries, including so-called friends of America, Britain and France," writes Rossiyskaya Gazeta. "Europe does not need the American greatness that Trump is promoting. Brussels is counting on 'drowning' the US president in the midterm congressional elections, on preventing him from concluding the greatest deal of his life." "Greatest deal"? The reporter explains what he means. I have to keep reminding myself I am reading the Russian government newspaper, not a pro-Trump publication in America. "If Trump annexes Greenland by July 4 2026, when America celebrates the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, he will go down in history as a figure who asserted the greatness of the United States," writes Rossiyskaya Gazeta. "With Greenland, the US becomes the second largest country in the world after Russia, surpassing Canada in area. For Americans, that's on par with such planetary events as the abolition of slavery by Abraham Lincoln in 1862 or the territorial conquests of the Napoleonic Wars. "If, thanks to Trump, Greenland becomes part of America…for sure the American people will not forget such an achievement." And the Russian reporter has this message for America's president: don't U-turn. "It is dangerous for the American president to back down over Greenland. This would weaken the position of the Republican Party in the midterm elections and likely result in a Democrat majority on Capitol Hill with the ensuing consequences for Trump. Whereas a rapid annexation of Greenland before the elections can change this political trend." In other words, it's in Trump's interest to push ahead with his plans to take over Greenland: according to the Russian government paper. Let that sink in. But why the praise from Moscow? Why the apparent encouragement? It's because Russia has much to gain from the current situation. Trump's fixation with Greenland, his determination to take over the island and impose tariffs on European countries that oppose his plan have put a huge strain on the transatlantic alliance: both on America's relations with Europe, and within Nato. Anything that weakens – or threatens to split – the Western alliance is viewed by Moscow as a huge positive for Russia. "Europe is at a total loss and, to be honest, it's a pleasure to watch this," gloated the Russian tabloid Moskovsky Komsomolets in one of its articles about Greenland. What's more, American threats to annex Greenland are being used by pro-Kremlin commentators to try to justify Russia's war on Ukraine. Victory in Ukraine remains the Kremlin's priority. Moscow believes that maintaining a positive relationship with the Trump administration will help achieve this. Hence Russia's criticism of Europe. But not of Donald Trump.

What we know about Spain's worst rail disaster in over a decade At least 40 people have died and dozens more have been injured after two high-speed trains collided in southern Spain, local authorities have said. The incident near the city of Córdoba has been described by local officials as Spain's worst rail crash in more than a decade. Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez visited the scene on Monday, where he announced a three-day mourning period. Here's what we know about the incident so far. Where did the crash happen? The crash occurred at around 19:45 local time (18:45 GMT) on Sunday, about an hour after one of the trains departed Málaga for Madrid. The train derailed and crossed over to the opposite track, operator Adif said. It then collided with an oncoming train travelling from south Madrid to Huelva, which was forced into an embankment running alongside the track, Spain's Transport Minister Óscar Puente said on Sunday. The majority of those killed and injured were in the front carriages of the Huelva-bound train, he added. What caused the crash? What caused the train to derail remains unclear. Officials say an investigation has been launched but it is not expected to determine what happened for at least a month. Puente has described the crash as "extremely strange" and said all the railway experts consulted by the government "are extremely baffled by the accident". The president of Spain's state-owned rail operator, Renfe, said he had "discarded" the possibility that the incident occured due to excessive speed or human error. Álvaro Fernández Heredia told Spain's national radio RNE that even if a mistake had been made, a system within the train would have fixed it. He added that both trains were travelling under the maximum speed limit on the stretch of track where the crash happened. Fernández Heredia suggested a mechanical fault or an infrastructure issue was a more likely cause. Meanwhile, at a news conference during his visit to Adamuz, Prime Minister Sánchez vowed to uncover the cause of the crash and thanked emergency workers for their help "in a moment of such pain and tragedy". Are people still trapped in the trains? There were around 400 passengers and staff on the two trains, operated by Iryo and Renfe, according to a statement from Renfe. It is not clear if there are people still trapped inside the carriages but rescue teams are on site. "The problem is that the carriages are twisted, so the metal is twisted with the people inside," Francisco Carmona, head of firefighters in Córdoba, told Spanish public broadcaster RTVE. "We have even had to remove a dead person to be able to reach someone alive. It is hard, tricky work," he added. The president of the Andalusian regional government, Juanma Moreno, told local outlet Canal Sur that they are waiting for "heavy machinery" to "practically lift" parts of the second train, which "has taken the worst part of this accident". "Until the heavy machinery can do its job and free the wagons from the track", emergency services will not be able to start "searching and identifying" any remaining victims, he added. Who are the victims? The 39 victims of the crash have not yet been identified, with Puente saying the death toll "is not yet final" as investigations into the crash commence. As of Monday afternoon, 122 people had received medical assistance, 48 of whom remained hospitalised, local emergency services said. Among the 48 victims still in hospital, five are under the age of 18. Moreno said teams are working to identify those who have died. What have the survivors said? Passengers on board the Madrid-bound train described the moment of impact feeling like an "earthquake" and said it shattered the train's windows, displaced luggage and threw people to the floor. "I was in the first carriage. There was a moment when it felt like an earthquake and the train had indeed derailed," journalist Salvador Jimenez told Canal Sur. "There were people screaming, calling for doctors," he added. Another passenger, Lucas Meriako, told Spanish broadcaster La Sexta Noticias he was in the fifth carriage of the same train when he started to "feel some banging" that got louder and louder. "Another train passed us and everything started vibrating. There was a jolt behind us and the feeling that the whole train was going to fall apart," he described.

**Excerpt**

Greenland 'will stay Greenland', former Trump adviser declares Donald Trump will not be able to force Greenland to change ownership, a former top adviser to the US president has told the BBC. IBM's vice chairman Gary Cohn, who advised Trump on the economy in his first term, said "Greenland will stay Greenland" and linked the need for access to critical minerals to his former boss's plans for the territory. Cohn is one of America's top tech bosses, a leader in the race to develop AI and quantum computing, and served under Trump as director of the White House National Economic Council. In a sign of how seriously business leaders are taking the crisis, he warned "invading an independent country that is part of Nato" would be "over the edge". He also suggested the president's recent comments about Greenland "may be part of a negotiation". "I just came from a US congressional delegation meeting, and I think there's pretty uniform consensus with both Republicans and Democrats that Greenland will stay Greenland", he said. Greenland would be happy for the US to increase its military presence on the island, he said, with the North Atlantic and Arctic Ocean "becoming much more of a military threat". The US could also negotiate an "offtake" agreement for Greenland's vast yet largely untapped supplies of rare earth minerals, Cohn suggested. "But I think, you know, invading a country that doesn't want to be invaded – that's part of a militaristic alliance, Nato – seems to me to be a little bit over the edge at this point", he said. Cohn indicated the president may be overstating his demands as part of a negotiating tactic – something he says the president has done successfully in the past. "You've got to give Donald Trump some credit for the successes he's had and he's many times tried to overreach to get something in a compromise situation," he said. "He has overreached in advertising something to end up getting what he actually wants. Maybe what he actually wants is a larger military presence and an offtake." The start of this year's World Economic Forum in the Swiss ski resort of Davos has been overshadowed by the president's increasingly aggressive stance on the arctic territory, with many political and business leaders alarmed about the potential geopolitical and economic impact. Trump is due to address delegates at the gathering on Wednesday. While Cohn expressed reservations about some of the president's actions, he said the US administration had "various different motives" for what they were doing. He said Trump's decision to intervene in Venezuela was "a path" to disrupt the country's relationship with China, the biggest market for its oil, as well as Russia and Cuba. Cohn also thinks that the president has become increasingly focused on the importance of rare earth minerals, noting that "Greenland has quite a supply" of the resources. Those minerals are critical to the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and quantum computing – also a major talking point in Davos. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Monday hit back at claims Trump has blamed his escalating threats over Greenland on the fact he was not awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. In a message to Norway's Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre, Trump blamed the country for not giving him the prize and said he no longer feels obliged to think only of peace. Bessent said: "I don't know anything about the president's letter to Norway, and I think it's complete canard that the President will be doing this because of the Nobel Prize. "The president is looking at Greenland as a strategic asset for the United States. We are not going to outsource our hemispheric security to anyone else." AI 'to be part of every business' Developments in quantum computing and AI are seen as critical not just for the US economy and productivity, but for US strategic influence in the world. "IBM is dead centre in what's going on in quantum today. We have the largest amount of quantum computers in use today" Cohn said, highlighting that his company has put many of these computers into use across America in firms from the banking industry to medicine. "AI is going to be the backbone for data that feeds into quantum to solve problems we've never been able to solve", he added. "Where we're heading is AI is going to be part of everyone's enterprise. AI and quantum are going to be working in the enterprise behind the scenes to make every company more efficient. And we're just at the beginning of that sort of long road, and that's going to take probably another three to five years to get there." Earlier this month, Google, also a US company, told the BBC it had the world's best-performing quantum computer. The race to develop the technology is the other key talking point – apart from Greenland – at the World Economic Forum.

**Excerpt**

Lawyers for Swiss bar owners condemn 'vindictiveness' after deadly fire The lawyers of the owners of a Swiss bar where a deadly fire broke out on New Year's Eve killing 40 people and injuring 116 have broken their silence to criticise "lies" about their clients. Jessica and Jacques Moretti were "devastated", the lawyers told local media, but denied being aware of any dangers at their venue. "There is a sort of public vindictiveness directed against them," one of the three lawyers, Yaël Hayat, said. Initial findings from the investigation suggest the fire began as sparklers attached to champagne bottles ignited soundproof foaming that lined the ceiling of the basement of Le Constellation bar in the popular ski resort of Crans-Montana. Authorities have acknowledged that the bar had not undergone safety checks for five years. Most of the victims of the fire were young - eight were under the age of 16 - and many are being treated in hospital for severe burns. Many stories about the couple, the venue they managed, as well as their past have circulated in the local media since the fire, increasing pressure on the authorities as they investigate the accident and prosecute the owners. In an interview with Tribune de Geneve, the lawyers said the couple wanted to "restore the truth". Hayat said reports her client Jessica had left the burning building with cash from the register were a lie, telling BFMTV: "In no way did she leave the scene in a hurry; she stayed there to help and support the injured." Patrick Michod, representing Jacques Moretti, said: "When you run an establishment and a tragedy like this occurs, you feel responsible. Now, the major question in this case is the question of criminal responsibility, which is obviously not the same thing as the feelings one may have as the operator." Asked about the foam in the ceiling, Michod said his client obtained the material from a "major construction retailer" which did not disclose that it was flammable. "He did not want to install a highly flammable foam. He wanted to install acoustic foam," he said. Lawyers representing the family of Cyane Panine, a staff member at Le Constellation who died in the blaze, said she had received no safety training and was unaware of the danger posed by the ceiling that caught fire. Hayat described Panine as a close friend of the couple, and pulled out a postcard she said had been written by her to the Morettis, Tribune de Geneve reported. "I hope I will continue to grow alongside you and that we will spend many more New Year's Eves together [...] you are like my second family," the postcard said. The Moretti couple have been accused by authorities of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence. Last week, a Swiss court imposed a travel ban on Jessica Moretti as an alternative to pre-trial detention. She has had to surrender her passport and must report to police every day. She previously told reporters that she was sorry about the "unthinkable tragedy". Jacques Moretti is being held in custody for an initial period of 90 days. Prosecutors have also argued the couple present a flight risk and have asked judges to impose a 400,000-franc bail ($500,000; £374,000)as a condition for their release - 200,000 for each. Michod said that he had filed a request to release Jacques Moretti.

Clashes reported after Syria and Kurdish-led forces agree ceasefire Syria's army and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) militia alliance have reported fresh clashes in the country's north-east, a day after a ceasefire deal brought much of the autonomous region under government control. The 14-point agreement signed on Sunday, which will see the SDF withdraw from Raqqa and Deir al-Zour provinces and then be integrated into state institutions, was supposed to end almost two weeks of fighting. President Ahmed al-Sharaa said he hoped it would allow Syria to "end its state of division and move to a state of unity and progress". SDF commander Mazlum Abdi said the fighting had been "imposed on us" and that he had accepted the deal "to stop the bloodshed". Abdi added that he would explain the terms after returning from Damascus, where he was expected to fly on Monday for talks on implementation. It appears to be a major blow for the SDF, which had been reluctant to give up the autonomy it won for Syria's Kurdish minority when helping US-led forces defeat the jihadist group Islamic State (IS) during the country's 13-year civil war. Sharaa has vowed to reunify Syria since he led the rebel offensive that overthrew Bashar al-Assad in December 2024, but the country remains deeply divided and has been rocked by several waves of deadly sectarian violence. On Monday, Syrian government forces advanced deep into northern and eastern areas previously controlled by the SDF. In the afternoon, the army announced that it had entered Shaddadi, in Hassakeh province, following what it alleged was the SDF's decision to release a number of detained IS members from the town's prison, according to state news agency Sana. The army said it had contacted mediators and the SDF to discuss an organised handover of the prison, but that the SDF's leadership had "refused". Soldiers would not take the necessary measures to restore security and apprehend the escapees, it added. The SDF said Shaddadi prison had "fallen outside the control of our forces" following repeated attacks by "factions affiliated with Damascus" since the early hours of the day. Dozens of SDF fighters had been killed as they tried "to prevent a serious security catastrophe", it added. The SDF also reported that clashes were continuing around another prison holding IS members, al-Aqtan in Raqqa, where it said nine of its fighters had been killed. Earlier, the army said three soldiers had been killed in two attacks by "terrorist groups" in the north-eastern Jazira region. It alleged that members of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which fought for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey for decades and has a long-running association with the SDF, were attempting to disrupt the ceasefire and "remnants of the former regime". The interior ministry also said its forces had begun deploying to Deir al-Zour province as "part of a broader security plan aimed at protecting civilians and property". Dozens of government military vehicles were seen crossing a bridge to the eastern bank of the River Euphrates along with cars, lorries and motorcycles. Safia Keddo, a 49-year-old teacher who was making her way on foot, told AFP news agency: "The past few years have been very difficult... Today we must turn the page". "We want children to return to school without fear, and for electricity, water, and bread to be restored. We're not asking for a miracle; we just want stability and a normal life." On Sunday evening, the government and SDF agreed an immediate ceasefire on all fronts across the country, which the president hailed as a "victory for all Syrians". "The Syrian state is unified and centralised in decision-making, and its institutions will enter all Syrian territories and manage all regional affairs," Sharaa told a news conference, according to Sana. "In areas with special characteristics, security personnel will be appointed from local residents." He also urged Arab tribes living in Raqqa and Deir al-Zour to "maintain calm and allow the implementation of the agreement". Before he left for Damascus, the SDF's commander said it had accepted a ceasefire agreement following an "intense war" in which many of its fighters had been killed or wounded since 6 January. "This war was imposed on us. We wanted to prevent it, but unfortunately, because it was planned by many forces, it was imposed on us," Abdi said in a statement on Kurdish TV. According to Sana, the deal stipulates that the SDF will immediately hand over administrative and military control of Deir al-Zour and Raqqa provinces to the government, including all civilian institutions and facilities. It says the government will take control of all border crossings, oil and gas fields, and prisons and camps where captured IS fighters and their family members and other affiliated civilians are detained. It also says that the SDF's military and security forces will withdraw to Hassakeh province, where they will be fully integrated into the ministries of defence and interior "on an 'individual' basis" - not as separate Kurdish units, as the SDF had demanded. The agreement also welcomes a decree issued by the president on Friday which recognised Syrian Kurds as an "integral and original" component of the Syrian people. The decree affirmed their cultural, linguistic and civil rights, including designating Kurdish as a national language, which will allow its teaching at schools in Kurdish-majority areas, granting Syrian nationality to stateless Kurds, and declaring the Nowruz spring festival as a paid national holiday. The agreement also commits the SDF to expelling all non-Syrian members of the PKK and reaffirms Syria's participation in the US-led coalition against IS. US special envoy Tom Barrack said the deal represented "a pivotal inflection point, where former adversaries embrace partnership over division". "The challenging work of finalising the details of a comprehensive integration agreement begins now, and the United States stands firmly behind this process at every stage - as we safeguard our vital national security interests in defeating [IS] remnants and advance President Trump's bold Middle East Peace Plan," he added. The agreement followed months of stalled negotiations over a March 2025 integration deal, which both sides had accused each other of trying to derail. Sharaa said last week it was unacceptable for a militia to control a quarter of the country and hold its main oil and commodities resources.

Hiring woes and 'super high' prices: Voters say Trump's progress on the US economy is mixed When campaigning to become president for the second time, Donald Trump made improving the economy a central part of his pitch to voters. One year after returning to the White House, we asked voters about that promise. What do they think of the state of the economy? Are their lives better today than they were a year ago? People from across the US and the political spectrum told the BBC about setting food budgets, applying for jobs and more. Here is what some of them had to say. Mary Anne Dagata, 72, Michigan This Michigander, a Republican, has seen the prices of basic food items fall in her rural area since Trump returned to the White House. At the beginning of the year, things were a lot tougher. Gas was really, really bad and then we had problems with getting food trucked in because I live in a rural area, so prices shot up real crazy. Where other people were complaining about $7 (£5.23) eggs, we had $11 (£8.22) eggs. Some days it was like deciding whether the dogs ate or I ate. I'm on social security and I have a budget and I'm allowed food stamps, but I only get $24 a month and that doesn't buy a whole lot. It's much better now, it's like night and day. We're aiming in a better place these days, things have completely come around from where we were a year ago. Anthony Landaeta, 33, Minnesota An independent voter, this father of an 18-month-old boy has cut down his food budget after he discovered the shockingly-steep price tag for childcare. It feels like the price of everything is rising. Childcare costs are about $25,000 per year, which really surprised me. My parents might retire next year, which could help. I work as an engineer in data centres and my wife is an airline pilot, and neither of us want to quit our job to take care of kids. It feels like Trump doesn't tell the truth about almost anything, so it's hard to know how the economy is actually doing. I'd grade him a 4 out of 10 for the economy, because he talks about it more than he actually does anything to help it. Shrinkflation drives me crazy. We bought baby formula, a 32oz bottle, and then a little later when we went to buy it again it came in a 24oz bottle. Same product, just a smaller amount for the same price. Jim Sullivan, 55, Indiana This Indiana Republican backs the president but feels he was better off in the first Trump administration than in the second... so far. I know inflation is down, allegedly down, but prices for all kinds of other things are super high, electricity, all kinds of things. I guess a lot of people wanted Trump to enforce immigration, I think that's probably hurting some of the economy. There's so many things that he could be doing - that he is doing - but he's in so many places I think he just needs to focus in on a few things. He promised the economy would be the primary thing, but I don't know that it's completely been that. In comparison from what I remember from the last Trump administration, I feel like I was doing a lot better then. We still have a lot of things that [the Trump administration] is working through, so we'll see. Devynn De Velasco, 22, Nebraska This independent voter is worried about how Trump's focus on foreign policy will ultimately impact the US economy. For the first few months he'd reference the economy, but I can't tell you the last time I've seen reporters questioning Trump about the economy let alone he addresses it on his own. My husband and I are honestly worried about an economic collapse. We've been saving a lot of money - thinking of buying a house - but we have that in the back of our mind that if there is some sort of problem, we do have a full safe. Politics and the economy are very much linked, so what our president does impacts the economy. So the threats to Greenland and Denmark and these remarks about Nato has made me quite anxious. Denise Demontagnac, 21, Maryland This registered Democrat graduated from university last year, and she has not been able to find work since, despite a job market the president has touted. One year post graduation, I have not been able to find a stable job which is extremely impacting my life and my family's life as well. It's not that I haven't applied for jobs. I've applied for jobs every single day. It's the fact that people are not hiring, partially because they cannot afford to hire. You look at interviews where Trump says 'Oh, the job market has never been better, we've created more jobs than have ever been created before'. As somebody who is actually going through that [market], I don't see the data, I don't see the proof. Kai Christianson, 30, Colorado This financial consultant, an independent voter, says his finances are "marginally ahead" of this time last year, but he's worried the gains won't last. On the campaign trail, Trump consistently brought up all the problems with inflation, and his intent to tackle it very quickly. But once back in office, with this recent geopolitical activity with Iran and Venezuela, I think it has taken a back seat. But it is clearly an issue for most Americans, and because of that he has kept it as at least a secondary priority. I think tax breaks have helped push earnings higher for companies and the stock market is doing well because of that. I do not think the policies have created enough growth so that it overshadows the cost increases that we're seeing at the same time. I hope that the Federal Reserve retains enough autonomy to manage independently. I think utilizing the justice department to threaten the Federal Reserve is very concerning.

Goodbye gator, see you later: San Francisco mourns its beloved albino alligator Claude wasn't much of a talker, he barely moved, and never wore a costume to entice his audience - but on Sunday, hundreds gathered in San Francisco to celebrate the life and legacy of the city's beloved albino alligator. A New Orleans-style brass band, a gator-shaped eight-foot-long white sourdough bread, drag queen story time and even a street officially bearing his name, Claude the Alligator Way, the memorial was one of its kind. The reptile sure won millions of hearts when he was alive, but he was also remembered for stealing from a 12-year-old girl. The 10-foot-long, 300-pound white alligator with pink eyes and poor eyesight once stole - and then gobbled- the girl's ballet shoe, recalled Bart Shepherd of the California Academy of Sciences, Claude's home for 17 years before his death in December. "It's no small feat to get a shoe out of an alligator," Shepherd told a crowd of Claude's fans in Golden Gate Park. It took a lot of anaesthesia, specialised tools, and multiple vets and staff members to extract the shoe from inside Claude - a task that was completed successfully, despite a fire alarm going off throughout the building at the time, Shepherd said. "It was really heartening to see San Francisco come out to celebrate this beloved San Francisco icon," Jeanette Peach, the communications director at the academy, told the BBC. Part of why people loved Claude so much, Peach said, was that he "embodied something that we think of as a really San Francisco ideal, which is not just accepting but welcoming people for their differences". Claude's albinism, which is extremely rare in alligators, provided visibility for people who feel a little outcast, Peach said. "Here is this wonderful animal who is a little outcast from how the rest of his species is, but who is beloved and treasured and has value," she added. Claude "delighted and captivated more than 22 million visitors and showed us the power of ambassador animals to connect people with nature and science", the academy wrote on its website. The reptile, who died from liver cancer at the age of 30 in December, hatched in 1995 at an alligator farm in Louisiana before coming to live at the academy's swamp exhibit in 2008. Since his passing, the academy has received thousands of letters from Claude's fans, writing to say how much the alligator meant to them. "Thank you for inspiring so many young children over the years," one of Claude's visitors wrote in a note to him. "You reminded us that our differences are what make us unique and special and that they are something to be celebrated." "You will forever be in my heart," another wrote. "I will miss you so much and thank you for being a part of my childhood." Lana Krol, a senior veterinarian at the academy, said that out of all the alligators she's worked with, Claude "struck me as the most laidback of them all". "I can say with confidence that I won't meet another gator like Claude in my lifetime. I'll miss him terribly," Krol said.

### 12. [Nigeria remembers master wood carver](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgqelez1kwwo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

Nigeria remembers master wood carver Renowned Nigerian master wood carver Kasali Akangbe Ogun has been buried following his death last week after a brief illness. He came from a long line of wood carvers from the Yoruba people, and took the tradition from his birthplace of Osogbo in the country's south-west to the global art space. Akangbe Ogun was famous for his "unique artistic style, characterised by lean, elongated faces and dynamic, flowing forms", noted Nigerian art patron Olufemi Akinsanya. He was one of the leading lights of the New Sacred Art Movement, founded by the late Austrian-Nigerian artist and Yoruba priestess, Susanne Wenger, in the 1960s, to help protect the 75-hectare Osun Forest and its river. "We will continue to plant trees because heritage must not be left naked," Akangbe Ogun told me when I visited him in 2020. The grove, on the outskirts of Osogbo city, was designated a Unesco World Heritage Site in 2005 for its cultural significance in the cosmology of the Yoruba, and as the largest protected high primary forest in the region. "Regarded as the abode of the goddess of fertility Osun, one of the pantheon of Yoruba gods, the landscape of the grove and its meandering river is dotted with sanctuaries and shrines, sculptures and art works in honour of Osun and other deities," Unesco says on its website. "The sacred grove, which is now seen as a symbol of identity for all Yoruba people, is probably the last in Yoruba culture," it adds. Works from The New Sacred Art Movement are currently on show in the landmark Nigerian Modernism exhibition at Tate Modern. "Kasali Akangbe Ogun was a vital figure within the New Sacred Art Movement, whose work brought spiritual depth to Yoruba devotional practice," exhibition curator Osei Bonsu said. His art "stands as a testament to a life committed to faith, community, and visual poetry", he added. Akangbe Ogun was one of those helping to safeguard the forest from misuse, even confronting and getting into scrapes with those trying to fish in the sacred River Osun, where such activities were prohibited, to preserve the pristine environment. The river is the focus of the annual Osun Osogbo Festival, which attracts thousands of worshippers and spectators and is one of the biggest tourism draws in Nigeria. According to historian Siyan Oyeweso, Osogbo "has always played a very, very active role in the making of the art masters. Those were the people who sacrificed their lives and time, [and] gave devotion, energy and soul to the mission of Osun Osogbo and Nigeria." Akangbe Ogun was one of those people. His actual date of birth appears to be unknown, but he was born around 1945 into the Arelagbayi lineage. Wood carving was a family tradition, but by the time of Akangbe Ogun's birth, it had skipped two generations. At the very start of primary school, his education was truncated by his father's death. He eventually started learning carpentry. Akangbe Ogun reflected later in life: "I only spent one week in school, but I lecture university students in the US. I am good at picking up languages. I have travelled a lot, and it's all thanks to art." He was working in the grove, on the Iledi Ontooto shrine roof, when Susanne Wenger, the Austrian-Nigerian artist and Yoruba priestess, said to him: "It is wood carving you'll be doing." She told him his work was distinctive, different - and he held on to that to the end of his days. As Wenger wrote in 1990: "Akangbe, bodily and spiritually voluminous, creates works of an ethereal, sublimely weightless loftiness. His work is a primary eruption of genius." Speaking on behalf of the Adunni Olorisha Trust, Akinsanya said the carver's "craftsmanship is visible in the ritual figures, majestic pillars, and beautifully crafted roofs adorning many of the shrines". Akangbe Ogun exhibited widely, including at: Iwalewa Haus, Bayreuth, Germany (1989); Africa Centre, London (1990); Edinburgh Fringe (1994); and in the New Sacred Art Movement show at Quintessence, Lagos (2009). He exhibited – and executed commissions – at the National Black Theatre in Harlem in the US, all through the 1990s, working with the theatre's founder, Barbara Ann Teer. At the invitation of historian Akinwunmi Ogundiran, the carver was Distinguished Africana Artist-in-Residence at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, US, in 2013. Ogundiran wrote that Akangbe Ogun's works "transcend the traditional boundaries of sculpture, structural design, folklore, and environmental preservation". In his tribute, curator and art consultant Moses Ohiomokhare said: "I mourn the loss of this great artist, a master wood carver and an extraordinary person. We did exhibit him at Quintessence, and we worked together. He left an indelible mark on Yoruba cultural heritage. His art should be remembered by the world." Alluding to the poetic lines, sense of whimsy and wit in the artist's works, Ohiomokhare noted that Akangbe Ogun did "both small and big works, but those small ones were representational of what he was capable of doing". Carvings – especially of the traditional, sacred kind – aren't usually as famous as paintings and other pieces of contemporary art. The proof of Akangbe Ogun's pudding, as it were, is writ large in the monumental sculptures, structures in fantastical formations that attest to his mastery of his art, on view all over the Osun Grove. Smaller pieces such as his Wooden Rocking Horse have pride of place in Wenger's home in Osogbo, a fine piece of Brazilian architecture maintained by the Adunni Olorisha Trust. Whatever the level of his renown, Akangbe Ogun lived as a simple man, among the ordinary people in Osogbo. More than anything, he wanted to maintain his living environment as a model of the traditional Yoruba setting, a place for people to come and learn about the old ways. Reflecting on his career in October 2020, Akangbe Ogun said: "What pleases me the most is that my children have learned the wood carving art, they have inherited the legacy. The work will live on through my children." Akangbe Ogun featured last year in a short film by The Metropolitan Museum of Art in the US, commemorating the reopening of its Michael C. Rockefeller Wing housing the Arts of Africa. It is a measure of the artist's wide-ranging influence that one of those paying tributes was Wayne Barrow, manager of the American Hip-Hop legend, The Notorious B.I.G. "You have lived in strength, resolute in sharing your gifts with the world, fearlessly carving a legacy etched in wood touched by your hands," Wayne wrote in a post on Instagram. Arguably, Akangbe Ogun himself put it best when he said: "I am a dot, just a dot, connecting the past to the present, and the future."
