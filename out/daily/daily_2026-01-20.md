Spain train crash recovery continues as investigators probe 'gap' in rail Heavy machinery is being used to assist in the recovery following a two-train crash in southern Spain which killed at least 41 people. Rescuers worked through a second night and said the death toll included three bodies still trapped in a wrecked carriage. More than 120 people were injured when carriages on a Madrid-bound train derailed and crossed over to the opposite tracks, hitting an oncoming train in Adamuz on Sunday evening. Sabotage has been ruled out, the interior minister has said, and the initial focus of investigators is on a broken rail on the high-speed line. Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has cancelled his planned trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos, pledging to get to the bottom of Spain's worst train disaster in more than a decade. Spain's King Felipe and Queen Letizia visited the site on Tuesday, shaking hands and speaking to emergency service workers near the site of the crash on the first of three days of national mourning. Transport Minister Óscar Puente said the death toll "is not yet final", and officials are working to identify the dead. Puente said the investigation could take at least a month, describing the incident as "extremely strange". Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska ruled out sabotage, telling reporters that it "was never considered", and he stressed that all hypotheses remained open. Óscar Puente warned against speculation and said a lot of cracks had been found on the track but investigators would have to determine whether they had caused the derailment or had been caused by it. A 30cm gap in one of the rails is the current focus of the investigation, according to Spanish reports. Technicians told El Mundo newspaper that a "bad" or "deteriorated" weld was "more than likely" the cause for the derailment. Ignacio Barron, head of Spain's Commission of Investigation of Rail Accidents (CIAF), said on RTVE: "What always plays a part in a derailment is the interaction between the track and the vehicle, and that is what the commission is currently [looking into]." On Monday, Renfe President Álvaro Fernández Heredia apparently ruled out "human error", telling RNE programme Las Mañanas that, if "the driver makes a mistake, the system itself corrects it". Heredia also told RNE that both trains were travelling under the maximum speed limit on the stretch of track where the crash happened. Spanish police are looking at the first carriage of the Iryo train that left the track at Adamuz. As the investigation into the crash continues, Spanish media reported that train drivers warned about the state of the Madrid-Andalusia line in August and requested a speed limit of under 250km/h (155 mph). In a letter to the state-owned rail infrastructure administrator, Adif, the drivers union reportedly said the increase in the number and weight of high-speed trains was causing a greater number of failures. Four hundred passengers and staff were on board the two trains, the rail authorities said. Emergency services treated 122 people, with 41, including children, still in hospital. Of those, 12 are in intensive care. Most of those killed and injured were in the front carriages of the Huelva-bound train, officials said. Salvador Jimenez, a journalist with RTVE who was on one of the trains, said the impact felt like an "earthquake". "I was in the first carriage. There was a moment when it felt like an earthquake and the train had indeed derailed," Jimenez said. Video from the scene appears to show some train carriages had tipped over on their sides. Rescue workers can be seen scaling the train to pull people out of the lopsided train doors and windows. A Madrid-bound passenger, José, told public broadcaster Canal Sur: "There were people and screaming, calling for doctors." Rail network operator Adif said the collision happened at 19:45 local time (18:45 GMT) on Sunday, about an hour after one of the trains left Málaga heading north to Madrid, when it derailed on a straight stretch of track near the city of Córdoba. The force of the crash pushed the carriages of the second train into an embankment, according to the transport minister. All high-speed services between Madrid and the southern cities of Malaga, Cordoba, Sevilla and Huelva have been suspended until Friday.

Palestinian children's football pitch faces Israeli demolition ultimatum A Palestinian children's football club in the occupied West Bank faces imminent demolition despite an international campaign to save it. Its supporters say it provides a rare sporting opportunity for young Palestinian players. But Israel insists it's been built without the necessary permits. In this deeply divided land so much is contested; from the identities and faiths of the people who live here, to every inch of the ground they stand on. Recently, that has come to include one small patch of artificial turf laid down under the shadow of the giant concrete wall that isolates Israel from much of the occupied West Bank. In the context of the 7 October attacks, the two-year war in Gaza and the fragility of the current ceasefire, there are without doubt far more pressing issues. But this is a story freighted with symbolism and one which has drawn outsized international attention because of its connection to that other world religion - football. On the day we visit, a group of Palestinian children are lining up to take penalty shots in the winter sunshine. The construction of the pitch began here on the edge of Bethlehem in 2020, and today it provides a place to practise for more than 200 young players from the nearby Aida refugee camp. The cramped and crowded streets contain the homes of the descendants of Palestinian families who were forced or who fled from their homes during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. On 3 November last year, as the children made their short walk from the camp for that day's training, they found a notice pinned to the gate of the football field declaring it to be illegal. The notice was followed soon by a demolition order. "We don't have anywhere else to play," 10-year-old Naya told me, wearing a Brazil shirt with the name of the footballing legend Neymar emblazoned on the back. "We are building our dreams here," she said. "If they demolish our field, they will demolish our dreams." I asked another young player, Mohammed, what his reaction was when he heard the news that the club was earmarked for destruction. "I was upset," he told me. "This is a field I really care for." The community has fought back, posting videos on social media, launching a petition attracting hundreds of thousands of signatures, and receiving messages of international support. The club says that after representations from a lawyer it was recently given a seven-day reprieve. But that extension expired on Monday, leaving it with a difficult choice. As is common practice in such cases, the club owners must either demolish the pitch themselves or wait for the Israeli authorities to do it forcibly, after which they'll be presented with the bill. The looming presence of the wall, which runs along the length of one of the touchlines, is just one of the many complex layers that underpin the Israeli occupation of the territory that Palestinians want as the basis for a future state. Militarily, Israel exerts control over the entirety of the West Bank. But administrative control – its day-to-day governance – is divided between a patchwork of Palestinian-run areas and Israeli-run ones. The maps on which those distinctions are based were drawn up as a key part of the Oslo Accords, signed in the 1990s by Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO). The West Bank was split into three categories of territory. Areas A and B were pockets of land over which the Palestinian Authority was given civil control. In those marked as Area A, Palestinians were also given nominal security control. Area C – more than 60% of the total – was to remain temporarily under full Israeli control. The idea was that it would eventually be gradually transferred to Palestinian self-rule as the negotiations continued. While that never happened, with both sides blaming each other for the failure of the peace process, the maps remain the basis for much of how the West Bank is governed today. Bethlehem itself is designated as Area A. But the maps show Israel exercising Area C civil authority over much of the surrounding countryside, right up the city's edge. Israel began building its concrete barrier in the early 2000s in the face of a wave of deadly suicide bombings and other attacks carried out by Palestinians which killed hundreds of Israelis. Critics claim that today, as it has grown in length, the wall has become a tool for punishing many thousands of ordinary Palestinians, separating them from their workplaces, dividing their communities and effectively annexing parts of their land. But what's now in contention in Bethlehem is a tiny, narrow patch of ground on the Palestinian side of the wall. For the residents of the Aida camp looking for space to build a football field, it was just large enough to accommodate their needs. But for Israel it remains – and is marked on the maps – as part of Area C, even though the construction of the wall has left it marooned on the Bethlehem side. Satellite photos show that the space was vacant in 2019 and then, year by year, the pitch can be seen beginning to take shape, fitting in snuggly right up against the wall. The demolition order argues that it was built without the necessary permissions on a plot of land over which Israel still asserts full civil control. For Palestinians, there is no small irony in the fact that they're being denied the right to build a small football pitch on the boundary of their city, inside the wall that fences them in. While turning down permission for their buildings and demolishing existing ones, Israel continues to approve the construction of vast new Israeli settlements across Area C, which are considered illegal under international law. Last September, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signed an agreement to push ahead with a major and highly controversial settlement that will house 20,000 Israelis. Located between occupied East Jerusalem and the already existing settlement of Maale Adumim, if completed it would effectively cut the West Bank in half which, Palestinians say, will all but destroy their aspirations for nationhood. The Israeli government agrees. "There will be no Palestinian state," Netanyahu said at the signing ceremony. "This place belongs to us." Some of his ministers speak openly of the full annexation of the West Bank. In Bethlehem, the football club – which claims it did receive verbal permission in 2020 for the pitch – believes the threat of demolition is about far more than planning law. "The Israelis don't want us to have any kind of hope, they don't want us to have any opportunity," Mohammad Abu Srour, one of the board members of the Aida Youth Centre, told me. The idea, he suggested, was to make life deliberately hard. "The moment that we lose hope and opportunity we are going to leave. This is the only explanation for us." We approached the Israeli body that manages civilian affairs in the West Bank for comment. Although the demolition order was issued on its behalf, we were referred instead to the Israeli military, which oversees its work. The IDF gave us the following statement. "Along the security fence, there is a confiscation order and a prohibition on construction; therefore, the construction in the area was carried out unlawfully," it said. As they wait to see what happens next, the children of Aida hope that the international attention might be enough to sway the authorities' minds. But for now, as the wider conflict grinds on, the future of one small football pitch is hanging in the balance.

Anthony Joshua's driver appears in court after crash that killed two A chauffer who was driving Anthony Joshua when their car crashed killing two of the boxer's friends has appeared in a court in Nigeria. Adeniyi Kayode, 46, was previously charged with four crimes, including death by dangerous driving. Joshua's personal trainer, Latif Ayodele, and strength coach, Sina Ghami, died on 29 December after their vehicle collided with a stationary lorry near Lagos. Joshua was treated in hospital for his injuries. Kayode arrived at Sagamu Magistrates Court in Ogun state on Tuesday, but the case was adjourned until the 25 February after the prosecutor was granted more time to gain legal advice. Kayode faced the court wearing a black hoodie, black shoes and a pair of black trousers. He did not speak during the hearing. He was previously released from custody after being granted bail of 5m naira Naira ($3,500; £2,600). Joshua, a former heavyweight champion, was discharged from hospital two days after the Lexus SUV crashed on the busy Lagos-Ibadan expressway, in south-west Nigeria. Ghami and Ayodele were both pronounced dead at the scene, while 36-year-old Joshua was pictured being helped from the wreckage. Following the crash, the boxer posted a tribute to Ghami and Ayodele on Instagram, writing: "I didn't even realise how special they are. "I'll just be walking with them and cracking jokes with them, not even knowing God kept me in the presence of great men. "100% it's tough for me, but I know it's even tougher for their parents." Joshua, who was born in Watford, has family roots in Sagamu - a town in Ogun state, near the crash site. He was on his way to visit relatives for New Year celebrations in the town at the time of the crash, a family member told the BBC. Kayode has been charged with causing death by dangerous driving, reckless and negligent driving, driving without due care, and driving without a valid driver's licence.

Bobi Wine tells the BBC from hiding he will not contest Uganda election results in court Uganda's opposition leader Bobi Wine has told the BBC he will not contest the results of Thursday's election in court, citing a lack of confidence in the judiciary and has instead urged his supporters to take to the streets to peacefully protest. Speaking to the BBC from hiding, he said he would continue to stand up to President Yoweri Museveni despite concerns for his safety. "The judiciary in Uganda is captured and we encourage Ugandans to use any legal means to fight back and protect their democracy," the 43-year-old former pop star said. Museveni, 81, won the vote by a landslide and has accused the opposition of seeking to overturn the results through violence, calling them "terrorists". He gained 72% of the vote while Wine, his closest challenger, got 25%. Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, maintains the results are "fake" and has cited "ballot stuffing" without providing any details. During his interview, Wine also hit out at the security forces for not allowing food into his family home where his wife and relatives are effectively under house arrest. He says he fled the house, in a suburb of the capital, Kampala, on Friday night during a raid by the security forces. "We reject those results because they are fake and they don't in any way reflect the voting pattern. They are completely different from the results in the electoral on the polling stations and on the declaration forms," Wine told the BBC, speaking from an undisclosed location. The authorities have not responded to his allegations, but the Uganda Human Rights Commission (UHRC) said the "technical and procedural" challenges observed on polling day did not undermine the overall fairness of the vote. In their report, the African Union (AU) election observers said they saw "no evidence of ballot stuffing", but condemned days-long internet shutdown - which only returned hours after President Museveni was declared the winner on Saturday. After losing to Museveni in 2021, Wine challenged the results but later withdrew the petition, citing what he called the court's bias and lack of impartiality. Wine, who has lost his presidential bid for a second time, also alleged there was an ongoing "silent massacre" as political activists were targeted in a crackdown. In a social media post he said more than 100 people had been killed in election violence - without stating evidence. More than 100 youths have been remanded in prison on various charges linked to election-related incidents across Kampala, the Daily Monitor newspaper reported. In a post on X on Monday, Uganda's army chief Gen Muhoozi Kainerugaba, who is also President Museveni's son and his potential successor, said the security forces had killed 22 opposition supporters during poll-related violence. Gen Kainerugaba also threatened Wine, giving him "exactly 48 hours to surrender himself to the police". "If he doesn't we will treat him as an outlaw/rebel and handle him accordingly," he said. In his BBC interview, Wine said he fled his home after learning that security forces were planning to "attack" him. "They jumped off my fence and cut off my electricity and the surveillance cameras. I saw it dangerous for me to stay around," said Wine, who has not been seen in public for days. "You have heard Museveni's son promising to harm me. He has promised to harm people and... he has delivered to it. You have read his recent tweets. That's why I have to be careful with myself," he said. Although the internet was restored late on Saturday, Wine said he was not able to reach his wife because of signal jammers near his home. The police have denied raiding the opposition leader's home, saying the security deployment was to protect him as a presidential candidate. Wine went on to call for a "peaceful change" of regime, saying protests were constitutional rights. "We encourage Ugandans to evoke any constitutional means to fight back," he added. On Tuesday, Donald Muhwezi, a local police chief in Kampala, told local media that police were not concerned about Wine's whereabouts, "as long as he is safe". In his victory speech on Sunday, Museveni said his election win showed the dominance of his party, the National Resistance Movement (NRM). Museveni first came to power as a rebel leader in 1986 but since then has won seven elections. Uganda has not witnessed a peaceful transfer of presidential power since independence.

China demands Taliban protect its citizens after deadly Kabul blast Beijing has demanded the Taliban government protect its citizens after an explosion at a Chinese restaurant in the Afghan capital Kabul killed at least seven people. Six Afghans and one Chinese national were killed, and several more injured, in the blast at a Chinese restaurant in a heavily-guarded part of the city centre on Monday, officials told the media. The jihadist group Islamic State (IS) said it was behind the attack - although police in Kabul said the "nature of the explosion is unknown so far and is being investigated". China has urged its citizens not to travel to Afghanistan, where the Taliban seized control in 2021. Islamic State has claimed numerous bombings since then. Speaking on Tuesday, Beijing's foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun added that China had "made urgent representations with the Afghan side, demanding that the Afghan side spare no effort to treat the injured, further take effective measures to protect the safety of Chinese citizens". City police spokesman Khalid Zadran said the explosion took place near the kitchen of the Chinese Noodle restaurant, which is located under a guesthouse in the capital's Shahr-e-Naw area. Dejan Panic, the Afghanistan director of humanitarian group EMERGENCY, said they received "20 people" at their hospital, seven of whom were dead on arrival. Four women and a child were also among the injured. Footage circulating on social media of the aftermath of the explosion showed a large hole torn in the side of the building, Reuters news agency said. Eyewitnesses told BBC Afghan that a car outside the restaurant had been completely destroyed, and that locals had helped rush people in "critical condition" to hospital. Large sheets were later put up to cover the damaged building. Police spokesman Zadran said the restaurant mainly served Chinese Muslims, and was run by a Chinese Muslim man from the Chinese region of Xinjiang, his wife and his Afghan business partner. In its statement, the local branch of IS said that China was on "the list" of its targets, especially given China's "increasing crimes against the oppressed Uyghur Muslims". China has been accused of committing crimes against humanity against the Uyghur population and other mostly-Muslim ethnic groups in the north-western region of Xinjiang. The Chinese government has denied all allegations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang. IS has previously said it was behind an attack on a Chinese-owned hotel in Kabul back in 2022, in which three of the attackers died and at least two other people were injured. More recently, Chinese nationals just over the border in Tajikistan have been targeted by unknown attackers. In November, six Chinese nationals were killed in three separate incidents. Beijing has told its citizens to leave the Tajik-Afghan border.

**Excerpt**

Nigeria police deny reports of mass church abductions in north Police in northern Nigeria say reports that worshippers were abducted on Sunday from churches in Kaduna state were false. In a joint statement with local government officials on Monday, Kaduna state police commissioner Alhaji Muhammad Rabiu described the information as "mere falsehood which is being peddled by conflict entrepreneurs who want to cause chaos". Earlier, a local official in Kurmin Wali had told the BBC that gunmen had kidnapped dozens of people attending different churches. There has been a series of mass kidnapping in Nigeria, where both Christians and Muslims have been targeted. Gangs frequently carry out such attacks to get ransom payments. But referring to Sunday's alleged abductions Kaduna's police commissioner challenged "anyone to list the names of the kidnapped victims and other particulars". The chairman of Kajuru local government area, Dauda Madaki, said security forces were sent to Kurmin Wali after reports of an attack, but found "no evidence of the attack. I asked the village head, Mai Dan Zaria, and he said that there was no such attack." Police also quoted the state's commissioner for internal security and home affairs saying religious leaders visited the area. ''They found out that what was pushed out to the public sphere was completely false,'' he reportedly said. However, a community leader in Kurmin Wali, Ishaku Dan'azumi Sarkin, had earlier told the BBC that armed men attacked the area on Sunday and kidnapped 177 people from three churches. He said 11 people escaped, several others were injured, and no deaths were reported. In November, more than 300 students and teachers were seized from a Catholic school. They were later released in two successive groups. It was among a spate of kidnappings that made international headlines. Nigeria is facing numerous security challenges - including kidnappings for ransom by criminal gangs, an Islamist insurgency in the north-east, separatist violence in the south-east, and a battle between herders and farmers in the centre over access to land and water. Experts say corruption, poor intelligence sharing and underfunded local policing have hampered efforts to tackle the various crises. Nigeria's defence minister resigned last month at the height of the kidnapping crisis, officially for health reasons, according to the president's office. The US has recently become militarily involved in Nigeria - launching airstrikes on Christmas Day on two camps run by an Islamist militant group in north-western Nigeria. Earlier this month, US President Donald Trump warned of more strikes if Christians continued to be killed in the West African nation. There are more than 250 ethnic groups in Nigeria, which is roughly divided into a mainly Muslim north, a largely Christian south, with intermingling in the middle - and the government says people of all faiths have been victims of attacks. A Nigerian foreign ministry spokesman responded to Trump's warning by saying that Nigeria would continue to engage constructively with partners such as the US. ''Nigeria remains committed to protecting all citizens, Christians and Muslims alike, without discrimination,'' Alkasim Abdulkadir said.

BBC visits UN compound Israel is demolishing in East Jerusalem Israeli demolition teams have begun to tear down the headquarters of the UN Palestinian Refugee Agency, known as Unrwa, in occupied East Jerusalem. Israel says it owns the land on which the compound stands and has accused Unrwa of being infiltrated by Hamas. Unrwa says its premises are protected under international conventions and, while it admits that nine Unrwa staff may have been involved in the 7 October Hamas-led attacks, it says Israel hasn't proven anything more extensive than that. The BBC's John Sudworth reports from the site.
