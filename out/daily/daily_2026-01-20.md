Lyse Doucet: Trump is shaking the world order more than any president since WW2 On day one, he put the world on notice. "Nothing will stand in our way," President Donald Trump declared, to thunderous applause, as he ended his inauguration speech in a cold Washington winter on this day last year, at the start of his second term. Did the world fail to take enough notice? Tucked into his speech was a mention of the 19th Century doctrine of "manifest destiny" – the idea that the US was divinely ordained to expand its territory across the continent, spreading American ideals. At that moment, the Panama Canal was in his sights. "We're taking it back," Trump announced. Now that same declaration, expressed with absolute resolve, is directed at Greenland. "We have to have it," is the new mantra. It's a rude awakening in a moment fraught with grave risk. US history is littered with consequential and controversial American invasions, occupations, and covert operations to topple rulers and regimes. But, in the past century, no American president has threatened to seize the land of a longtime ally and rule it against their people's will. No US leader has so brutally broken political norms and threatened long-standing alliances which have underpinned the world order since the end of World War Two. There's little doubt that old rules are being broken, with impunity. Trump is now being described as possibly the US's most "transformative" president - cheered by supporters at home and abroad, alarm among others in capitals the world over, and a watchful silence in Moscow and Beijing. "It's a shift toward a world without rules, where international law is trampled underfoot, and where the only law which seems to matter is the strongest with imperial ambitions resurfacing," was French President Emmanuel Macron's stark warning on the stage at the Davos Economic Forum, without directly mentioning Trump by name. There is mounting concern over a possible painful trade war, even worry in some circles that the 76-year-old Nato military alliance could now be at risk if, in the worst case scenario, the US commander-in-chief tries to take Greenland by force. Trump's defenders are doubling down in support of his "America First" agenda, against the post-war multilateral order. When asked on BBC Newshour whether seizing Greenland would violate the UN charter, Republican congressman Randy Fine said: "I think the United Nations has abjectly failed in being an entity that supports peace in the world and, frankly, whatever they think, probably doing the opposite's the right thing." Fine introduced a bill called "Greenland Annexation and Statehood Act" in Congress last week. How do America's anxious allies respond, when it seems nothing will stand in Trump's way? Many phrases have peppered this past year of diplomatic contortions over how best to deal with the US's unpredictable president and commander-in-chief. "We need to take him seriously but not literally," comes from those who insist this can all be sorted out through dialogue. It's worked, but only to a point, on trying to forge a united response with Europe to Russia's blistering war in Ukraine. Trump often veers, from one week to the next, from espousing positions close to Russia's, then tilting towards Ukraine, then bolting back into Russia's orbit again. "He's a real estate mogul," says those who see in Trump's maximalist positions his deal-making tactics from his New York property days. There's an echo of that in his repeated threats of military action against Iran – although it's clear military options are still on his now crowded table. He doesn't talk like a traditional politician," explains his top diplomat, the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio when he is repeatedly questioned about Trump's tactics. "He says and then he does," is his highest praise for his president against what he derides as the dismal record of previous incumbents. Rubio has been one of the principal voices trying to backpedal Trump's threats on Greenland, underlining that he wants to buy this vast strategic ice sheet, not invade it. He pointed out that Trump has been exploring options to purchase the world's largest island, to counter threats from China and Russia, since his first term in office. But there is no denying Trump's bully tactics, his contempt for collective action, his belief that might is right. "He is a man of transactions and brute power, mafia style power," says Zanny Minton Beddoes, editor-in-chief of the Economist magazine. "He doesn't see the benefit of alliances, he doesn't see the idea of America as an idea, a set of values; he doesn't give two hoots about that." And he doesn't hide it. "Nato is not feared by Russia or China at all. Not even a little bit," Trump told the New York Times in a wide-ranging interview earlier this month. "We're tremendously feared." If security was the issue, the US already has forces on the ground in Greenland and under a 1951 agreement could send in more troops and open more bases. "I need to own it," is how Trump flatly puts it. And he often makes it clear, "I like to win." There's a growing body of proof that's what it is about. His policy back flips in the past year have been baffling. In the Saudi capital Riyadh in May, we watched how his major speech on his first foreign trip of his second term met a rapturous reception. Trump took aim at the American "interventionists" whom he excoriated for having "wrecked far more nations than they built... in complex societies that they did not even understand themselves." In June when Israel attacked Iran, Trump reportedly warned Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu not to put his diplomacy at risk with his military threats against Tehran. By the end of the week, when he saw Israel's success in assassinating top nuclear scientists and security chiefs, Trump exclaimed: "I think it's been excellent." "Sane-washing" was the phrase coined months ago by Edward Luce of the Financial Times to describe the world's polite portrayals of Trump, the succession of leaders landing at his door with glittering gifts and gilded praise to try to win him over to their side. "Trump's apologists – a more numerous crowd than true believers - work round the clock to sane-wash his policies into something coherent," Luce wrote in his latest column. It was on full display last October when leaders the world over were summoned to join him at the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm El-Sheikh to celebrate his ringing declaration that "at long last we have peace in the Middle East" for the first time in "3,000 years." The first significant phase of his peace plan had brought about a desperately needed ceasefire in Gaza and the urgent release of Israeli hostages. It was Trump's muscular diplomacy that forced Netanyahu, as well as Hamas, to agree to it. It was a major breakthrough only Trump could achieve. But it wasn't – sadly - the dawn of peace. No-one there said the quiet part out loud. Last year Trump's approach was framed as manifest destiny. This year it's the early 19th Century Monroe Doctrine now updated, since the Venezuela invasion, as the "Donroe Doctrine." President Trump now owns it, bolstered by his fervent backers on his team, with his belief that America can act at will in its backyard, and beyond, to protect American interests. Sometimes he is called an isolationist, sometimes an interventionist. But there's always that slogan which returned him to power - Make America Great Again. And his letter to Norway's Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre highlighted his obsessive pique over not winning this year's Nobel Peace Prize. Trump informed Støre: "I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America." "It's a good day to have a Nordic temperament," Norway's Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide diplomatically remarked to me when I asked about this moment. Norway has been calm, with ice-hard firmness, in its defence of Greenland and Denmark and collective security in the Arctic. European responses still stretch across this slippery political ice. Macron has vowed to launch the EU's "trade bazooka" of counter-tariffs and restricting access to the EU's lucrative market. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, one of the American president's closest European allies, has vaguely spoken of a "problem of understanding and miscommunication." UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has strongly and publicly defended Greenland's territorial integrity but wants to protect the strong personal bond he's built over the past year by avoiding retaliatory tariffs. The gloves are off for Trump as he posts the private messages he's receiving from leaders using the old tools of statecraft to try to keep him on side. "Let us have a dinner in Paris together on Thursday before you go back to the US," suggested the French president who also queried, in the midst of praise for other foreign policy successes, "I do not understand what you are doing on Greenland". "Can't wait to see you", wrote Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte, who once called Trump "daddy" for his forceful handling of the Iran-Israel 12-day war last year. Rutte, and others, have credited Trump's blunt threats for forcing Nato members to significantly increase their defence spending in recent years. Trump's warnings, going back to his first term, accelerated a trend called for by previous US presidents and started by Nato members themselves in the shadow of Russian threats. On the other side of the Atlantic, the country which has long lived in America's shadow has been trying to forge a different path forward, albeit with challenges of their own. "We have to take the world as it is, not the way we want it to be," was the candid reflection of Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney on his trip to China last week. It was the first visit by a Canadian leader to Beijing since 2017, after years of sharp tension, and it sent a clear signal of this fast changing world. Trump's astonishing threat to annex his neighbour to the north surfaced again this week in a post on social media which showed the western hemisphere, including Canada and Greenland, covered in stars and stripes. Canadians know there's still a risk they could be next. Carney, the former central banker, rose to Canada's highest office last year buoyed by Canadians' belief he was the best prepared to take on Trump. He responded "dollar for dollar" from the start, imposing retaliatory tariffs – until it became too painful for the much smaller Canadian economy, which sends more than 70% of its trade south of its border. When Carney took to the stage at Davos on Tuesday, he also focused on this jarring juncture. "American hegemony in particular, helped provide public goods, open sea lanes, a stable financial system, collective security and support for frameworks for resolving disputes," he said, adding bluntly: "We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition." On Wednesday Trump will speak from that same podium with the world watching. Asked by the New York Times this month what could stop him, Trump replied: "My own morality. My own mind. It's the only thing that can stop me." That's what lies behind an armada of allies now seeking to persuade, flatter, force him – to change his mind. This time, it's not certain they will succeed.

Driver killed and several injured after train derails near Barcelona, local media report A train driver has been killed and at least 14 people injured after a commuter train derailed and crashed near Barcelona, local media report. According to local officials, the Rodalies train collided with a retaining wall which fell onto the track between Gelida and Sant Sadurní on Tuesday evening. The severity of injuries suffered by passengers is currently being assessed by emergency services. The incident occurred as heavy storms battered north-eastern Spain. Many coastal areas in the east and north-west of Spain are on high alert because of the weather. There have also been snowstorms in the Spanish Pyrenees and storms along the coast of Menorca, causing waves several metres high. Eleven ambulances were on the scene in Gelida, Catalonia - around 35km (21.7 miles) west of Barcelona - treating those injured, emergency services said. The local fire service said 35 crews had been sent to the area and one passenger trapped inside the train had been rescued. In a later update it said that no-one remained inside and that its crews were conducting a sweep of the area to rule out any further victims. Emergency services said they had evacuated some of the injured to nearby Moisès Broggi, Bellvitge, and Vila Franca hospitals. The crash in Catalonia comes two days after two high-speed trains collided in Adamuz, Andalusia, in one of the worst Spanish rail accidents in over a decade. At least 42 people are known to have died after carriages on a Madrid-bound train derailed and crossed over to the opposite tracks and then collided with an oncoming high-speed train.

UK defends Chagos deal after Trump calls it 'act of great stupidity' The UK government has defended a deal to give the Chagos Islands to Mauritius and lease back a key military base, following criticism from US President Donald Trump over its handling. In a post on social media, Trump labelled the move as an "act of great stupidity", months after he and senior US officials endorsed it. Later on Tuesday he confirmed he was "against" the deal. The UK government said it would "never compromise on our national security", while the prime minister's official spokesperson insisted the US still supported the move. The UK signed the £3.4bn ($4.6bn) agreement in May, under which it would retain control of a UK-US military base on the largest of the islands, Diego Garcia. In a post on his Truth Social platform that morning, Trump had said: "Shockingly, our 'brilliant' NATO Ally, the United Kingdom, is currently planning to give away the Island of Diego Garcia, the site of a vital U.S. Military Base, to Mauritius, and to do so FOR NO REASON WHATSOEVER. "There is no doubt that China and Russia have noticed this act of total weakness." He added: "The UK giving away extremely important land is an act of GREAT STUPIDITY, and is another in a very long line of National Security reasons why Greenland has to be acquired." Responding, the prime minister's official spokesman said that the US supports the deal and "the president explicitly recognised its strength last year". He added that it was also backed by the UK's Five Eyes allies, the other members of which - besides the UK and US - are Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Asked if he could categorically say the Chagos deal would go ahead, even though it is still going through Parliament, the spokesman said: "Yes. Categorically, our position hasn't changed." Earlier, a UK government spokesperson said it had acted "because the base on Diego Garcia was under threat after court decisions undermined our position and would have prevented it operating as intended in future". They added that the agreement had secured the operations of the joint US-UK military base "for generations, with robust provisions for keeping its unique capabilities intact and our adversaries out", and noted the deal had been welcomed by allies including the US. Questioned about his position on the deal at the White House later on Tuesday, Trump said: "When they originally were going to do it they were talking about doing some concept of ownership, but now they're looking to essentially just do a lease and sell it, and I'm against that." The Chagos Islands are a "reasonably important area of the globe", he said, adding: "I think they should keep it." "I don't know why they're doing it - do they need money?" Trump added. Mauritius' attorney general Gavin Glover said he still expects the agreement to go ahead. In a statement he said it was "important to remember" that the deal was "negotiated, concluded and signed exclusively between the United Kingdom and the Republic of Mauritius". He added: "The sovereignty of the Republic of Mauritius over the Chagos Archipelago is already unambiguously recognised by international law and should no longer be subject to debate." The agreement followed a long-running dispute between the UK and Mauritius - a former British colony - about sovereignty over the Chagos Islands. The Chagos Islands were separated from Mauritius in 1965, when Mauritius was still a British colony. Britain purchased the islands for £3m, but Mauritius has argued that it was illegally forced to give them away as part of a deal to gain independence. Under the deal agreed in May last year, the UK would hand over sovereignty of the islands to Mauritius, while retaining control of the military base on Diego Garcia. It would lease back Diego Garcia for a period of 99 years - at an average cost of £101m a year. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said that was necessary to protect the base from "malign influence". Before signing the deal, the UK offered Trump an effective veto, because of its implications for US security. Allies of the president had criticised the plan, but during a meeting with Sir Keir in the Oval Office last February, Trump said "I think we'll be inclined to go along with your country". After the agreement was signed in May, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement that Washington "welcomed" the deal. He said it secured the "long-term, stable, and effective operation of the joint US-UK military facility at Diego Garcia", which he described as a "critical asset for regional and global security." Rubio added that "President Trump expressed his support for this monumental achievement during his meeting with Prime Minister Starmer at the White House." A government bill to implement the agreement between the UK and Mauritian governments is currently in its final stages. On Tuesday, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said in a post on X that the prime minister now had "the chance to change course on Chagos". She said that "paying to surrender the Chagos Islands is not just an act of stupidity, but of complete self sabotage". Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, who has long been a critic of the deal, said in a post on X: "Thank goodness Trump has vetoed the surrender of the Chagos islands". Liberal Democrats leader Sir Ed Davey said Trump's comments showed Sir Keir's approach to the US president "has failed". "The Chagos Deal was sold as proof the government could work with him, now it's falling apart," Davey said in a post on X. "It's time for the government to stand up to Trump; appeasing a bully never works." Labour MP and chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Emily Thornberry, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that while the UK should take Trump "seriously", it should not take his comments "literally". She described his comments on Tuesday as an example of "presidential trolling", saying she was "in favour of keeping calm and trying to sit this out". Two British Chagossian women born on Diego Garcia - Bernadette Dugasse and Bertrice Pompe - want the right to return to their place of birth and say they were excluded from discussions over the deal. Pompe told the BBC she views the US president's criticism of the deal as a "good thing" but "only words". Over WhatsApp, Dugasse said: "I want the deal to stop and not [see] money [given] to the Mauritius government." She said Chagossians should be allowed to "sit at the table and decide our future".

Europe to suspend approval of US trade deal as global markets fall The European Parliament is planning to suspend approval of the US trade deal agreed in July, according to sources close to its international trade committee. The suspension is set to be announced in Strasbourg, France on Wednesday. The move would mark another escalation in tensions between the US and Europe, as Donald Trump ratchets up his efforts to acquire Greenland, threatening new tariffs over the issue on the weekend. The stand-off has rattled financial markets, reviving talk of a trade war and the possibility of retaliation against the US for its trade measures. Shares on both sides of the Atlantic were lower on Tuesday, with European stock markets seeing a second day of losses. In the US, the Dow Jones slid more than 1.7%, while the S&P 500 dropped more than 2% and the Nasdaq closed about 2.4% lower. On the currency markets, the US dollar also fell sharply. The euro climbed more than 0.8% against the dollar to $1.1749, before falling back, while the pound also jumped before ending the day up 0.1% at $1.343. Borrowing costs also rippled higher around the world, as the biggest sell-off of long-term government debt in months drove up yields on 30-year bonds in markets including the US, UK and Germany. Trade tensions between the US and Europe had eased since the two sides struck a deal at Trump's Turnberry golf course in Scotland in July. That agreement set US levies on most European goods at 15%, down from the 30% Trump had initially threatened as part of his "Liberation Day" wave of tariffs in April. In exchange, Europe had agreed to invest in the US and make changes at on the continent expected to boost US exports. The deal still needs approval from the European Parliament to become official. But on Saturday, within hours of Trump's threat of US tariffs over Greenland, Manfred Weber, an influential German member of European Parliament, said "approval is not possible at this stage". And Bernd Lange, who chairs the European Parliament's committee on international trade, said there was "no alternative" but to suspend the deal because of the threats over Greenland. "By threatening the territorial integrity and sovereignty of an EU member state and by using tariffs as a coercive instrument, the US undermines the stability and predictability of EU–US trade relations," said Lange, whose committee needs to sign off on the deal before it heads to parliament for a final vote. "There is no alternative but to suspend work on the two Turnberry legislative proposals until the US decides to re-engage on a path of cooperation rather than confrontation, and before any further steps are taken." The decision opens up questions about whether the EU will move forward with threats to retaliate against the US. The bloc had announced a possible €93bn ($109bn, £81bn) worth of American goods that could be hit with levies last year in response to Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs before putting the plan on hold, while the two sides finalised details of a deal. But that reprieve ends on 6 February, meaning EU levies will come into force on 7 February unless the bloc moves for an extension or approves the new deal. French President Emmanuel Macron is among those urging the EU to consider its retaliatory options, including the anti-coercion instrument, nicknamed a "trade bazooka". Washington's "endless accumulation" of new tariffs is "fundamentally unacceptable, even more so when they are used as leverage against territorial sovereignty," he said in a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos. American response Also speaking in Davos, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reiterated his warning to European leaders against retaliation, urging them to "have an open mind". "I tell everyone, sit back. Take a deep breath. Do not retaliate. The president will be here tomorrow, and he will get his message across," he said. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer warned that the US would not let retaliation go without response. "What I've found is that when countries follow my advice, they tend to do okay. When they don't, crazy things happen," Greer said, in remarks reported by the Agence France-Presse. The US has previously expressed impatience with European progress toward approval of the deal amid ongoing disagreements over tech and metals tariffs. The US and the 27-nation European Union are each others' single biggest trade partners, with more than €1.6tn ($1.9tn, £1.4tn) in goods and services exchanged in 2024, according to European figures. That represents nearly a third of all global trade. When Trump started announcing tariffs last year, it prompted threats of retaliation from many political leaders, including in Europe. In the end, however, many, opted to negotiate instead. Only China and Canada stuck by their threats to hit American goods with tariffs, with Canada quietly withdrawing most of those measures in September, concerned they were damaging the Canadian economy. In a speech in Davos on Tuesday, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney urged "middle powers" to unite to push back against the might-makes-right world of great power rivalry that he warned was emerging. "When we only negotiate bilaterally with a hegemon, we negotiate from weakness. We accept what is offered. We compete with each other to be the most accommodating," he warned. "This is not sovereignty. It is the performance of sovereignty while accepting subordination." Looming in the background of the trade tensions is a pending Supreme Court decision over whether many of the tariffs Trump announced last year are legal.

Shock and confusion as Spain struggles for answers after deadly train crash Sunday's high-speed train crash in southern Spain, the worst in over a decade, has been a devastating tragedy for the country, with the loss of at least 42 lives. And amid the grief, many are asking what could have caused such a failure on one of Europe's most admired rail systems. The CIAF rail investigatory commission has started analysing why a train travelling north from Málaga was derailed on a straight section of the route, causing it to collide with an oncoming train, which was also derailed. The Spanish government has described the accident as "extremely strange". Three bodies already located in the wreckage were recovered on Tuesday afternoon, and a 42nd victim was also found at the crash site near Adamuz. The shock felt in this sleepy town has been compounded by confusion at how a rail route that ran efficiently for so long suddenly failed. After its inauguration in 1992, Spain's high-speed rail, or AVE, network was seen as a symbol of the country's modernisation. Built with EU funds, it provided a state-of-the-art transport system that was fast, efficient and safe. A derailment near Santiago de Compostela in 2013 that killed 80 people was not part of the AVE network, although that train was travelling at high speed. Sunday's collision, however, took place on the oldest AVE route, that which connects Madrid with Andalusia. Several officials, including the president of Renfe, the national rail operator, Álvaro Fernández Heredia, said that human error was almost certainly not the cause of the accident, given that neither train was travelling at an excessive speed. Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska insisted that sabotage was not a possible cause. Inevitably, investigators are looking closely at the train that derailed. Owned by Italian firm Iryo, it was manufactured in 2022. Transport Minister Óscar Puente said that carriage number six of the train was going to be examined closely, because it was the first to derail and it offered "many pieces of the puzzle". However, investigators are also examining the section of track where the derailment occurred and intend to analyse parts of it in a laboratory. The revelation that part of the track at the crash site was broken has encouraged speculation that this might be the culprit. The government has been keen to play down such conclusions, pointing out that the track may have been damaged by the force of the collision. Some observers have drawn attention to possible underlying factors on the network. It has emerged that rail infrastructure administrator Adif drew attention to eight technical issues on the line near where the accident happened on social media over the last year. Most of those issues were related to signalling, and last summer one was discussed in the Senate. Adif has reduced the speed limit for the AVE along a 150-km (93-mile) stretch between Madrid and Barcelona, due to concerns about the state of the line. The new limit along that section is 160km/h, nearly half the previous limit. Since the collision, many social media users have flagged posts from the past in which they had complained about uncomfortable movement while travelling on AVE trains. One user filmed the interior of a train vigorously vibrating in December, commenting that it had caused them to "fear for my safety and that of my daughter". In August 2025, train drivers' union Semaf issued a communiqué warning that the state of a number of AVE lines was causing "a lack of comfort and reliability" for those travelling. It called for a reduction in speed limits in order to prevent further degradation of the infrastructure and "to guarantee the safety of workers and travellers". Such grievances might suggest that Spain's high-speed rail network is badly in need of an overhaul. However, the government counters that last year the section of track where the accident took place was renovated, at a cost of €49m (£42m), as part of a broader €700m investment to update the Madrid-Andalusia network in recent years. "When we find the answer, with absolute transparency we will make it known to Spaniards," Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, said of the investigation, as he declared three day's mourning during his visit to Adamuz. That answer could have enormous significance for the future of Spain's renowned rail system.

**Excerpt**

New ceasefire in Syria after Kurdish-led forces pull out of camp for IS families Syria's government has announced a new ceasefire with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), after the militia alliance withdrew from a camp holding thousands of people with alleged links to the jihadist group Islamic State (IS). The SDF said its forces were "compelled" to leave al-Hol camp and redeploy to other cities in north-east Syria "due to the international indifference toward the issue of [IS]". Syria's interior ministry complained that it took place without co-ordination with the government or US-led coalition against IS. Later, the presidency said it had reached an "understanding" with the SDF on the future of Hassakeh province, which has a large Kurdish population. A statement said the SDF would be given four days to carry out consultations on a detailed plan for the peaceful integration of areas under its control into the state. The presidency also promised that government forces would not enter the cities of Hassakeh and Qamishli, or any Kurdish villages. At the same time, the SDF declared its "full commitment to the ceasefire" and said its forces would not initiate any military action unless they were attacked. The SDF also said it was ready to "move forward with implementing" the deal reached with the government on Sunday that was supposed to end almost two weeks of fighting. The agreement should see the Kurdish-run autonomous region in the country's north-east and its key infrastructure brought under government control, as well as the integration of the tens of thousands of SDF fighters into the defence and interior ministries' forces. It represents a major blow for the SDF, which had been reluctant to give up the autonomy that it won for Syria's Kurdish minority when helping US-led coalition forces defeat IS militarily during the country's 13-year civil war. Interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa has vowed to reunify Syria since he led the rebel offensive that overthrew Bashar al-Assad in December 2024, but the country remains deeply divided and has been rocked by waves of deadly sectarian violence. The SDF announced its withdrawal from al-Hol camp as Syrian army and interior ministry forces advanced deep into Hassakeh province after taking control of Deir al-Zour and Raqqa. "Due to the international indifference toward the issue of the IS terrorist organisation and the failure of the international community to assume its responsibilities in addressing this serious matter, our forces were compelled to withdraw from al-Hol camp and redeploy in the vicinity of cities in northern Syria that are facing increasing risks and threats," it said. In a statement sent to Kurdish news agency Hawar, SDF commander Mazloum Abdi urged the US-led coalition - once his main ally - to "bear its responsibilities in protecting facilities". "We withdrew to predominantly Kurdish areas and protecting them is a red line," he added. The Syrian interior ministry said the SDF units had pulled out of al-Hol without any co-ordination in an "attempt to pressure the government over the fight against terrorism". The ministry added that it was "taking all necessary measures in co-ordination and co-operation with the international coalition to maintain security and stability". The defence ministry also said it was ready to assume control of the camp as well as all prisons holding suspected IS fighters in the region. Before the fighting with the government erupted earlier this month, the SDF was holding about 8,000 suspected IS fighters at prisons in north-eastern Syria. Around 34,000 people linked to IS were also being detained at al-Hol and another camp, Roj, the UN reported last August. The population of the camps, of which 60% were children, comprised 6,700 Iraqis, 15,500 Syrians and 8,500 citizens of other countries, including the UK. The SDF, US and UN have long called for the repatriation of the foreign IS suspects and their families from north-eastern Syria, citing the political instability and dire conditions in the prisons and camps, but many countries have refused to take them. Earlier, the government and SDF traded accusations over the escape of suspected IS fighters from an SDF-run prison in Shaddadi, in southern Hassakeh province. The interior ministry said on Monday night that its special forces and army soldiers had entered the town following "the escape of around 120 [IS] terrorists" from the prison. Search operations by the security forces resulted in the arrest of 81 of the fugitives, it added. The SDF said it had lost control of Shaddadi prison in the afternoon after "Damascus-affiliated factions" mounted a series of attacks and killed of dozens of its fighters, who it said had been attempting to "prevent a serious security catastrophe". SDF spokesman Farhad Shami said around 1,500 IS members had escaped during the clashes, according to Reuters news agency. The SDF also accused government forces of attacking al-Aqtan prison, north of the city of Raqqa, which is holding IS members and leaders. On Tuesday, a statement said the prison's buildings and facilities had been shelled and its water supply cut off. "These practices constitute a blatant violation of humanitarian standards and pose a serious threat to the lives of the detainees," it warned. However, the defence ministry denied that there had been clashes in the vicinity of the prison. It said the facility was "fully secured", with military police and internal security forces deployed around the facility and in contact with the administration to ensure supplies were provided. The US, which was once the SDF's main ally in Syria, was monitoring developments in Syria with "grave concern", a White House official said. "We urge all parties to exercise maximum restraint, avoid actions that could further escalate tensions, and prioritize the protection of civilians across all minority groups," they added. Special envoy Tom Barrack meanwhile explained that the rationale for the US-SDF partnership had "largely expired", and that his country was currently focused on ensuring the security of facilities holding IS prisoners and facilitating talks between the SDF and President Sharaa's government on implementation of the ceasefire deal. "This moment offers a pathway to full integration into a unified Syrian state with citizenship rights, cultural protections, and political participation - long denied under Bashar al-Assad's regime," he wrote on X. After signing the deal with the SDF on Sunday, Sharaa said he hoped it would allow Syria to "end its state of division and move to a state of unity and progress". However, Abdi said the fighting had been "imposed on us" and that he had accepted the deal "to stop the bloodshed".

Ukraine's parliament and half of Kyiv with no heating after Russian strikes A large Russian aerial strike on Ukraine has left the Ukrainian parliament and half of Kyiv's residential buildings without heating or power as temperatures across the country continue to hover around -10C. President Volodymyr Zelensky, in his evening address on Tuesday, said one million people in the capital remained without power. Drones, ballistic and cruise missiles targeted several locations in Ukraine overnight, including Kyiv, Dnipro in the centre and Odesa in the south. Zelensky said earlier a "significant number" of targets had been intercepted. But he also said that, in terms of air defence missile prices alone, repelling that attack had cost Ukraine about €80m (£69m). Between Monday and Tuesday, at least four people died and 33 others were injured in strikes across Ukraine. Air raid alerts in Kyiv lasted most of the night. Sirens rang out later as Russian drones and cruise missiles approached the capital. On Tuesday morning, more than 5,600 residential buildings – each with dozens of flats – in Kyiv woke up to no heating. A large part of the capital also has no water. Mayor Vitalii Klitschko said almost 80% of those buildings had just had their heating restored following a large-scale attack on 9 January, which knocked out power for much of the city. Since then, relentless efforts by technicians had managed to reinstate electricity and gas for thousands - only for that work to be undone overnight. "I have no electricity and no water," Oleksandr Palii, a 29-year-old veteran, told the BBC. "I didn't sleep until 3am because of the strikes either – there were explosions all night." Parliament speaker Ruslan Stefanchuk said that, just like Ukrainian cities, the Verkhovna Rada was also without basic services of electricity, water and heating, and he called other parliaments not to remain silent. The Ukrainian president had been due to travel to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Tuesday but, in the wake of the overnight strikes, he said he had decided to stay in Kyiv. He would travel to Davos only if documents on security guarantees with the United States and a prosperity plan were ready to be signed, he added. Temperatures have stayed well below freezing since the start of the year. Ukrainian media has reported instances of radiators bursting due to the water in them freezing, leading to flooding in entire buildings. There have also been reports of fires starting due to people using gas heaters indoor. As the power cuts continue, Kyiv residents are finding innovative solutions to carry on living. Many now use portable stoves to cook, and entire buildings chip in to buy generators. But much depends on individual financial capacities. "I think people who are less well-off are coping much worse," says Olha Zasiadvovk, who has a young child. She and other parents have bought lamps and thermal containers for their children's kindergarten "so that when the kitchen has no electricity they can cook all the meals at once and store them." But if electricity is only available sporadically, she says, "the food doesn't keep very well. There were cases when food was cooked in the morning and by dinner the porridge had become completely solid." In recent days, videos have circulated on social media showing Ukrainians barbecuing in snowy yards and dancing to keep warm in the face of continued power cuts and freezing temperatures. But many say this is the worst winter since the start of the full-scale war in 2022, and with no end to hostilities in sight, nerves are frayed. "The resilience of the Ukrainian people cannot be an excuse for this war to continue. It must end as soon as possible," said Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha on Tuesday. The Kyiv city administration said more than 10,000 people, including nearly 800 children, took refuge in the city's metro stations on Monday night. Many of the high-rise buildings that are often hit by drones do not have shelters, so the deep metro system is still the only place people can seek safety as the thudding sounds of air defence systems ring overhead. President Zelensky said Ukraine had received missiles to repel the overnight attack on Monday, and added they had helped significantly. But he also emphasised the need for air defence systems was still critical. In a call with reporters, he said Russia was using "far more" ballistic missiles in its attacks and that Moscow's capacity to produce them had not been dented. "So far, this has not happened. That is why we need more missiles and more air defence systems," he said. A flurry of diplomatic activity in late 2025 gave rise to hope that progress was being made towards a peace deal with Russia. But on Tuesday Zelensky hinted at concerns that growing tensions between the US and Europe could be detrimental to Ukraine's ability to defend itself. As it stands, Kyiv's European partners are buying missiles from the US on Ukraine's behalf. "When it comes to [protection from] ballistic missiles, for now the key is in the hands of the United States of the America," he said. "It is very important that deliveries are timely, that production works, and that partners help us purchase the necessary missiles," Zelensky stressed. "In other words, a great deal in the security of Ukrainians depends on the unity of Europe and America." Additional reporting by Liubov Sholudko.

Colombia sentences ex-paramilitary leader Mancuso to 40 years in jail A tribunal in Colombia has sentenced a former paramilitary leader, Salvatore Mancuso, to 40 years in prison for murders and forced disappearances committed at the height of the country's armed conflict. Mancuso was a commander in the United Self-Defence Forces of Colombia (AUC), a right-wing paramilitary group originally created to defend landowners from attacks by Marxist guerrilla groups, which became involved in drug trafficking. The tribunal found that under his command, AUC members committed more than 100 crimes in La Guajira povince between 2002 and 2006. Mancuso was sent back to Colombia in 2024 after serving a 15-year prison sentence in the US for drug trafficking. The 61-year-old was sentenced on Monday by a special tribunal created to deal with cases arising from Colombia's decades-long armed conflict, in which at least 450,000 people were killed between 1985 and 2018 according to figures compiled by a truth commission. The tribunal said that Mancuso's 40-year-long sentence could be reduced to eight years if he agreed to work with the transitional justice and took part in reparation activities. Mancuso's name became a byword for the atrocities committed by AUC groups in the 1990s and early 2000s. The tribunal said that under his leadership the AUC had targeted members of the indigenous Wayuu group who live in La Guajira, in the far north of Colombia. It documented 117 crimes, including murders, forced disappearances and gender violence, committed by the AUC in the area. Indigenous groups were often caught in between warring factions of Colombia's armed conflict. Marxist rebel groups forcibly recruited many indigenous children into their ranks, holding them against their will in rebel camps where they had to perform chores and were sometimes forced to fight. The AUC and other paramilitary groups, which suspected the indigenous groups of siding with the rebels, drove them off their land and waged a campaign of terror and intimidation against them. The AUC negotiated a peace deal with the Colombian government in 2005 but offshoots of the group refused to lay down arms and became even more heavily involved in the trafficking of drugs, which they had already been engaging in to raise funds for their fight against the guerrilla. Mancuso was extradited to the US in 2008, where he was put on trial on drug trafficking charges. He was sentenced in 2015, after having been found guilty of smuggling large quantities of cocaine into the US "to arm a paramilitary force of more than 30,000 fighters and cement his control over regions of Colombia", the US justice department said at the time. After he had served his sentence in the US, Mancuso, a dual Colombian and Italian national, asked to be allowed to move to Italy. But his request was denied and he was deported to Colombia. There, he offered to provide testimony into how Colombian politicians, business leaders and other members of the country's establishment allegedly cooperated with the AUC. Pleased with his offer of co-operation, the government of Colombian President Gustavo Petro named Mancuso a "promoter of peace", saying he would act as a mediator between the administration and illegal armed groups still active in the country. The move was vehemently criticised by human rights groups who pointed to the atrocities his group carried out under his command. With additional reporting by BBC Monitoring's Latin America team.

**Excerpt**

Ex-president accused of murder plot expelled from Togo to Burkina Faso Togo has arrested and extradited Burkina Faso's former leader to his home country, after authorities in Ouagadougou accused him of plotting to kill his successor. Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba - who came to power in a coup in 2022 before himself being overthrown by Ibrahim Traoré eight months later - is accused by the current regime of masterminding an assassination attempt against Traoré. According to the Togolese justice ministry, Damiba was handed over to the Burkinabè authorities on Saturday. It says as part of the deal, Burkina Faso promised to ensure "physical integrity, dignity and fair‑trial rights of Mr Paul‑Henri Sandaogo Damiba, and the absence of the death penalty". Among the charges levelled at Damiba by Burkina Faso's military government are "criminal embezzlement of public funds, illicit enrichment, corruption, aggravated receiving of stolen goods and money laundering", said Togo's justice ministry in a statement. No comments from Damiba on the charges have been reported and neither have the BBC's calls to him been picked up. Most serious are the murder plot allegations. Earlier this month, Burkina Faso's Security Minister Mahamadou Sana announced on state television that security forces had foiled a planned series of targeted assassinations aimed at destabilising the state, including what he called the "neutralisation" of Traoré. Officials in Ouagadougou have repeatedly accused Damiba of orchestrating plots from exile. In late 2024, he was again named publicly as the head of what authorities described as the "military wing" of a broader conspiracy. Damiba first seized power in January 2022, toppling the elected government of Roch Marc Christian Kaboré amid frustration over the state's failure to curb Islamist violence. But after just eight months, he was himself overthrown by Traoré, then a 34‑year‑old artillery officer who accused him of failing to deliver security improvements. Since then, the Traoré-led junta has tightened its grip on the country, expelling French forces, adopting an assertive nationalist stance and recently reinstating the death penalty, including for crimes of high treason. Despite promises to restore order, Burkina Faso remains mired in one of the world's most severe security crises, with militant jihadist attacks continuing across large parts of the country. The return of Damiba to Burkina Faso, under arrest and possibly facing a long list of criminal charges, is expected to escalate tensions within the military and political establishment. Political observers suggest that repeated accusations, foiled plots and widening divisions within the armed forces will likely lead to questions about the stability of a government still confronting both a brutal insurgency and internal rivalries.

Second lady Usha Vance announces she is pregnant with fourth child Usha Vance, the wife of Vice-President JD Vance, has announced she is pregnant with her fourth child. In a post on X, the second lady said she is looking forward to welcoming a boy in late July. "Usha and the baby are doing well," a statement posted on Tuesday to the second lady's social media account read. Vance and his wife, Usha, 40, have three young children: Ewan, Vivek and Mirabel. Usha Vance (née Chilukuri) was born and raised in the working-class suburbs of San Diego, California, to a mechanical engineer father and a molecular biologist mother who had moved to the US from Andhra Pradesh, India. She met JD Vance as a student at Yale Law School in 2010, when they joined a discussion group on "social decline in white America". Before becoming second lady, Usha Vance had a legal career, including a job as a corporate litigator at firm Munger, Tolles & Olson in San Francisco. She also worked for conservative judges, Chief Justice John Roberts on the Supreme Court and appeals court judge Brett Kavanaugh, before he was appointed by Trump to the Supreme Court. Usha Vance is the first to have a baby as second lady, though other first ladies have had children while their husbands were in office. First lady Frances Cleveland, wife of President Grover Cleveland, gave birth to daughter Esther in the White House in 1893, followed by a second child, Marion, who was born outside the White House. JD Vance has been one of the most vocal members of the Trump administration in calling for higher birth rates in the US. "Let me say very simply: I want more babies in the United States of America," he said in 2025.

Cow astonishes scientists with rare use of tools Scientists are rethinking what cattle are capable of after an Austrian cow named Veronika was found to use tools with impressive skill. The discovery, reported by researchers in Vienna, suggests cows may have far greater cognitive abilities than previously assumed. Veronika, a cow living in a mountain village in the Austrian countryside, has spent years perfecting the art of scratching herself using sticks, rakes, and brooms. Word of her behaviour eventually reached animal intelligence specialists in Vienna, who found Veronika used both ends of the same object for different tasks. If it were her back or another tough area that warranted a good scratch, she would use the bristle end of a broom. When a softer touch was needed, such as on her sensitive underbelly, she would use the smooth handle end. This kind of tool use is rarely seen in the animal kingdom and has never been documented in cattle before. Dr Antonio Osuna-Mascaro of the University of Veterinary Medicine in Vienna said: "We were not expecting cows to be able to use tools, and we were not expecting a cow to use a tool as a multipurpose tool. Until now this has only been consistently reported in chimpanzees." Chimpanzees show the most varied range of tool use outside of humans. They use sticks to gather ants and termites, and stones to crack nuts. However, despite about 10,000 years of humans living alongside cattle, this is the first time scientists have documented a cow using a tool. The researchers say their discovery shows that cows are smarter than we think and that other cows could develop similar skills, given the chance. As for Veronika's owner, organic farmer Witgar Wiegele, he hopes her unexpected talents will inspire people to value the natural world. As he puts it: "Save the nature, then you protect yourself. Nature diversity is the key to survive on this planet." The study is published in the journal Current Biology.

**Excerpt**

Australia parliament passes gun reform and anti-hate bills after Bondi shooting Australia's parliament has voted for sweeping gun law reforms and a crackdown on hate speech, a month after two attackers shot 15 people dead at a Jewish festival at Bondi Beach. Both bills passed the House of Representatives and Senate at a special sitting late on Tuesday. The gun reform measures include a national gun buyback scheme and new checks on firearm licence applications. Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said the Bondi gunmen would not legally have had access to firearms if such a law had been in place prior to the attack, the country's worst mass shooting in decades. Governing Labor senators were backed on the anti-hate bill by Liberal lawmakers, whose coalition partners abstained. After last month's mass shooting, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese came under huge pressure for not having done enough to prevent the attack in the first place, amid growing fears of antisemitism in the Jewish community. Politicians were recalled two weeks early to debate the legislation. Introducing the reforms, Burke said individuals with "hate in their hearts and guns in their hands" had carried out the 14 December attack. The father in the father-son duo allegedly behind the attack legally owned six firearms, while his son had been on the radar of intelligence agencies. The gun reform bill, which cleared the House of Representatives by 96 votes to 45, includes stricter firearm import controls and provisions to improve information sharing between intelligence agencies on people trying to obtain gun licences. The buyback scheme will target "surplus and newly restricted firearms", Burke said, reducing the country's four million registered guns. Burke added that it "comes as a shock to most Australians" to know that the country has more firearms that it did before the 1996 Port Arthur attack, in which a gunman killed 35 people in Tasmania. That attack, the country's worst mass shooting, had prompted the then government to introduce some of the world's strictest gun controls. The new law will bring in some of the most significant changes to Australia's guns laws since then. The hate speech reforms had originally been included in an omnibus bill with the gun reforms but the government split the legislation last week after both the Liberal-National opposition coalition and the Greens said they would vote against. While the Labor government has a comfortable majority in the lower house, it needs the support of other parties in the Senate. Coalition MPs cited concerns about free speech and said the legislation was not clearly defined, among other things, while the Greens said they could not support it unless changes were made to protect all minorities and legitimate protest. But on Tuesday, Liberals leader Sussan Ley, who last week said the bill was "unsalvageable", said her party had reached agreement with the government on a watered-down version. The Liberals had "stepped up to fix legislation" that the government had "mishandled", she said in a statement, adding that the bill had been "narrowed, strengthened and properly focused on keeping Australians safe". The bill includes provisions that will ban groups deemed to spread hate and introduce tougher penalties for preachers who advocate violence. It will be subject to a review every two years by a parliamentary joint committee. The opposition will also be consulted on the listing and delisting of extremist organisations. The bill was passed by the lower house and late in the evening it cleared the Senate - by 38 votes to 22 - after the National Party abstained while their Liberal coalition partners voted in favour. The Greens voted against, saying it would have a "chilling effect" on political debate and protest.

**Excerpt**

France makes first interception targeting small boat crossings to UK French officials have made their first interception on the water as part of a new policy aimed at stopping small boats carrying illegal migrants to the UK. A so-called "taxi-boat" was boarded by French officers on Saturday on the Aa canal in Gravelines, which is on the Channel coast above Calais. It follows a change of tactics agreed in November following growing pressure from the UK government to step up interventions. A photograph of the aftermath of the operation obtained by the BBC shows a number of men - apparently people-smugglers - on an inflatable dinghy with the police launch alongside. The inflatable is then towed to the dockside. The French maritime prefecture declined to comment to the BBC, saying only that there was "an ongoing judicial investigation" regarding the small boat. France agreed to the new tactics at a summit in the UK last July between President Emmanuel Macron and Sir Keir Starmer. Until then French police had only intervened to stop small boats as they were being prepared for launch on beaches. Intervening at sea was judged to be too dangerous. But smugglers' gangs learned to avoid police by using "taxi-boats", which enter the water some distance away and then travel along the coast picking up groups of migrants who themselves enter the water to get aboard. According to an official French documents, this method was proving extremely effective, with an 81% success rate in 2025. The number of migrants who reached the UK from France rose last year from 36,566 in 2024 to 41,472, but it was lower than the peak of 45,774 in 2022. After the July 2025 agreement to start on-water interventions, there were more delays because of worries about the risk to life, and about officers' liability to prosecution were migrants to die in an operation. These concerns appear now to have been addressed. Under the terms of engagement, gendarmes will only intervene to stop "taxi-boats" before they take on migrants – and not when they are fully charged. This seems to have been the procedure used in Saturday's operation. Police suspected that the inflatable, which was moving down the canal to its mouth at the sea, was about to be used for picking up migrants, so they moved to arrest the men on board.

**Excerpt**

Surfer injured in fourth shark attack in Australian state in 48 hours A surfer has been bitten by a shark, the fourth attack along Australia's New South Wales (NSW) coastline in under 48 hours. The 39-year-old man "sustained a wound to his chest" after a shark bit his board on the Mid North Coast on Tuesday morning, police said. He has been released from hospital. It follows three other attacks in Sydney over the past two days. All beaches in Sydney's northern area will remain closed until further notice, said police. The attacks follow days of heavy rains, which NSW Superintendent Joseph McNulty had earlier said may have created a "perfect storm environment" for shark attacks. Rain flushes nutrients into the water, which can draw sharks closer to shore. The attack on Tuesday took place near the Point Plomer campground, about 450km (279 miles) north of Sydney. Steve Pearce, the chief executive of Surf Life Saving NSW, said the surfer was "very fortunate to not have sustained any serious injuries", ABC reported. "We really strongly advocate that nobody swim or surf near river mouths because it's obviously an area where sharks congregate," Pearce said. "If it's dirty water I'd think twice about going in there." A young surfer had a similarly lucky escape at Dee Why Beach in Sydney on Monday, but a shark attack at nearby Manly hours later left a 27-year-old with "life-changing" injuries. On Sunday, a 12-year-old boy was also critically injured when bitten at a popular Sydney Harbour beach. Authorities believe bull sharks were involved in most of the recent attacks. Bull sharks, which can be found in both fresh water and salt water, are "one of the few sharks that are potentially dangerous to people", the Australian Museum says. They are the third deadliest shark species, according to the International Shark Attack File. Last November, a woman was killed and a man was seriously injured after being attacked by a bull shark on a remote beach, also on the NSW Mid North coast. Bull sharks are typically seen around Sydney in January and February - the summer months in Australia - as the "water is at their preferred temperature", Dr Daryl McPhee, associate professor of environmental science at Bond University, told the BBC. Though Australia is a global shark attack hotspot, the chances of being attacked are still minute - making this string of shark attacks in NSW a rare phenomenon. "This series of bites from bull sharks in such a short period of time is highly unusual," said McPhee. Police on Monday advised the public to avoid waterways in NSW due to recent weather, which has decreased water quality and visibility. "I would recommend not swimming in the harbour or our other river systems across NSW at this time," Superintendent Joseph McNulty told reporters. Rain can concentrate fish that bull sharks prey on downstream in rivers and beaches, McPhee said, adding that "bull sharks are well adapted to feeding in murky water after rain". "Where you find the fish, you find the bull sharks. Unfortunately, that sometimes occurs at popular beach locations."

Palestinian children's football pitch faces Israeli demolition ultimatum A Palestinian children's football club in the occupied West Bank faces imminent demolition despite an international campaign to save it. Its supporters say it provides a rare sporting opportunity for young Palestinian players. But Israel insists it's been built without the necessary permits. In this deeply divided land so much is contested; from the identities and faiths of the people who live here, to every inch of the ground they stand on. Recently, that has come to include one small patch of artificial turf laid down under the shadow of the giant concrete wall that isolates Israel from much of the occupied West Bank. In the context of the 7 October attacks, the two-year war in Gaza and the fragility of the current ceasefire, there are without doubt far more pressing issues. But this is a story freighted with symbolism and one which has drawn outsized international attention because of its connection to that other world religion - football. On the day we visit, a group of Palestinian children are lining up to take penalty shots in the winter sunshine. The construction of the pitch began here on the edge of Bethlehem in 2020, and today it provides a place to practise for more than 200 young players from the nearby Aida refugee camp. The cramped and crowded streets contain the homes of the descendants of Palestinian families who were forced or who fled from their homes during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. On 3 November last year, as the children made their short walk from the camp for that day's training, they found a notice pinned to the gate of the football field declaring it to be illegal. The notice was followed soon by a demolition order. "We don't have anywhere else to play," 10-year-old Naya told me, wearing a Brazil shirt with the name of the footballing legend Neymar emblazoned on the back. "We are building our dreams here," she said. "If they demolish our field, they will demolish our dreams." I asked another young player, Mohammed, what his reaction was when he heard the news that the club was earmarked for destruction. "I was upset," he told me. "This is a field I really care for." The community has fought back, posting videos on social media, launching a petition attracting hundreds of thousands of signatures, and receiving messages of international support. The club says that after representations from a lawyer it was recently given a seven-day reprieve. But that extension expired on Monday, leaving it with a difficult choice. As is common practice in such cases, the club owners must either demolish the pitch themselves or wait for the Israeli authorities to do it forcibly, after which they'll be presented with the bill. The looming presence of the wall, which runs along the length of one of the touchlines, is just one of the many complex layers that underpin the Israeli occupation of the territory that Palestinians want as the basis for a future state. Militarily, Israel exerts control over the entirety of the West Bank. But administrative control – its day-to-day governance – is divided between a patchwork of Palestinian-run areas and Israeli-run ones. The maps on which those distinctions are based were drawn up as a key part of the Oslo Accords, signed in the 1990s by Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO). The West Bank was split into three categories of territory. Areas A and B were pockets of land over which the Palestinian Authority was given civil control. In those marked as Area A, Palestinians were also given nominal security control. Area C – more than 60% of the total – was to remain temporarily under full Israeli control. The idea was that it would eventually be gradually transferred to Palestinian self-rule as the negotiations continued. While that never happened, with both sides blaming each other for the failure of the peace process, the maps remain the basis for much of how the West Bank is governed today. Bethlehem itself is designated as Area A. But the maps show Israel exercising Area C civil authority over much of the surrounding countryside, right up the city's edge. Israel began building its concrete barrier in the early 2000s in the face of a wave of deadly suicide bombings and other attacks carried out by Palestinians which killed hundreds of Israelis. Critics claim that today, as it has grown in length, the wall has become a tool for punishing many thousands of ordinary Palestinians, separating them from their workplaces, dividing their communities and effectively annexing parts of their land. But what's now in contention in Bethlehem is a tiny, narrow patch of ground on the Palestinian side of the wall. For the residents of the Aida camp looking for space to build a football field, it was just large enough to accommodate their needs. But for Israel it remains – and is marked on the maps – as part of Area C, even though the construction of the wall has left it marooned on the Bethlehem side. Satellite photos show that the space was vacant in 2019 and then, year by year, the pitch can be seen beginning to take shape, fitting in snuggly right up against the wall. The demolition order argues that it was built without the necessary permissions on a plot of land over which Israel still asserts full civil control. For Palestinians, there is no small irony in the fact that they're being denied the right to build a small football pitch on the boundary of their city, inside the wall that fences them in. While turning down permission for their buildings and demolishing existing ones, Israel continues to approve the construction of vast new Israeli settlements across Area C, which are considered illegal under international law. Last September, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signed an agreement to push ahead with a major and highly controversial settlement that will house 20,000 Israelis. Located between occupied East Jerusalem and the already existing settlement of Maale Adumim, if completed it would effectively cut the West Bank in half which, Palestinians say, will all but destroy their aspirations for nationhood. The Israeli government agrees. "There will be no Palestinian state," Netanyahu said at the signing ceremony. "This place belongs to us." Some of his ministers speak openly of the full annexation of the West Bank. In Bethlehem, the football club – which claims it did receive verbal permission in 2020 for the pitch – believes the threat of demolition is about far more than planning law. "The Israelis don't want us to have any kind of hope, they don't want us to have any opportunity," Mohammad Abu Srour, one of the board members of the Aida Youth Centre, told me. The idea, he suggested, was to make life deliberately hard. "The moment that we lose hope and opportunity we are going to leave. This is the only explanation for us." We approached the Israeli body that manages civilian affairs in the West Bank for comment. Although the demolition order was issued on its behalf, we were referred instead to the Israeli military, which oversees its work. The IDF gave us the following statement. "Along the security fence, there is a confiscation order and a prohibition on construction; therefore, the construction in the area was carried out unlawfully," it said. As they wait to see what happens next, the children of Aida hope that the international attention might be enough to sway the authorities' minds. But for now, as the wider conflict grinds on, the future of one small football pitch is hanging in the balance.

Trump's full messages with European leaders – and what they tell us A series of text exchanges between Donald Trump and European leaders about ownership of Greenland have sensationally been released. The US president has pledged to tell European leaders at this week's forum in Davos, Switzerland, that "we will have to have" Greenland. Diplomacy has traditionally been seen as synonymous with discretion and most of it continues to be behind closed doors. The latest revelations, however, fall in a different category. Here are the messages in full and what experts told the BBC one should read into them: Text exchange between Trump and Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Støre Released by the office of Støre following a freedom of information request by the BBC, 18 January at 15:48 (14:48 GMT) Støre: Dear Mr President, dear Donald - on the contact across the Atlantic - on Greenland, Gaza, Ukraine - and your tariff announcement yesterday. You know our position on these issues. But we believe we all should work to take this down and de-escalate - so much is happening around us where we need to stand together. We are proposing a call with you later today - with both of us or separately - give us a hint of what you prefer! Best - Alex [on behalf of Finnish President Alexander Stubb] and Jonas Trump's response, 18 January 16:15 (15:15 GMT): Dear Jonas: Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America. Denmark cannot protect that land from Russia or China, and why do they have a "right of ownership" anyway? There are no written documents, it's only that a boat landed there hundreds of years ago, but we had boats landing there, also. I have done more for NATO than any other person since its founding, and now, NATO should do something for the United States. The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland. Thank you! President DJT This is evidence that "diplomatic norms have been changing for a while and it's not just President Trump", the former Nato spokesperson, Oana Lungescu, told the BBC. "It's rather unusual for private messages between leaders to be made public, but it's part of President Trump's propensity of conducting diplomacy in public. You could say it's the ultimate megaphone diplomacy." Mark Weller, professor at Cambridge University who has advised governments and international organisations, agrees. "Exchanges between governments at a high level are ordinarily carefully scripted. This avoids misunderstanding and accidents when responding on important points without due reflection," Weller says. "This is not a problem for President Trump, who thrives on disrupting expectations." But he notes that it is unusual "for the cool Norwegians to retaliate in kind - clearly there is a sense that one must fight fire with fire, in addition to personal frustration about the loss of all diplomatic form". Message from French President Emmanuel Macron to Trump Posted on Truth Social by Trump, 19 January, 17:01 (12:01 GMT): From president Macron to President Trump My friend, We are totally in line on Syria We can do great things on Iran I do not understand what you are doing on Greenland Let us try to build great things : 1) I can set up a G7 meeting after Davos in Paris on Thursday afternoon. I can invite the Ukrainians, the Danish, the Syrians and the Russians in the margins 2) Let us have a dinner together in Paris together on Thursday before you go back to the US Emmanuel Macron's texts being exposed could be "embarrassing" for the president, said former French diplomat Francios-Joseph Schichan, as some parts were "exposing". "At the beginning of the text, Macron clearly acknowledges something he didn't acknowledge in public, which is he didn't understand Trump's behaviour with Greenland," Schichan said. "I think that's damaging because you don't want to be exposed like that, so that's pretty embarrassing." However, Schichan noted Macron's invitation to Trump with a meeting at the G7 [group of most industrialised countries] "isn't embarrassing, that's something he precisely needs to do". The texts further show how "Macron is trying to engage with classic diplomacy", he said, warning, "that doesn't work with Trump because he puts it on Truth Social and the plan blows up". "That's another element of global diplomacy that's crumbling. You used to be able to have a one-on-one conversation in private, but now you don't know if it'll end up on social media." Message from Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte to Trump Posted on Truth Social by Trump, 20 January, 01:53 (06:53 GMT) : Mr. President, dear Donald - what you accomplished in Syria today is incredible. I will use my media engagements in Davos to highlight your work there, in Gaza, and in Ukraine. I am committed to finding a way forward on Greenland. Can't wait to see you. Yours, Mark Similar to Macron, Rutte's private message to Trump being exposed is "unusual", says Lungescu - the longest-serving of Nato spokespeople and now a senior fellow at Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) defence think tank. Lungescu said Rutte's message was "consistent in what he says publicly and privately" - whilst other leaders "may appear stronger in public and more conciliatory in private". "So there's been a lot of risks that what was private is no longer so," she said, adding that "if people are tempted to appear powerful on social media, that risks leading to more rhetorical escalation rather than working behind the scenes to find win-win solutions." "The space for diplomacy will have a focus on more phone calls and more face-to-face encounters. In that case, that may bring us back to traditional diplomacy," Lungescu said. Marc Weller, who is also a programme director for international law at Chatham House think tank as well as a former UN senior mediation expert, cautions that "the tendency to publish as it happens really makes any serious, confidential-crisis diplomacy impossible where rapid and confidential action and dialogue is in fact required".

**Excerpt**

Confronted over Greenland, Europe is ditching its softly-softly approach to Trump Something in Europe has snapped. Donald Trump doubled down again on Monday night in his insistence that the US "has to have" Greenland for national security reasons. He predicted that Europe's leaders aren't "gonna push back too much". But that's not the plan they have in mind when their paths cross with the US president at the World Economic Forum (WEF) on Wednesday. Greenland is a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark - a member of the EU and of Nato. President Trump is now leaning heavily on Denmark's allies in both those organisations to abandon Copenhagen and let the US take control of Greenland, or face punitive taxes on all their exports to the United States. It's a horror scenario for European economies, which are already in the doldrums, especially those reliant on exporting to the US like Germany's car industry and Italy's luxury goods market. On Monday Germany's finance minister said “we will not allow ourselves to be blackmailed,” after an emergency meeting ahead of the WEF with his French counterpart. The Trump threats landed like a slap in the face of European governments, who (separately, in the case of the EU and the UK) had only just settled tariff deals with the US president last year. "We're living through uncharted territories. We've never seen this before. An ally, a friend of 250 years, is considering using tariffs… as a geopolitical weapon," said France's Finance Minister Roland Lescure. His German counterpart Lars Klingbeil added: "A line has been crossed... You'll understand that today I'm not saying exactly what will happen. But one thing must be clear: Europe must be prepared." All of a sudden, the softly-softly approach to Trump, that Europe's leaders had clearly favoured since he returned for a second term to the White House, seems to have passed its sell-by date. Europe's good cop, bad cop approach It's too early to read the last rites on transatlantic relations altogether but the EU, at least, is hoping to approach the US president in Switzerland this Wednesday at the Global Economic Forum "speaking softly, while carrying a big stick" to paraphrase a former US president. Theodore (Teddy) Roosevelt believed that, to achieve your goals, you need diplomacy backed by credible power. And Europe now seems to be adopting a good cop, bad cop approach. European leaders are telling President Trump they'll support him in prioritising Arctic security, so there's no need for him to go it alone over Greenland. At the same time, EU diplomats have let it be known they're considering imposing €93 billion (£80 billion) worth of tariffs on US goods or even restricting the access of American businesses, possibly including banks and high tech companies - to the bloc's massive single market, if Trump goes ahead with his "Greenland tariffs" as they've become known. These retaliatory measures would most likely have a knock-on effect on US consumers too. European Union investors have a massive presence in nearly all 50 US states and are said to be responsible for employing 3.4 million Americans. The EU has a weak voice on the world stage of international diplomacy. The bloc is made up of 27 often bickering countries. But it has huge clout when it comes to the global economy and trade, where decisions are largely taken by the European Commission on behalf of EU single market members. The European Union is the world's biggest trader of goods and services, accounting for nearly 16% of world trade in 2024. So, Brussels is crossing its fingers that President Trump will climb down from from his maximalist position and negotiate a compromise solution, if he realises, that he may end up gaining an island (Greenland) but he'll probably lose close allies (Europe), and be seen as responsible for US consumer costs going up (because of EU retaliatory tariffs). "Our priority is to engage, not escalate," EU Commission deputy spokesperson Olof Gill said on Monday. "Trump is forcing the Europeans to grow a spine," says Niclas Poitiers, an economist and expert in international trade at the Brussels-based Bruegel think-tank. "[While] the damage of [Trump's] tariffs is very manageable for Europe… the much bigger question here is not economic but security and foreign policy. "The EU cannot afford not to react." Trust in US security guarantees But on Monday, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent appeared less than impressed. Speaking in Davos, he painted a picture of a US president with his mind set: "The president is looking at Greenland as a strategic asset for the United States. We are not going to outsource our hemispheric security to anyone else." European tariff retaliation would be "unwise", he warned. And here Europe feels stuck. Damned if it takes action. Damned if it doesn't. Some in Europe worry that if they are now more confrontational with Trump, they risk alienating the US even further. And the brutal truth is: Europe needs Washington to secure a sustainable peace deal for Ukraine and for its own continental security. Despite pledging more defence-spending, Europe is still heavily reliant on the US. While also reiterating his support for Danish and Greenlandic sovereignty, Sir Keir Starmer, the UK prime minister, was at pains to make that point on Monday, saying it was in the UK's "national interest that we continue to work with the Americans when it comes to defence, to security and to intelligence. "Our nuclear deterrence is our foremost weapon. A deterrent when it comes to securing the safety of everybody in the United Kingdom is my primary duty and that requires us to have a good relationship with the United States." But, if Europe continues to try to "manage" president Trump, rather than stand up to him, when he is threatening the sovereignty of his fellow Nato ally (Denmark), and brandishing economic sanctions over other allies if they support Copenhagen, then the continent risks looking seriously weak. On X on Monday the EU's top diplomat Kaja Kallas wrote, "We have no interest to pick a fight, but we will hold our ground". As a former prime minister of Estonia, a country that fears the looming shadow of an expansionist Russia, she is keen to demonstrate to Moscow that Europe can - and will - bare its teeth, if pushed. "Europeans can't shy away anymore," Tara Varma told me. She's an expert in security and geopolitics at think tank, German Marshall Fund. "They tried personal diplomacy alone [with Donald Trump] over the last year, in order to try and tie him into Europe's collective defence and guaranteeing Ukraine's security after a ceasefire with Russia," she said. But if he can suddenly turn around (as he just has), linking economic and security issues and threatening Nato, if he doesn't get his way over a certain issue, then, she says, how much trust can Europe ultimately put in US security guarantees under this administration?" Putin and the Board of Peace Watching all this from the sidelines is not only Russia, but China. In their eyes the West - traditionally with the US and Europe tightly-knit at its core, dominant for decades in global politics - is now unravelling. The world is increasingly dominated by a number of big powers, including Russia and China, but also India, Saudi Arabia and, to an extent, Brazil. China hopes Donald Trump's apparent fickleness with his allies may make Beijing appear a more stable, reliable partner and drive more international trade its way. Canada, which President Trump had threatened to make the 51st state of the US, has just agreed to a limited trade deal with Beijing. It's trying to reduce its exposure to Washington. The US president has also shown little regard for multilateral institutions like Nato and the United Nations set up by western powers after the second world war, to manage global order. Some point to the Board of Peace that President Trump is now establishing, and that he reportedly wants to stage a signing ceremony for this Thursday in Davos. Many world leaders and leading business figures are attending the conference. The Board is ostensibly designed to oversee the reconstruction of Gaza after Israel's devastating two year offensive, aimed at destroying Hamas following its attack on Israel on 7 October 2023. But the Board's charter calls for "a more nimble and effective international peace-building body", suggesting its remit would be far wider, possibly to rival the UN. That's how France's President sees it. A source close to Emmanuel Macron issued a statement on Monday saying that France did not plan to accept an invitation that, "along with many countries", it had received to join the Board of Peace. "The [Board's] Charter... raises major questions, particularly with regard to respect for the principles and structure of the United Nations, which cannot be called into question under any circumstances," the statement reads. The Kremlin said on Monday that Vladimir Putin had also been asked to join the Board, suggesting that Trump is keen to maintain ties with the Russian president, despite Moscow's four-year long assault on Ukraine and its failure so far to accept a US-backed peace plan. Questions have been raised too about Trump's overarching role on the Board, and his demand that world leaders pay $1 billion for permanent membership. But Tara Varma insists that the Peace Board isn't about peace. "How can it be, if you invite leaders like Putin to be part of it? "Trump wants to be seen as a peacemaker. He wants the headlines, but without doing the hard graft to lay the groundwork needed for peace to be durable. His is more of a hit and run strategy. "He can't replace multilateral institutions like the UN that have been around for 80 years." Relations are strained but not broken Perhaps, though, President Trump, with his flouting of decades-old international norms, is shaking some of these multilateral institutions up a bit, pushing or even forcing them to modernise and become more relevant. The membership of the UN security council should arguably be less western-centric, and more representative of changes in global power structures. Nato's European members have admitted they ought to be paying more for their own defence. Trump is not the first US president to say that they should, though he's far blunter. It was after he threatened that the US would no longer defend nations that didn't pay their way, that all Nato members except Spain agreed to dramatically increase security spending. Back to Greenland, polls suggest 55% of Americans don't want to buy the island and 86% oppose a military takeover by the US. Denmark and other European powers have been lobbying lawmakers on Capitol Hill to persuade them that Greenlandic and Danish sovereignty must be protected. Transatlantic relations aren't broken yet, though they are damaged. Donald Trump is still picking up the phone to his pal, the Italian premier, Giorgia Meloni, to Starmer, and to Nato's Secretary General Mark Rutte. Lines of communication are still open. Ultimately, though, if Europeans want to try to cut through with Donald Trump, they will have to stick together. Not only the EU's disparate member states, not just Nato: all countries together. And the UK, with its closer relationship with the US will be key here. But Europe's leaders are torn between wanting to do what they see as right internationally, and their own domestic concerns. If a full-blown transatlantic trade war were to break out, that would hurt their voters. All singing from the same sheet over Greenland for any length of time, is going to be tough.
