**Excerpt**

Trump says he will '100%' carry out Greenland tariffs threat, as EU vows to protect its interests Donald Trump has vowed to "100%" follow through on his threat to impose tariffs on European countries who oppose his demand to take control of Greenland. European allies have rallied around Greenland's sovereignty. Denmark's foreign minister emphasised the US president cannot threaten his way to ownership of the semi-autonomous Danish territory. UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper reiterated the UK's position that the future of Greenland is for "Greenlanders and for the Danes alone" to decide. On Monday, Trump declined to rule out the use of force and insisted he would press ahead with the threatened tariffs on goods arriving in the US from the UK and seven other Nato-allied countries. Asked by NBC News if he would use force to seize Greenland, Trump answered: "No comment". The US president said he would charge Britain a 10% tariff "on any and all goods" sent to the US from 1 February, increasing to 25% from 1 June, until a deal is reached for Washington to purchase Greenland from Denmark. Trump said the same would apply to Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Finland - all of whom are members of the defence alliance Nato which was founded in 1949. Asked if he will follow through on the tariff threat, Mr Trump told NBC News: "I will, 100%." Trump added: "Europe ought to focus on the war with Russia and Ukraine because, frankly, you see what that's gotten them... That's what Europe should focus on - not Greenland." Denmark has warned that US military action in Greenland would spell the end of Nato. In recent days, Greenland has received support from European members of the alliance - some even sent a handful of troops to Greenland last week in a move seen as symbolic. However, Trump followed that deployment with an announcement to impose tariffs on the eight Nato allies. Danish foreign minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said that Europe had to show President Trump tariff threats were "not the way forward". "We have red lines that can't be crossed," he told Sky News. "You can't threaten your way to ownership of Greenland. I have no intention of escalating this situation." Nato secretary general Mark Rutte said the alliance will keep working with Denmark and Greenland on the security of the Arctic. The European Union is to hold an emergency summit in Brussels for its leaders on Thursday where they will discuss how to respond to Trump's latest threat to take over Greenland. Kaja Kallas, the EU's foreign policy chief, said the bloc has "no interest to pick a fight, but we will hold our ground". "But trades threats are not the way to go about this," Kallas added. "Sovereignty is not for trade." It comes as text exchanges between Trump and the Norwegian prime minister were released - showing that on Sunday the US president blamed Norway for the fact he didn't get the Nobel Peace Prize. In his reply - seen by the BBC - Jonas Gahr Støre explained that an independent committee, not the government of Norway, awards the prize which last October went to Venezuela's opposition leader María Corina Machado. "Norway's position on Greenland is clear. Greenland is a part of the Kingdom of Denmark, and Norway fully supports the Kingdom of Denmark on this matter," Støre added. Trump also addressed the text message exchange in Monday's interview and said: "Norway totally controls it [the Nobel Prize] despite what they say. "They like to say they have nothing to do with it, but they have everything to do with it."

**Excerpt**

'Europe is at a total loss': Russia gloats over Greenland tensions Listen to Donald Trump and you would think Moscow and Beijing were lying in wait off the coast of Greenland, ready to pounce to boost their power in the Arctic. "There are Russian destroyers, there are Chinese destroyers and, bigger, there are Russian submarines all over the place," President Trump said recently. That is why, according to America's president, US control of Greenland is essential. So how do you think Moscow has reacted to its alleged plot being uncovered and potentially thwarted by a US takeover of Greenland? The Russians can't be pleased. Right? Wrong. In an astonishing article, the Russian government paper is full of praise for Trump and critical of European leaders who oppose a US annexation of Greenland. "Standing in the way of the US president's historic breakthrough is the stubbornness of Copenhagen and the mock solidarity of intransigent European countries, including so-called friends of America, Britain and France," writes Rossiyskaya Gazeta. "Europe does not need the American greatness that Trump is promoting. Brussels is counting on 'drowning' the US president in the midterm congressional elections, on preventing him from concluding the greatest deal of his life." "Greatest deal"? The reporter explains what he means. I have to keep reminding myself I am reading the Russian government newspaper, not a pro-Trump publication in America. "If Trump annexes Greenland by July 4 2026, when America celebrates the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, he will go down in history as a figure who asserted the greatness of the United States," writes Rossiyskaya Gazeta. "With Greenland, the US becomes the second largest country in the world after Russia, surpassing Canada in area. For Americans, that's on par with such planetary events as the abolition of slavery by Abraham Lincoln in 1862 or the territorial conquests of the Napoleonic Wars. "If, thanks to Trump, Greenland becomes part of America…for sure the American people will not forget such an achievement." And the Russian reporter has this message for America's president: don't U-turn. "It is dangerous for the American president to back down over Greenland. This would weaken the position of the Republican Party in the midterm elections and likely result in a Democrat majority on Capitol Hill with the ensuing consequences for Trump. Whereas a rapid annexation of Greenland before the elections can change this political trend." In other words, it's in Trump's interest to push ahead with his plans to take over Greenland: according to the Russian government paper. Let that sink in. But why the praise from Moscow? Why the apparent encouragement? It's because Russia has much to gain from the current situation. Trump's fixation with Greenland, his determination to take over the island and impose tariffs on European countries that oppose his plan have put a huge strain on the transatlantic alliance: both on America's relations with Europe, and within Nato. Anything that weakens – or threatens to split – the Western alliance is viewed by Moscow as a huge positive for Russia. "Europe is at a total loss and, to be honest, it's a pleasure to watch this," gloated the Russian tabloid Moskovsky Komsomolets in one of its articles about Greenland. What's more, American threats to annex Greenland are being used by pro-Kremlin commentators to try to justify Russia's war on Ukraine. Victory in Ukraine remains the Kremlin's priority. Moscow believes that maintaining a positive relationship with the Trump administration will help achieve this. Hence Russia's criticism of Europe. But not of Donald Trump.

**Excerpt**

Italian fashion designer Valentino dies aged 93 Italian fashion designer Valentino Garavani, known as Valentino, has died at the age of 93. One of the giants of 20th Century fashion, Valentino's creations were worn by celebrities and well-known figures including Elizabeth Taylor, Nancy Reagan, Sharon Stone, Julia Roberts and Gwyneth Paltrow. He co-founded the Valentino fashion house in 1960 and ranked alongside Giorgio Armani and Karl Lagerfeld at the top of the profession. In a statement posted on Instagram, the Valentino Garavani and Giancarlo Giammetti Foundation said: "He passed away peacefully in his Roman home, surrounded by the love of his family." The foundation said Valentino will be lying in state at Rome's Piazza Mignanelli between 21 and 22 January. Valentino's funeral service will be held the following day at the Basilica of Saint Mary of the Angels and Martyrs, the foundation said. Born in Lombardy in May 1932, Valentino was known for his collections that displayed luxury, wealth and opulence. He moved to Paris to study at the Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne when he was just 17, and went on to work with designers Jacques Fath, Balenciaga, Jean Dessès and Guy Laroche. His adoption of his signature colour "Valentino red", inspired by a trip to Spain, helped elevate the brand to global fame with the debut of the iconic fiesta dress. It became so meaningful for the house that for Valentino's last collection in 2008 all the models wore red dresses for the finale. Valentino designed the wedding dress of Princess Madeleine of Sweden when she married British-American financier Christopher O'Neill in June 2013. In December 2023, he was honoured with the outstanding achievement award at the British Fashion Awards which were held at London's Royal Albert Hall. Alexandra Shulman, the former editor-in-chief of British Vogue, told BBC Radio 4's PM programme that every aspect of Valentino "epitomised glamour and luxury". "It is very sad news because he was one of the last of the great designers of the modern day and I think his main contribution will be that he was what people wanted a fashion designer to be," Shulman said. "He really didn't care that much that he wasn't the most fashionable, the most cutting-edge designer, he just wanted to produce clothes that were beautiful - and they were. "He also kept his celebrity customers for a long time, he started off with people like Jacqueline Kennedy who wore Valentino when she was in mourning." Shulman listed a number of Hollywood stars who have been big supporters of Valentino's designs over the last 15 years - including Paltrow, Nicole Kidman and Jennifer Lopez. "He was helped in later years by the red carpet [becoming] such a thing, because that's what his clothes were about," Shulman added. "They weren't something you slipped on to go to the office - they were really fabulous gowns."

**Excerpt**

Spanish PM vows to find cause of deadly high-speed train crash Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has promised to get to the bottom of why two high-speed trains collided in southern Spain killing at least 40 people, as rescuers continue to search the wreckage. After visiting the site of the crash, Sanchez also announced three days of national mourning for victims. More than 120 more people were injured as carriages on a Madrid-bound train derailed and crossed over to the opposite tracks, colliding with an oncoming train in Adamuz on Sunday evening. The crash is the worst the country has seen in more than a decade. Rail network operator Adif said the collision happened at 19:45 local time (18:45 GMT) on Sunday, about an hour after one of the trains left Málaga heading north to Madrid, when it derailed on a straight stretch of track near the city of Córdoba. The force of the crash pushed the carriages of the second train into an embankment, according to Transport Minister Óscar Puente. He added that most of those killed and injured were in the front carriages of the second train, which was travelling south from Madrid to Huelva. Rescue teams said the twisted wreckage of the trains made it difficult to recover people trapped inside the carriages. Sanchez visited the site of the crash with senior officials on Monday afternoon. "This is a day of sorrow for all of Spain, for our entire country," he told reporters. "We are going to get to the truth, we are going to find the answer, and when that answer about the origin and cause of this tragedy is known, as it could not be otherwise, with absolute transparency and absolute clarity, we will make it public." Puente said an investigation could take at least a month, describing the incident as "extremely strange". But Reuters news agency quoted an unnamed source briefed on initial investigations as saying experts had found a faulty joint on the rails, which was causing a gap between rail sections to widen as trains travelled over it. They added that the joint was key to identifying the cause of the accident. Spain's El País newspaper said it was not clear whether the fault was a cause or a result of the crash. Four hundred passengers and staff were on board the two trains, the rail authorities said. Emergency services treated 122 people, with 41, including children, still in hospital. Of those, 12 are in intensive care. Puente said the death toll "is not yet final". Officials are working to identify the dead. The type of train involved in the crash was a Freccia 1000, which can reach top speeds of 400 km/h (250 mph), a spokesperson for the Italian rail company Ferrovie dello Stato told Reuters. Salvador Jimenez, a journalist with RTVE who was on one of the trains, said the impact felt like an "earthquake". "I was in the first carriage. There was a moment when it felt like an earthquake and the train had indeed derailed," Jimenez said. Footage from the scene appears to show some train carriages had tipped over on their sides. Rescue workers can be seen scaling the train to pull people out of the lopsided train doors and windows. A Madrid-bound passenger, José, told public broadcaster Canal Sur: "There were people and screaming, calling for doctors." All high-speed services between Madrid and the southern cities of Malaga, Cordoba, Sevilla and Huelva have been suspended until Friday. King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia said they were following news of the disaster "with great concern" and offered their "most heartfelt condolences". The emergency agency in the region of Andalusia urged any crash survivors to contact their families or post on social media that they are alive. The Spanish Red Cross has deployed emergency support services to the scene, while also offering counselling to families nearby. Miguel Ángel Rodríguez from the Red Cross told RNE radio: "The families are going through a situation of great anxiety due to the lack of information. These are very distressing moments." In 2013, Spain suffered its worst high-speed train derailment in Galicia, north-west Spain, which left 80 people dead and 140 others injured. Spain's high-speed rail network is the second largest in the world, behind China, connecting more than 50 cities across the country. Adif data shows the Spanish rail is more than 4,000km long (2,485 miles).

What we know about Spain's worst rail disaster in over a decade At least 40 people have died and dozens more have been injured after two high-speed trains collided in southern Spain, local authorities have said. The incident near the city of Córdoba has been described by local officials as Spain's worst rail crash in more than a decade. Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez visited the scene on Monday, where he announced a three-day mourning period. Here's what we know about the incident so far. Where did the crash happen? The crash occurred at around 19:45 local time (18:45 GMT) on Sunday, about an hour after one of the trains departed Málaga for Madrid. The train derailed and crossed over to the opposite track, operator Adif said. It then collided with an oncoming train travelling from south Madrid to Huelva, which was forced into an embankment running alongside the track, Spain's Transport Minister Óscar Puente said on Sunday. The majority of those killed and injured were in the front carriages of the Huelva-bound train, he added. What caused the crash? What caused the train to derail remains unclear. Officials say an investigation has been launched but it is not expected to determine what happened for at least a month. Puente has described the crash as "extremely strange" and said all the railway experts consulted by the government "are extremely baffled by the accident". The president of Spain's state-owned rail operator, Renfe, said he had "discarded" the possibility that the incident occured due to excessive speed or human error. Álvaro Fernández Heredia told Spain's national radio RNE that even if a mistake had been made, a system within the train would have fixed it. He added that both trains were travelling under the maximum speed limit on the stretch of track where the crash happened. Fernández Heredia suggested a mechanical fault or an infrastructure issue was a more likely cause. Meanwhile, at a news conference during his visit to Adamuz, Prime Minister Sánchez vowed to uncover the cause of the crash and thanked emergency workers for their help "in a moment of such pain and tragedy". Are people still trapped in the trains? There were around 400 passengers and staff on the two trains, operated by Iryo and Renfe, according to a statement from Renfe. It is not clear if there are people still trapped inside the carriages but rescue teams are on site. "The problem is that the carriages are twisted, so the metal is twisted with the people inside," Francisco Carmona, head of firefighters in Córdoba, told Spanish public broadcaster RTVE. "We have even had to remove a dead person to be able to reach someone alive. It is hard, tricky work," he added. The president of the Andalusian regional government, Juanma Moreno, told local outlet Canal Sur that they are waiting for "heavy machinery" to "practically lift" parts of the second train, which "has taken the worst part of this accident". "Until the heavy machinery can do its job and free the wagons from the track", emergency services will not be able to start "searching and identifying" any remaining victims, he added. Who are the victims? The 39 victims of the crash have not yet been identified, with Puente saying the death toll "is not yet final" as investigations into the crash commence. As of Monday afternoon, 122 people had received medical assistance, 48 of whom remained hospitalised, local emergency services said. Among the 48 victims still in hospital, five are under the age of 18. Moreno said teams are working to identify those who have died. What have the survivors said? Passengers on board the Madrid-bound train described the moment of impact feeling like an "earthquake" and said it shattered the train's windows, displaced luggage and threw people to the floor. "I was in the first carriage. There was a moment when it felt like an earthquake and the train had indeed derailed," journalist Salvador Jimenez told Canal Sur. "There were people screaming, calling for doctors," he added. Another passenger, Lucas Meriako, told Spanish broadcaster La Sexta Noticias he was in the fifth carriage of the same train when he started to "feel some banging" that got louder and louder. "Another train passed us and everything started vibrating. There was a jolt behind us and the feeling that the whole train was going to fall apart," he described.

**Excerpt**

Lawyers for Swiss bar owners condemn 'vindictiveness' after deadly fire The lawyers of the owners of a Swiss bar where a deadly fire broke out on New Year's Eve killing 40 people and injuring 116 have broken their silence to criticise "lies" about their clients. Jessica and Jacques Moretti were "devastated", the lawyers told local media, but denied being aware of any dangers at their venue. "There is a sort of public vindictiveness directed against them," one of the three lawyers, Yaël Hayat, said. Initial findings from the investigation suggest the fire began as sparklers attached to champagne bottles ignited soundproof foaming that lined the ceiling of the basement of Le Constellation bar in the popular ski resort of Crans-Montana. Authorities have acknowledged that the bar had not undergone safety checks for five years. Most of the victims of the fire were young - eight were under the age of 16 - and many are being treated in hospital for severe burns. Many stories about the couple, the venue they managed, as well as their past have circulated in the local media since the fire, increasing pressure on the authorities as they investigate the accident and prosecute the owners. In an interview with Tribune de Geneve, the lawyers said the couple wanted to "restore the truth". Hayat said reports her client Jessica had left the burning building with cash from the register were a lie, telling BFMTV: "In no way did she leave the scene in a hurry; she stayed there to help and support the injured." Patrick Michod, representing Jacques Moretti, said: "When you run an establishment and a tragedy like this occurs, you feel responsible. Now, the major question in this case is the question of criminal responsibility, which is obviously not the same thing as the feelings one may have as the operator." Asked about the foam in the ceiling, Michod said his client obtained the material from a "major construction retailer" which did not disclose that it was flammable. "He did not want to install a highly flammable foam. He wanted to install acoustic foam," he said. Lawyers representing the family of Cyane Panine, a staff member at Le Constellation who died in the blaze, said she had received no safety training and was unaware of the danger posed by the ceiling that caught fire. Hayat described Panine as a close friend of the couple, and pulled out a postcard she said had been written by her to the Morettis, Tribune de Geneve reported. "I hope I will continue to grow alongside you and that we will spend many more New Year's Eves together [...] you are like my second family," the postcard said. The Moretti couple have been accused by authorities of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence. Last week, a Swiss court imposed a travel ban on Jessica Moretti as an alternative to pre-trial detention. She has had to surrender her passport and must report to police every day. She previously told reporters that she was sorry about the "unthinkable tragedy". Jacques Moretti is being held in custody for an initial period of 90 days. Prosecutors have also argued the couple present a flight risk and have asked judges to impose a 400,000-franc bail ($500,000; £374,000)as a condition for their release - 200,000 for each. Michod said that he had filed a request to release Jacques Moretti.

Thirteen schoolchildren killed after bus collides with lorry in South Africa Thirteen school pupils have died in South Africa after the minibus they were travelling in collided with a lorry south of the city of Johannesburg. The crash happened on Monday morning at around 07:00 local time (05:00 GMT) in Vanderbijlpark, the local education authority said. Eleven students died at the scene, while two succumbed to their injuries later on. Two other pupils remains in critical condition. The minibus driver crashed into the lorry after attempting to overtake two vehicles, police spokesperson Mavela Masondo said. Masondo added that a case of culpable homicide would be opened. The minibus driver was "reportedly" being treated in hospital, Gauteng province's department of education said, while the details of what happened to the lorry driver were "uncertain". Fatal road collisions are common in South Africa, due to factors such as rampant speeding, reckless driving and poorly maintained vehicles. In 2025, 11,418 people died in crashes - about 6% lower than a year earlier but still equivalent to an average of 31 deaths a day. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa called Monday's crash "distressing". "Our children are the nation's most precious assets and we must do all we can – from observing the rules of the road to the quality of service providers appointed to transport scholars – to protect learners," the president added.

High-speed train crash in Spain kills at least 39 At least 39 people have died in a train collision in southern Spain and dozens more have been injured in the country's worst rail crash in more than a decade, Spain's Civil Guard has said. Carriages on a Madrid-bound train derailed and crossed over to the opposite tracks, colliding with an oncoming train in Adamuz on Sunday evening. Four hundred passengers and staff were onboard both trains, the rail networks said. Emergency services treated 122 people, with 43, including four children, still in hospital.

Iryo, a private rail company that operated the journey from Málaga, said around 300 passengers were on board the train that first derailed, while the other train – operated by the state-funded firm Renfe – had around 100 passengers. The official cause is not yet known. An investigation is not expected to determine what happened for at least a month, according to the transport minister. Spain's Prime Minister, Pedro Sánchez, said the country will endure a "night of deep pain". The mayor of Adamuz, Rafael Moreno, was one of the first people on the scene of the accident, describing it as "a nightmare". King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia said they were following news of the disaster "with great concern". "We extend our most heartfelt condolences to the relatives and loved ones of the dead, as well as our love and wishes for a swift recovery to the injured," the royal palace said on X. The emergency agency in the region of Andalusia urged any crash survivors to contact their families or post on social media that they are alive. Advanced medical posts were set up for impacted passengers to be treated for injuries and transferred to hospital. Adif said it set up spaces for relatives of the victims at Atocha, Seville, Córdoba, Málaga and Huelva stations. The Spanish Red Cross has deployed emergency support services to the scene, while also offering counselling to families nearby. Miguel Ángel Rodríguez from the Red Cross told RNE radio: "The families are going through a situation of great anxiety due to the lack of information. These are very distressing moments." French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen have published statements offering condolences. "My thoughts are with the victims, their families and the entire Spanish people. France stands by your side," Macron wrote on social media.

Ghana arrests Nigerians accused of running cyber-crime networks Ghana's security forces have arrested nine Nigerians suspected of co-ordinating a host of cyber-crime activities from makeshift offices in and around the capital, Accra. Forty-four others, believed to be victims brought to Ghana from Nigeria under false pretences, have also been detained and handed over to the immigration authority. During the two-day intelligence-led operation, raids uncovered 62 laptops, 52 mobile phones and two pump-action guns, the authorities have said. There is a growing trend of foreigners being lured to Ghana under the pretext of lucrative work. They are then put in gated compounds, have their documents confiscated and are compelled to engage in cyber-crime. They often work on romance scams, where a victim is encouraged to send money to a fictitious partner who they believe is real, or business email compromise, where someone poses as an employer and gets people to sends funds or sensitive data. The weekend's operation was jointly co-ordinated by a host of agencies, including the Cyber Security Authority (CSA). ''All the arrested individuals have been duly profiled and handed over to the Ghana Immigration Service for safekeeping and further investigations," Communications Minister Sam George said in a post on X. "We caution foreign nationals invited to Ghana to verify claims made by their fellow nationals to lure them here.'' George also indicated that suspects arrested in previous recent operations have been handed over to Nigerian law enforcement or are facing prosecution. The CSA and other agencies have been making efforts to flush out cyber-criminals, including working with the US authorities to arrest high-profile suspects. Among recent operations was the arrest of a popular Ghanaian social media influencer known as Abu Trica, whose real name is Frederick Kumi, who allegedly stole $8m (£5.9m) from vulnerable Americans through a romance scam. He has not yet commented on the allegations. Another successful operation was the dismantling of a syndicate that defrauded over 200 victims of $400,000 (£300,000).

US believes its power matters more than international law, UN chief tells BBC The US is acting with impunity and believes its power matters more than international law, the head of the UN has told the BBC. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, António Guterres said Washington's "clear conviction" was that multilateral solutions were irrelevant. What mattered, he continued, was the "exercise of the power and influence of the United States and sometimes in this respect by the norms of international law". His comments come weeks after the US struck Venezuela and seized its president - and in the context of Donald Trump's repeated threats to annex Greenland. Guterres said he believed the founding principles of the UN - including the equality of member states - were now under threat. President Trump has previously been scathing in his criticism of the United Nations. He used his address at last September's General Assembly to question its very purpose, claiming he had "ended seven unendable wars" on his own and the UN "did not even try to help in any of them". "Later I realised that the UN wasn't there for us," he said. Presented with this damning assessment, Guterres admitted his organisation was struggling to make members abide by the international laws laid out in the UN Charter. The UN was "extremely engaged" in solving major global conflicts, he insisted. "But the UN has no leverage - the big powers have stronger leverage. He questioned whether that extra leverage was being used to produce real and enduring solutions to those conflicts, or just quick fixes. "There is a big difference between the two things," he noted. Guterres also said his organisation needed reform to tackle "dramatic problems and challenges" facing its 193 members. "There are those that believe the power of law should be replaced by the law of power," the UN chief said. "Indeed, when one sees the present policy of the United States, there is a clear conviction that multilateral solutions are not relevant and that what matters is the exercise of the power and the influence of the United States and sometimes in this respect by the norms of international law". He suggested the UN Security Council - designed to maintain international peace and security - no longer represented the world and was "ineffective". Any one of the council's permanent members - France, China, Russia, the UK or US - can currently veto resolutions. Both Russia and the US have used this power to frustrate global efforts to end the wars in Ukraine and Gaza. Guterres claimed vetoes were being used to further individual members' interests, and criticised the fact that "three European countries" were permanent members. He called for changes to the council's composition - to "regain legitimacy" and "give voice to the whole world" - and to limit veto powers to avoid unacceptable "blockages". Guterres – a former Portuguese prime minister – took on the job of heading the UN in 2017, and will leave the role at the end of this year. In his annual remarks to the General Assembly, traditionally used to identify the organisation's priorities, he warned of a world in chaos, "brimming with conflict, impunity, inequality and unpredictability", and identified "brazen violations of international law" as one of the biggest challenges facing the global order. One of the ongoing conflicts Guterres identified as key for the UN was Gaza. For large parts of the war it was prevented from distributing aid in the strip, as Israel blocked international humanitarian organisations from bringing it into the territory. At one point, Israel even backed an external contractor – the Gaza Humanitarian Organisation – to do the work the UN had traditionally carried out for decades. Hundreds of Palestinians were killed trying to access food at GHF sites. When asked if he saw the UN as powerless in Gaza where it should have made a difference, he said: "Of course, but let's be clear. "For a long time, Israel was saying that humanitarian aid was not distributed because the UN was not able to do so. Of course, whenever Israel would not allow us to move into Gaza, we couldn't move into Gaza. And then there was a ceasefire, and a massive flow of humanitarian aid." He stressed: "We were ready, provided we had the conditions." A few days ago, Guterres told the UN General Assembly that "1945 problem-solving" wouldn't solve 2026 problems, referring to the organisation's founding structure. The challenges keep coming, with the US-forced change of leadership in Venezuela, regime forces in Iran killing thousands of protestors and Donald Trump's stated aim of annexing Greenland. Questions about the death of multilateralism - and the failure of some world leaders to speak out and defend the rule of international law - are growing ever-louder. But Antonio Guterres told me he was remaining positive. "I think that people are sometimes reluctant to confront the powerful. But the truth is that if we don't confront the powerful, we will never be able to have a better world."

### 11. [Japan PM Takaichi calls snap election three months after taking office](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1dk0x0v6pdo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

Japan PM Takaichi calls snap election three months after taking office Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi will dissolve parliament on Friday, paving the way for an early election on 8 February that she hopes will translate her strong public polling into a big majority in the lower house. It was an "extremely weighty decision" that would "determine Japan's course together with the people", Takaichi told a news conference in Tokyo. The country's first female leader and her cabinet have enjoyed high public support since taking office last October. But her party lags behind in polls and the move is risky. It's Japan's second general election in as many years and will test appetite for her plans to boost public spending when cost-of-living is top of voters' minds. Having been elected as prime minister by lawmakers on 21 October, Takaichi is now seeking a public mandate in the House of Representatives, the more powerful house in Japan. Since the day she took office, Takaichi said, she has been "constantly concerned that the Takaichi cabinet has not yet been tested in an election where the public chooses the government". "Is Sanae Takaichi fit to be prime minister? I wanted to ask the sovereign people to decide," she told the news conference. Campaigning for the vote to elect the 465 lower house MPs, who serve four-year terms, starts on 27 January. Her Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has governed Japan almost continuously since 1955. It currently has 199 seats - including three held by its independent partners - in the House of Representatives, the most of any party. The LDP's coalition with the Japan Innovation party gives it a fragile majority, with just enough seats to govern. A protege of former conservative PM Shinzo Abe and self-professed admirer of Margaret Thatcher, Takaichi is known as Japan's "Iron Lady". She came into office promising an economic upturn after years of stagnation. Takaichi is an advocate of heavy government-led spending to drive economic growth - a revival of the sort of stimulus measures that Japan saw under "Abenomics". Her first few months in office have seen soaring personal poll ratings - no Japanese PM has been popular since Abe, in 2012. In December, her cabinet approved a record defence budget of nine trillion yen ($57bn; £43bn). This comes amid growing concern over China, with Tokyo describing its neighbour's military activities in the region as its "greatest strategic challenge". Takaichi has found herself the target of China's ire since last November, when she made comments suggesting that Japan could respond with its own self-defence force if China attacked Taiwan. The diplomatic spat that ensued has sent bilateral ties plunging to their lowest point in more than a decade. Meanwhile, Takaichi has pursued closer ties with the US. During US President Donald Trump's visit to Japan last October, the two leaders heaped praise on each other and signed a deal on rare earths. They also signed a document heralding a new "golden age" of US-Japan relations. Opinion polls show that while the LDP remains broadly unpopular among Japanese residents, Takaichi and her government have charted approval ratings of 60-80%. This popularity is what Takaichi hopes can help the LDP secure a "sole majority" in parliament and push through bolder policies more easily, Dr Seijiro Takeshita, a management professor at the University of Shizuoka, told the BBC World Service's Asia Specific podcast. "She wants to solidify her position to make things smoother at a later stage," Takeshita said. But the snap election gamble comes with its own set of risks. The LDP's leadership has been on shaky ground, and Takaichi is the country's fourth PM in five years. Her predecessors' terms were cut short by falling public support and scandals. Her immediate predecessor, Shigeru Ishiba, also announced a snap election shortly after taking office - leading to one of the LDP's worst ever results and costing the party its majority in the House of Representatives. Another challenge looms in the form of a new, consolidated opposition, the Centrist Reform Alliance, which was formed last week by Japan's largest opposition party, the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, and the Komeito party, the LDP's former coalition partner. Takaichi said the dissolution of parliament was being carried out only "after establishing a thorough system" which ensures there is no disruption to economic policies affecting livelihoods and rising prices. What Takaichi is hoping for is that "people will trust her to deliver on her promises", Dr Jeffrey Kingston, an Asian studies professor at Temple University in the US, told the BBC. Her high approval ratings are "only going to decline so she wants to lock in the benefits of a long honeymoon", he added.

### 12. [IMF warns of trade tension risk to global growth](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0r47ey0d1vo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

IMF warns of trade tension risk to global growth Trade tensions and a reversal in the artificial intelligence (AI) boom are among the main risks to global economic growth, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned. Its comments came in its latest world economic outlook, where it described the global economy as "steady", with growth expected to remain "resilient" this year. The IMF's forecast was produced ahead of Donald Trump's threat at the weekend to impose tariffs on eight European countries opposed to his proposed takeover of Greenland. The fund also said the independence of central banks was "paramount" for global economic stability and growth. The economic watchdog said global growth was projected to reach 3.3% this year - an increase from its previous forecast of 3.1% - before slowing slightly to 3.2% in 2027. Speaking to the BBC, IMF chief economist Pierre Olivier Gourinchas said: "We have a picture of a global economy that is growing at - it's not outsized growth rates but it's quite resilient, quite robust. "In a sense the global economy has been shaking off the trade disruptions of 2025, and it's coming out ahead of what we were expecting." He said while the effects of Trumps' tariffs has been "definitely to slow down global activity", he added that there "have been other things that have been more than offsetting". The IMF's report says the global economy has been helped by "tailwinds from surging investment related to technology, including artificial intelligence (AI)". However, it said risks to the global outlook "remain tilted to the downside", warning that if expectations about AI growth turn out to be overly optimistic an abrupt market correction could be triggered. Even a relatively mild market correction could have an impact, Gourinchas said, given how much share price gains have contributed to wealth gains in recent years. Other risks are emerging as firms increasingly take on debt to make AI investments. "It doesn't take as much of a market reaction to have an impact on people's wealth relative to their income so that they start cutting consumption, [businesses start] changing their investment plans etc, so there could be some vulnerability there," he said. As well as an end to the AI boom, another possible risk highlighted by the IMF was that "trade tensions could flare up, prolonging uncertainty and weighing more heavily on activity". "Domestic political tensions or geopolitical tensions could erupt, introducing new layers of uncertainty and disrupting the global economy through their impact on financial markets, supply chains, and commodity prices." The IMF estimates the UK grew by 1.4% in 2025, slightly up from its previous projection of 1.3%. Its forecast for this year remains unchanged at 1.3%, which would make it the third fastest growing economy in the G7 behind the US and Canada. It predicts 1.5% growth in 2027. Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the IMF had upgraded the UK's growth for the third time since April 2025, and the country was "on course to be the fastest growing European G7 economy this year and next". But shadow chancellor Sir Mel Stride said: "A 0.1% uptick is not a triumph and the fact Rachel Reeves is celebrating it shows how desperate she has become." The IMF expects global inflation to fall from an estimated 4.1% in 2025 to 3.8% in 2026 and further to 3.4% the following year. In the UK, Gourinchas said price changes in regulated industries, such as transport and energy, had kept inflation elevated last year but "that's going to fade away". The IMF expects UK inflation to return to the 2% target by the end of the year, as a weakening labour market continues to keep wage growth down. The IMF warned that central bank independence was "paramount for macroeconomic stability and economic growth". "Preserving the independence of central banks, both legal and operational, remains critical for avoiding the risk of fiscal dominance, anchoring inflation expectations, and enabling them to achieve their mandates," it said. It comes a week after US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said he was the subject of an "unprecedented" US justice department criminal investigation over his testimony about the bank's building renovations. He said he believed this was due to Donald Trump's anger over the Fed not cutting interest rates, but Trump said he did not know about the investigation. Powell's comments prompted central bank heads across the world to declare "full solidarity" with the US Fed chief, while three former heads of the bank strongly criticised the investigation. Gourinchas said preserving central bank independence would be key to economic success in the years ahead. Without it, he warned, "the economic environment deteriorates pretty rapidly". Gourinchas said challenges to central bank independence had emerged elsewhere, particularly in countries with big borrowing needs, as leaders are enticed by the idea that lower interest rates would make it less expensive to fund government spending. But he warned those dynamics tend to lead to inflation and higher borrowing costs over time. "The evidence is very clear. It's self defeating," he said.

**Excerpt**

China's birth rate hits record low as population continues to shrink China's birth rates sunk to a record low in 2025, despite the government rolling out a spate of incentives to boost it, as the country's population fell for the fourth straight year. Government data on Monday showed that the country's birth rate fell to 5.63 per 1,000 people – a record low since the Communist Party took power in 1949 – while its death rate rose to 8.04 per 1,000 people, the highest since 1968. Its population fell 3.39 million to reach 1.4 billion by the end of 2025, marking a quicker decline than the previous year. Faced with an ageing population and sluggish economy, Beijing has been trying hard to encourage more young people to marry and have children. In 2016, it scrapped its longstanding one-child policy and replaced it with a two-child limit. When that did not lead to a sustained upsurge in births, authorities announced that they would allow up to three children per couple in 2021. More recently, China has offered parents 3,600 yuan (£375; $500) per each of their children under the age of three. Certain provinces are also dishing out their own baby bonuses, including additional payouts and extended maternity leave. Some of these incentives have stirred controversy. For instance, a new 13% tax on contraceptives - including condoms, birth control pills and devices - has sparked concern about unwanted pregnancies and HIV rates. China has one of the lowest fertility rates in the world, at around one birth per woman, below the replacement rate of 2.1. Other economies in the region, such as South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan, have similarly low fertility rates. China is also one of the most expensive countries in which to raise a child, according to a 2024 report by the YuWa Population Research Institute in Beijing. But some Chinese people have told the BBC they are hindered by other factors - including the desire for a carefree life without constantly worrying about their children. "I have very few peers who have children, and if they do, they're obsessed about getting the best nanny or enrolling the kids in the best schools. It sounds exhausting," a Beijing resident told the BBC in 2021. Experts at the United Nations believe China's population will continue on a downward trajectory, estimating that the nation will lose more than half of its current population by 2100. A shrinking population has economic and social implications for the world's second-largest economy: exacerbating an already declining workforce and weak consumer sentiment. With many young people moving away from their parents, there is also a growing number of seniors who are being left to look after themselves or rely on government payments. But the pension pot is running dry, according to the state-run Chinese Academy of Social Sciences - and the country is running out of time to build enough funds to care for its growing elderly population.
