US believes its power matters more than international law, UN chief tells BBC The US is acting with impunity and believes its power matters more than international law, the head of the UN has told the BBC. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, António Guterres said Washington's "clear conviction" was that multilateral solutions were irrelevant. What mattered, he continued, was the "exercise of the power and influence of the United States and sometimes in this respect by the norms of international law". His comments come weeks after the US struck Venezuela and seized its president - and in the context of Donald Trump's repeated threats to annex Greenland. Guterres said he believed the founding principles of the UN - including the equality of member states - were now under threat. President Trump has previously been scathing in his criticism of the United Nations. He used his address at last September's General Assembly to question its very purpose, claiming he had "ended seven unendable wars" on his own and the UN "did not even try to help in any of them". "Later I realised that the UN wasn't there for us," he said. Presented with this damning assessment, Guterres admitted his organisation was struggling to make members abide by the international laws laid out in the UN Charter. The UN was "extremely engaged" in solving major global conflicts, he insisted. "But the UN has no leverage - the big powers have stronger leverage. He questioned whether that extra leverage was being used to produce real and enduring solutions to those conflicts, or just quick fixes. "There is a big difference between the two things," he noted. Guterres also said his organisation needed reform to tackle "dramatic problems and challenges" facing its 193 members. "There are those that believe the power of law should be replaced by the law of power," the UN chief said. "Indeed, when one sees the present policy of the United States, there is a clear conviction that multilateral solutions are not relevant and that what matters is the exercise of the power and the influence of the United States and sometimes in this respect by the norms of international law". He suggested the UN Security Council - designed to maintain international peace and security - no longer represented the world and was "ineffective". Any one of the council's permanent members - France, China, Russia, the UK or US - can currently veto resolutions. Both Russia and the US have used this power to frustrate global efforts to end the wars in Ukraine and Gaza. Guterres claimed vetoes were being used to further individual members' interests, and criticised the fact that "three European countries" were permanent members. He called for changes to the council's composition - to "regain legitimacy" and "give voice to the whole world" - and to limit veto powers to avoid unacceptable "blockages". Guterres – a former Portuguese prime minister – took on the job of heading the UN in 2017, and will leave the role at the end of this year. In his annual remarks to the General Assembly, traditionally used to identify the organisation's priorities, he warned of a world in chaos, "brimming with conflict, impunity, inequality and unpredictability", and identified "brazen violations of international law" as one of the biggest challenges facing the global order. One of the ongoing conflicts Guterres identified as key for the UN was Gaza. For large parts of the war it was prevented from distributing aid in the strip, as Israel blocked international humanitarian organisations from bringing it into the territory. At one point, Israel even backed an external contractor – the Gaza Humanitarian Organisation – to do the work the UN had traditionally carried out for decades. Hundreds of Palestinians were killed trying to access food at GHF sites. When asked if he saw the UN as powerless in Gaza where it should have made a difference, he said: "Of course, but let's be clear. "For a long time, Israel was saying that humanitarian aid was not distributed because the UN was not able to do so. Of course, whenever Israel would not allow us to move into Gaza, we couldn't move into Gaza. And then there was a ceasefire, and a massive flow of humanitarian aid." He stressed: "We were ready, provided we had the conditions." A few days ago, Guterres told the UN General Assembly that "1945 problem-solving" wouldn't solve 2026 problems, referring to the organisation's founding structure. The challenges keep coming, with the US-forced change of leadership in Venezuela, regime forces in Iran killing thousands of protestors and Donald Trump's stated aim of annexing Greenland. Questions about the death of multilateralism - and the failure of some world leaders to speak out and defend the rule of international law - are growing ever-louder. But Antonio Guterres told me he was remaining positive. "I think that people are sometimes reluctant to confront the powerful. But the truth is that if we don't confront the powerful, we will never be able to have a better world."

### 2. [China's birth rate hits record low as population continues to shrink](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c79r7v7qr53o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

China's birth rate hits record low as population continues to shrink China's birth rates sunk to a record low in 2025, despite the government rolling out a spate of incentives to boost it, as the country's population fell for the fourth straight year. Government data on Monday showed that the country's birth rate fell to 5.63 per 1,000 people – a record low since the Communist Party took power in 1949 – while its death rate rose to 8.04 per 1,000 people, the highest since 1968. Its population fell 3.39 million to reach 1.4 billion by the end of 2025, marking a quicker decline than the previous year. Faced with an ageing population and sluggish economy, Beijing has been trying hard to encourage more young people to marry and have children. In 2016, it scrapped its longstanding one-child policy and replaced it with a two-child limit. When that did not lead to a sustained upsurge in births, authorities announced that they would allow up to three children per couple in 2021. More recently, China has offered parents 3,600 yuan (£375; $500) per each of their children under the age of three. Certain provinces are also dishing out their own baby bonuses, including additional payouts and extended maternity leave. Some of these incentives have stirred controversy. For instance, a new 13% tax on contraceptives - including condoms, birth control pills and devices - has sparked concern about unwanted pregnancies and HIV rates. China has one of the lowest fertility rates in the world, at around one birth per woman, below the replacement rate of 2.1. Other economies in the region, such as South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan, have similarly low fertility rates. China is also one of the most expensive countries in which to raise a child, according to a 2024 report by the YuWa Population Research Institute in Beijing. But some Chinese people have told the BBC they are hindered by other factors - including the desire for a carefree life without constantly worrying about their children. "I have very few peers who have children, and if they do, they're obsessed about getting the best nanny or enrolling the kids in the best schools. It sounds exhausting," a Beijing resident told the BBC in 2021. Experts at the United Nations believe China's population will continue on a downward trajectory, estimating that the nation will lose more than half of its current population by 2100. A shrinking population has economic and social implications for the world's second-largest economy: exacerbating an already declining workforce and weak consumer sentiment. With many young people moving away from their parents, there is also a growing number of seniors who are being left to look after themselves or rely on government payments. But the pension pot is running dry, according to the state-run Chinese Academy of Social Sciences - and the country is running out of time to build enough funds to care for its growing elderly population.

### 3. [Around 1,500 US soldiers on standby for deployment to Minneapolis, officials say](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c74v0pxg2nvo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

Around 1,500 US soldiers on standby for deployment to Minneapolis, officials say Soldiers are on standby for possible deployment to Minneapolis, a US defence official has told CBS News, the BBC's US partner. The official said the 1,500 soldiers, currently in Alaska, are an option for US President Donald Trump if he decided to use active duty military personnel, as anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) demonstrations continued in the city on Saturday. No decision has yet been made on whether to deploy the soldiers from Alaska, the official said. Minnesota officials have urged protesters to stay orderly and peaceful during demonstrations after an ICE agent shot dead US citizen Renee Good earlier this month. The soldiers are part of the 11th Airborne Division in Fort Wainwright, the official added. In a Sunday interview on CBS Face the Nation, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey condemned Trump's threat to send more troops into the city, saying the existing presence of federal ICE agents is already an "occupying force that has quite literally invaded our city". "You can go through whatever rhetorical flourish you want, but when you have 3,000 ICE agents and border control come to the city, when you've got this supposed threat of 1,500 military coming to the city, yeah, that's very much what it feels like," Frey said. Last week, Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act, a rarely used law that allows active-duty military personnel to be deployed for law enforcement duties inside the US. It comes as a US federal judge issued an order limiting the crowd control tactics that can be used by ICE agents towards "peaceful and unobstructive" protesters in Minneapolis. On Friday, Judge Katherine Menendez ruled that federal agents cannot arrest or pepper spray peaceful demonstrations, including those monitoring or observing ICE agents. But Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a Sunday interview on CBS's Face the Nation that the judge's ruling is "a little ridiculous" because it "didn't change anything". "We only use those chemical agents when there's violence happening and perpetuating and you need to be able to establish law and order to keep people safe," Noem said. "So that judge's order didn't change anything for how we're operating on the ground, because it's basically telling us to do what we've already been doing." The state's National Guard has been mobilised and placed on alert by Governor Tim Walz, and other law enforcement officers were deployed to Minneapolis ahead of the anti-ICE demonstrations. Recent protests in the city were sparked by widespread action by ICE in the city, and follow Good's death on 7 January. City leaders said Good was there as a legal observer of ICE activity. But the Trump administration has called her a "domestic terrorist". Good's death sparked protests across the country, with many people holding signs that read "Justice for Renee".

### 4. [Israel pushes back on Trump's picks for executives on Gaza 'Board of Peace'](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd0y453yd90o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

Israel pushes back on Trump's picks for executives on Gaza 'Board of Peace' Israel's leader Benjamin Netanyahu has convened a meeting with his top advisers to discuss US President Donald Trump's "Board of Peace" for Gaza, after Israel said it was not included in talks about the makeup of one of the board's lower bodies. The US on Saturday named the first members of the Gaza Executive Board - including Turkey's foreign minister, a Qatari official, former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Netanyahu's office has since said this was "not coordinated with Israel and runs contrary to its policy". The Board of Peace is part of Trump's 20-point plan to end the Israel-Hamas war and is expected to temporarily oversee the running of Gaza. The exact structure of the board, which will also manage Gaza's reconstruction, remains unclear and members are still being invited. The "Gaza Executive Board" will be responsible for overseeing all on-the-ground work of yet another administrative group, the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG), according to a statement released by the White House. A second body, the "founding Executive Board" - which also includes Kushner and Blair - will have a high-level focus on investment and diplomacy. So far, the only Israeli member on the Gaza Executive Board is Yakir Gabay, a businessman born in Israel and now based in Cyprus. There are no Palestinians on either senior board. Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir wrote on X: "The Gaza Strip does not need any "administrative committee" to oversee its "rehabilitation" - it needs to be cleansed of Hamas terrorists". Israel's opposition leader Yair Lapid called the announcement a "diplomatic failure for Israel." Officials from Qatar and Turkey, which have both been critical of Israel's military actions in Gaza, are confirmed members of the advisory panel. The overarching Board of Peace will be made up of world leaders, with President Trump as its chairman, the White House said. While those members have not been announced, the leaders of the UK, Hungary, Argentina, Jordan, Turkey, India, and Egypt have reportedly been invited. Governments have reacted cautiously to the invitations, with only Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, a Trump ally, confirming he has accepted the role. The White House said those chosen will work to ensure "effective governance and the delivery of best-in-class services that advance peace, stability, and prosperity for the people of Gaza". The UK was seeking more clarity on the committee, a government source told the BBC. On Saturday, Bloomberg reported that Trump was asking countries to contribute $1bn (£745m) to join the panel. Speaking to CBS news, a US official confirmed the reports, but clarified that countries could still join on a three year membership without paying anything. Canada's Mark Carney said that he agreed with Trump's plan on principle, but that the details - including financial ones - were still being worked through. Speaking to reporters in Doha on Sunday, he made clear that Canada did not have "unimpeded" aid funds to cover the costs of membership. Meanwhile, the United Nations warned on Saturday that the humanitarian crisis in Gaza is "far from over". The UN estimates around 80% of buildings in Gaza have been destroyed or damaged and families who have survived the war are now struggling with the winter weather, and a lack of food and shelter. Olga Cherevko from the UN aid coordination office said that the delivery of tonnes of aid and the fixing of roads in the months since a ceasefire came into effect were a "band aid" rather than a solution. Bitter winter weather has led to further complications, destroying buildings and making it difficult to access healthcare. Israel says that it is facilitating humanitarian assistance, and has blamed the UN for failing to distribute supplies already in Gaza. It argues any restrictions are designed to stop Hamas infiltrating and exploiting relief efforts.
