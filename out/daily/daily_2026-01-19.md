Trump tests boundaries of his power as Minnesota pushes back With 1,500 troops reportedly on standby to deploy to Minnesota, tensions are rising in the state as protests continue against Donald Trump's immigration crackdown. US officials say they are targeting the "worst of the worst" but critics warn migrants with no criminal record and US citizens are being detained, too. "It could be anybody," says Sunshine, as she drives around her neighbourhood, St Paul - one of the so-called Twin Cities, along with Minneapolis. Snow and ice swirl over the tarmac in the bitter wind. Sunshine is not her real name - she has asked to use a pseudonym because of fears she could be targeted for her actions. "I have decided for my own safety to give them more space," she says, referring to the unmarked patrol cars ahead, driven by the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents she is trying to track. Each day, residents in loosely organised groups drive around their neighbourhoods trying to spot ICE agents and film them, they say, to hold them to account. "I, we, have the legal right to drive on the streets of our own city and we have the legal rights to observe [the ICE agents], but they seem to have forgotten that," Sunshine says. The streets of Minneapolis feel like a battle of wills between a Republican president pressing the boundaries of his power and a Democratic city and state pushing back. This week as the temperature plummeted, protests intensified against ICE agents outside the federal building hosting them. Minnesota officials have urged protesters to stay orderly and peaceful, and local officials have said the majority have stayed trouble-free. But at times there have been clashes, with the authorities deploying tear gas and pepper balls to disperse crowds. On Friday, a US federal judge issued an order limiting the crowd control tactics that can be used by ICE agents toward peaceful protesters in Minneapolis. Judge Katherine Menendez said federal agents cannot arrest or pepper spray peaceful demonstrators, including those monitoring or observing ICE agents. Trump has vowed to press on with his mass deportation drive in Minnesota, with thousands of federal agents deployed to the state. Many of them were sent in the aftermath of the fatal shooting of Minneapolis woman, Renée Good, 37, by an ICE agent on 7 January. The circumstances surrounding her death remain contested, with the Trump administration saying the ICE agent who shot her acted in self-defence, while local officials argue the woman was attempting to leave and posed no danger. The FBI is investigating the shooting, but officials in Minnesota say they have been denied access to evidence. Good's killing has focused the minds of many members of this community who are determined to reverse Trump's campaign. In her car, Sunshine spots two unmarked vehicles with darkened windows containing ICE agents. We follow them to a nearby neighbourhood, where the two cars proceed to drive slowly and repeatedly around the block in circles, in what is seemingly a diversion tactic to take Sunshine away from a shopping centre immigrants often use. "This is the game. But if they're doing this with me, they're not putting their hands on someone," she says. "So, yes, it's gas money and it's my time and I'm okay with that." The week after Good's death there was a second shooting involving a federal officer in Minneapolis. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said an officer shot a man in the leg in Minneapolis after being attacked with a shovel as he tried to make an arrest of a Venezuelan migrant who entered the US illegally. After the incident, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the agent was "beat up" and "bruised", adding ICE officers were "following protocols that we have used for years" from before the Trump administration. The man's family has disputed the DHS' version of events in an interview with the Washington Post, saying he was shot in the doorway and not during a scuffle in the street. Minneapolis is the fifth major city to be targeted in Trump's immigration crackdown after his election pledge for the biggest deportation operation of undocumented migrants in history. The campaign, which remains popular with most Republicans and especially Trump's Make America Great Again (Maga) supporters, has sparked a fierce backlash in the Democrat-led cities where operations are taking place. On Saturday, hundreds of demonstrators confronted and chased away a small group attempting to hold a pro-ICE and anti-Islam rally. Counter-protesters converged on the event organised by far-right activist Jake Lang, who was pardoned by Trump after being charged with crimes related to the US Capitol riots on 6 January 2021. Lang had vowed to burn a Quran outside City Hall, however it is not clear if he carried out his plan. Minnesota is home to the largest community of Somali immigrants in the US, the majority of whom are US citizens. The president has said they should "go back to where they came from" and described the community as "garbage". He launched the immigration crackdown in December after some Somali immigrants were convicted in a massive fraud of state welfare programmes. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz recently said he would end his bid for re-election amid the fraud scandal. But he has accused Trump and his allies of seeking to take advantage of the crisis to play politics. Against this backdrop, Trump has threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act, a 19th Century law that allows active-duty military personnel to be deployed for law enforcement within the US, to quell the city's resistance to his immigration campaign. On Friday the Justice Department opened a criminal probe into the Democrats Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, accusing them of attempting to impede federal immigration operations. Walz said the move was "weaponising the justice system against your opponents". In a post on social media, Trump called protesters in the city "traitors, troublemakers and insurrectionists" and accused them of being "in many cases, highly paid professionals". In response to this characterisation, Sunshine says: "I'm definitely not being paid. "I think that I'm doing what I'm doing because I love my neighbours and watching them being racially profiled in the streets of our own our city." She adds: "We have to protect one another." Federal agents have been accused of racial profiling by observers, something the Trump administration denies. Near a Mexican restaurant, we stop the car and another observer who calls herself Misko gets out of her car, heading towards Sunshine, visibly distressed. The two women embrace. Misko is struggling for breath as she recounts what just happened. "Just around the corner. Two of them blocked me in, then they came out. [One agent] had an assault rifle. He was pounding on my window," she says. DHS officials did not respond to questions from the BBC about the incident. Despite the encounter, Misko later tells me she won't be deterred. With the president also renewing his threat to send in troops, Minneapolis feels in the grip of a deepening crisis, and no-one seems prepared to slow it down.

**Excerpt**

Factory explosion in China kills two, injures 84 A huge explosion at a factory in northern China has killed two people and injured 84 others, with five people still missing, state media reported. The blast happened at around 15:00 local time (07:00 GMT) Sunday at Baogang United Steel plant in Inner Mongolia, causing noticeable tremors in the area. Footage online showed the explosion sending large plumes of smoke into the sky, while the ground was littered with debris, including collapsed ceilings and pipes. Five among the dozens hospitalised suffered serious injuries, state media reported. Authorities are investigating the cause of the blast. Baogang United Steel is a major state-owned iron and steel enterprise. China has a long history of industrial accidents, from factory explosions and mine collapses to mudslides. In 2015, two massive explosions in the port of Tianjin killed 173 people, leaving hundreds more injured and devastating large areas of the city. In May last year, an explosion in a chemical plant in the eastern province of Shandong killed five people and injured at least 19. The blast ripped the windows of building nearby from their hinges.

### 3. [Fears Iran's internet shutdown could lead to 'extreme digital isolation'](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg5gegrdq3go?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

Fears Iran's internet shutdown could lead to 'extreme digital isolation' Iran is 10 days into one of the most extreme internet shutdowns in history, with 92 million citizens cut off from all internet services and even disruption to phone and text messaging. The Iranian government cut off services on 8 January, apparently to stifle dissent and prevent international scrutiny of a government crack down on protesters. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said the internet was cut off in response to what he described as externally directed "terrorist operations". The government has not said when internet services will return, but new reports suggest that, behind the scenes, the authorities may be making plans to restrict it permanently. On 15 January, the news website IranWire reported that government spokesperson Fatemeh Mohajerani told journalists that international web access will not be available until at least the Iranian New Year in late March. Internet freedom observers at FilterWatch believe the government is hastily implementing new systems and rules to cut Iran off from the international internet. "There should be no expectation of reopening international internet access, and even afterwards, users' access to international internet will never return to its previous form," FilterWatch said, citing unnamed government sources. While the BBC cannot independently verify this report or the timing of its implementation, journalists who spoke to BBC Persian also said they were told that internet access would not be restored anytime soon. From temporary outage to "communication black hole" Iran has maintained a tight grip over the internet for many years, with most western social media apps and platforms blocked, as well as external news websites like BBC News. However many people have managed to access popular apps such as Instagram using Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). Internet freedom campaigners at Access Now say Iran has consistently used shutdowns as a way to mask mass violence and brutal crackdowns on protesters, as seen during the nationwide internet shutdowns during the November 2019 and September 2022 protests. A shutdown was also imposed during the Iran-Israel conflict in June 2025. However, the current blackout has lasted longer than any previous shutdown. In a public statement, the charity Access Now said that full restoration of internet access is imperative. "Restricting access to these essential services not only endanger lives but embolden authorities to conceal and evade accountability for human rights abuses," it said. Already there are reports that livelihoods in Iran are being badly impacted by the shutdown with e-commerce particularly affected. As of 18 January, the Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) estimates that more than 3,300 confirmed protester deaths have been recorded, with more than 4,380 cases under review. It also reports that the number of arrests has reached 24,266 across 187 cities. The real number of people killed and detained is believed to be significantly higher, but the lack of access means the figures cannot be independently verified. Internet monitoring project, FilterWatch, says that the latest shutdown spells the start of a more extreme "digital isolation" and increased surveillance on what is said, sent and viewed online. Amir Rashidi, director of cyber security and digital rights at the Miaan Group, which runs FilterWatch, told the BBC he believes the authorities are moving towards a tiered system in which access to the global internet would no longer be automatic but subject to approval. Access would be granted through a registration and vetting process, he expects, adding that the technical infrastructure for such a system has been in place for years. Who decides about the Internet? According to FilterWatch, the plans are not being spoken about publicly, with key decisions increasingly concentrated within security bodies rather than civilian ministries. Protecting Iran from cyber attacks - of which there have been many high profile and disruptive cases in recent years - may be another motivation for the extreme moves. However, analysts caution that the plans may not fully materialise or could be applied unevenly due to internal power dynamics and broader economic and technical pressures. Amir Rashidi notes that risks to internet providers, alongside users' ability to adapt or migrate to alternative platforms, could further complicate implementation. If Iran goes ahead with the plans being reported on, it will be following similar systems in Russia and China. China has led the world on internet control not just with enormous state censorship over online discussion but also with what people are able to access abroad. The so-called Great Chinese Firewall blocks citizens from much of the global internet and all western apps like Facebook, Instagram and YouTube are not reachable without VPNs - but they are also becoming harder to use. In 2019, Russia began testing for a grand plan to create a similar system dubbed Ru-net. But unlike China, which built state control into the internet as the web spread decades ago, Russia is having to retrofit state control into complex systems. Russia is going a step further than China and planning to switch itself off from the world wide web with a "kill switch", which will apparently be used at times of crisis. The system will allow internal internet traffic and keep the country moving online but without traffic going outside or in - a digital border in effect. But it has yet to be fully tested. Where is internet in Iran heading? If the reports are accurate, it seems that Iran is planning to a quasi combination of permanent Chinese and Russian internet control. "In Iran there seems to be a move to isolate everyone from any electronic access, unless approved by the government," said computer security expert Prof Alan Woodward from Surrey University in the UK, after reviewing the reports of Iran's plans. He believes the Iranian regime has probably moved ahead with its longer term plans, using the current blackout as a reason to make the technical switches and orders now, whilst everything is cut off. Amir Rashidi says the question is no longer technical, but political - arguing that whether such systems are fully implemented now depends on political will. Starlink and other internet-from-space services, known as Low Earth Orbit (LEO), have also complicated control for Iran during the protests. LEO internet services allow users to get around all censorship and shutdowns by connecting via satellites. The government was able to jam and interfere with some Starlink users but it has been confirmed to the BBC that other terminals remain operational after the company updated its firmware to bypass government blocking efforts. The service, which is owned by Elon Musk, also waived subscription fees for Iranian users. In spite of the increasing tools being used by repressive regimes, Woodward is surprisingly optimistic about the future of internet. He cites advances in LEO and the fact that many phones can now use satellites even when the internet is down for things like SOS messages. There are also emerging apps that use mesh networks relying on Bluetooth, which can bring connectivity where there is none. "Its almost inevitable that internet access will be truly universal eventually but it'll always be cat and mouse for repressive regimes", Woodward says.

**Excerpt**

My children were recruited in a trafficking scam. I joined a police hunt to find them Foday Musa looked broken as he listened to the last voice message he received from his son. It is 76 seconds long and the young man sounds desperate. He is crying, begging for his father's help. "It's so hard to hear. Hearing his voice hurts me," Musa told BBC Africa Eye, which was given exclusive access to a police unit that helped him as he searched for two of his children who had fallen victim to scammers. It was in February 2024 that Musa's 22-year-old son and 18-year-old daughter, along with five others, were recruited from their remote village in the Faranah region of central Guinea by agents promising them work abroad. The jobs never materialised and the so-called recruiters turned out to be human traffickers. The group was taken across the border into Sierra Leone and held captive. "My heart is broken. I can't stop crying. If you look at my eyes, you can see the pain," Musa said. His case was picked up by the global policing agency Interpol in Guinea, which asked their unit in Sierra Leone to help. So last August Musa, travelled to Makeni, in central Sierra Leone, in a bid to find them. Thousands of people across West Africa are being lured by a human trafficking scam, commonly known as QNET. Founded in Hong Kong, QNET itself is a legitimate wellness and lifestyle company - it allows people to sign up to buy their products and sell them online. Its business model has faced some criticism - however in West Africa, criminal gangs are using its name as a front for their illegal activities. The traffickers target people with the promise of work opportunities in places like the US, Canada, Dubai and Europe, asking them to pay large sums of money for administration costs before they start the job. Once they have paid, they are often trafficked to a neighbouring country and told they can only travel abroad once they recruit others into the scheme. Yet even when they bring in family and friends, the jobs never materialise. QNET itself has a campaign running across the region, involving billboards and media adverts. These are all splashed with the slogan "QNET Against Scams" and the company has rejected allegations that it is linked to human trafficking. Musa and his extended family had already given $25,000 (£19,000) to the traffickers - this encompassed the joining fees and extra money paid to try to get his children home. Travelling to Sierra Leone himself was his last hope. Mahmoud Conteh, the head of investigations at the anti-trafficking unit of Interpol within the Sierra Leone police, said the case was a priority for his unit. "It's very easy for these traffickers to manoeuvre across each of our borders at these illegal crossing points," he told the BBC. When Conteh received a tip-off that a large number of young people were being held in a location in Makeni, Musa joined the police as they raided the property, hoping to find his children. Bags and clothes were strewn across the floors. It is thought 10 to 15 people slept in each room. The Interpol team gathered everyone inside the property and found some as young as 14 had been living there. "The majority are Guineans. There is only one Sierra Leonean among them. All the rest are Guineans," said Conteh. Musa's children were not among them, though one young man said they had been there the previous week - the first potential sighting of his children in a year. The group were transferred to the police station for screening before 19 of them were taken home to Guinea. The police say they have conducted more than 20 raids like this over the past year, rescuing hundreds of victims of human trafficking. Often victims have been moved by the traffickers across borders, but others, like 23-year-old Aminata, a Sierra Leonean whose name has been changed to protect her identity, are trafficked within their own countries. Sitting on a plastic chair with the slopes of Makeni's Wusum Hills behind her in the distance, Aminata told the BBC how a friend had introduced her to people claiming to represent QNET in mid-2024. She was successful in an interview and was told she would go on a course before flying to the US for further study and work. The only catch was she had to pay $1,000 to join the scheme. Convinced it was legitimate, her family gave her the money they had saved for her college fees. "When they first recruit you, they feed you, they take care of you. But as time goes by, they stop," she told the BBC, going on to say this is when she had to go the "extra mile" to survive. "You have to sell your body and go sleep with men so that you can get money - so you can take care of yourself." Aminata said she was told that if she wanted to travel, she had to recruit other people into the scheme. To do this, the traffickers gave her an international number to make it look like she was already abroad when she contacted them. "They take you to the airport and you dress well like you're about to travel. They give you a passport, give you fake travel papers," she explained. "Then they take your photo so you can send them to your friends and family." Aminata managed to persuade six friends and relatives to join the scheme, still hoping the job in the US would materialise. It never did. "I felt awful because they wasted their money and they suffered because of me." She was held somewhere on the outskirts of Freetown, Sierra Leone's capital, for about a year before it dawned on her that the job would never be forthcoming. When Aminata failed to recruit anyone else, it seems she was deemed of no more use to the traffickers - and when she decided to escape, she was not stopped. Returning home after everything that had happened, especially when everyone had thought she had been living abroad, was hard. "I was scared to go back home," she said. "I'd told my friends that I'd travelled abroad. I'd told my family the same. I was thinking about all the money they'd given me to get there." There are no statistics on the number of victims of these types of labour scams but there are constant reports in the media across West Africa of gangs scamming people desperate to believe these foreign jobs schemes are real. The BBC joined the police on about a dozen raids over three days in Makeni and met hundreds of young people who had been trafficked across the region from countries such as Burkina Faso, Guinea, Ivory Coast and Mali. The police said they had arrested 12 suspected traffickers in total. But the reality is that there are only a few successful prosecutions and the under-resourced authorities in the region often face an uphill battle in tackling such scams. According to US state department statistics, between July 2022 - when Sierra Leone's anti-trafficking act was passed - and April 2025, there were only four trafficking convictions. Musa never found his children and had no choice but to return to Guinea without them at the end of September. Conteh, from Interpol, has since told the BBC the traffickers released Foday's children not long afterwards. The BBC has since confirmed that Musa's daughter made it back to Guinea, but she has not returned to her village - and did not want to be interviewed. She has not contacted her father, which points to the shame felt by many of the victims caught up in the scam. The whereabouts of Musa's son are unknown. It remains a desperate situation for their father. "After all that has happened, I really just want it all to be over and to see my kids," said Musa. "We'd love them to come back to the village now - I'd love them to be here with me."

### 5. ['The finest in the world': Why the US is buying icebreakers from Finland](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0q48d71ke8o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

'The finest in the world': Why the US is buying icebreakers from Finland As President Donald Trump continues to insist that the US needs to own Greenland, his wider focus on the Arctic region has seen Washington order new icebreakers. For these ships, which can sail through seas covered in solid ice, the US has gone to the world expert – Finland. Temperatures are sub-zero inside Aker Arctic Technology's ice laboratory, as the scale model of an icebreaker cruises down a 70m-long simulation tank. It ploughs a neat channel through the frozen surface of the water. Undergoing testing at a facility in Helsinki, Finland's capital, this is a design for the next generation of the country's icebreakers. "It's crucial that it has sufficient structural strength and engine power," says ice performance engineer, Riikka Matala. Mika Hovilainen, the firm's chief executive, adds that the shape of the vessel is also crucial. "You have to have a hull form that breaks ice by bending it downwards," he says. "It's not cutting, it's not slicing." Finland is the undisputed world leader when it comes to icebreakers. Finnish companies have designed 80% of all those currently in operation, and 60% were built at shipyards in Finland. The country leads the way out of necessity, explains Maunu Visuri, president and chief executive of Finnish state-owned company Artica, which operates a fleet of eight icebreakers. "Finland is the only country in the world where all the harbours may freeze during wintertime," he says, adding that 97% of all goods to the country are imported by sea. During the coldest months, icebreakers keep Finland's ports open, and work as pathfinders for big cargo ships. "It's really a necessity for Finland. We say that Finland is an island." It was this expertise that saw Trump announce in October that the US planned to order four icebreakers from Finland for the US Coast Guard. A further seven of the vessels, which the US is calling "Arctic Security Cutters", are to be built in the US, using Finnish designs and expertise. "We're buying the finest icebreakers in the world, and Finland is known for making them," said Trump. Under US law, the country's naval and coastguard ships must be domestically-built, but in this case the president waived that requirement on national security grounds. He cited "aggressive military posturing, and economic encroachment by foreign adversaries", by which he means Russia and China. This US concern comes as climate change continues to make the Arctic Ocean more navigable for cargo ships, at least if icebreakers lead the way by cutting a path. This opens up commercial trade routes from Asia to Europe, either above Russia, or north of Alaska and Canada's mainland, and down past Greenland. Reduced ice levels also mean that oil and gas fields beneath the Arctic are more accessible. "There's simply a lot more traffic in that part of the world now," notes Peter Rybski, a retired US Navy officer and Helsinki-based, Arctic expert. "You have an active oil and gas exploration and extraction industry in Russia, as well as a newly-emerging trans-shipment route from Europe to Asia." Following Trump's outline announcement last autumn, the first contracts were awarded on 29 December. Finland's Rauma Marine Constructions is to build two icebreakers for the US Coast Guard at its shipyard in the Finnish port of Rauma. The first ship is due to be delivered in 2028. A further four will be constructed in Louisiana, with all six using an Aker Arctic Technology diesel-electric powered design. The US orders are part of an effort to catch up with the number of Russian icebreakers. Currently Russia has around 40, including eight that are nuclear powered. By contrast, the US presently only has three in operation. Meanwhile China operates around five polar-capable vessels. "None of them are technically icebreakers," says Rybski, pointing to their design not meeting the strict criteria. "But they are increasing their fleet." He adds that China has increasingly been sending these "research" ships into Arctic waters between Alaska and the far east of Russia, including areas that the US considers its "exclusive economic zone". "With limited means to respond this becomes a problem [for the US]." Trump's desire to enlarge its icebreaker fleet goes beyond the practicalities of operating in ice-clad Arctic seas, assesses Lin Mortensgaard, a researcher at the Danish Institute of International Studies. She says it is also about projecting power. "No matter how many aircraft carriers you have and how much you use them to threaten states with, you cannot sail your aircraft carrier into the central Arctic Ocean," she says. "Icebreakers are really the only kind of naval vessel to signal that you are an Arctic state, with Arctic capabilities. And I think this is what much of the US discourse is about." Back in Finland, Helsinki Shipyard occupies a dock on the capital's waterfront. It is where half of the world's icebreakers have been made. Today owned by Canadian firm Davie, it also hopes to win new contracts from the US Coast Guard. "The geopolitical situation has changed definitely," says the shipyard's managing director, Kim Salmi. "We have our eastern neighbour here [Russia]. They are building their own [new] fleet. And the Chinese are building their fleet." He adds: "The US, Canada and the western allies in general, are looking for the power balance." Inside a cavernous shipbuilding hangar, workers cut and weld steel for the yard's latest icebreaker, a heavy-duty Arctic vessel, called Polarmax that's destined for the Canadian coastguard. The Finns can build these complex vessels remarkably swiftly - it takes between two-and-a-half and three years - thanks to a streamlined production method, and decades of experience. "Over 100 years, we have practised this," says Artica's Visuri. "You've got this cycle of designers, operators, builders. That's why Finland is the superpower of icebreakers."
