Spain train crash survivors describe 'absolutely terrifying' scene Passengers caught up in a deadly train crash in Adamuz have described the moment a Madrid-bound train derailed and crossed over to neighbouring tracks, colliding with an oncoming train. Survivors told of people and their belongings being "scattered" around the carriage, and described an "absolutely terrifying" scene. At least 39 people were killed in the high-speed crash at 19:45 local time (18:45 GMT) on Sunday, about an hour after the train left Málaga.

IMF warns of trade tension risk to global growth Trade tensions and a reversal in the artificial intelligence (AI) boom are among the main risks to global economic growth, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned. Its comments came in its latest world economic outlook, where it described the global economy as "steady", with growth expected to remain "resilient" this year. The IMF's forecast was produced ahead of Donald Trump's threat at the weekend to impose tariffs on eight European countries opposed to his proposed takeover of Greenland. The fund also said the independence of central banks was "paramount" for global economic stability and growth. The economic watchdog said global growth was projected to reach 3.3% this year - an increase from its previous forecast of 3.1% - before slowing slightly to 3.2% in 2027. Speaking to the BBC, IMF chief economist Pierre Olivier Gourinchas said: "We have a picture of a global economy that is growing at - it's not outsized growth rates but it's quite resilient, quite robust. "In a sense the global economy has been shaking off the trade disruptions of 2025, and it's coming out ahead of what we were expecting." He said while the effects of Trumps' tariffs has been "definitely to slow down global activity", he added that there "have been other things that have been more than offsetting". The IMF's report says the global economy has been helped by "tailwinds from surging investment related to technology, including artificial intelligence (AI)". However, it said risks to the global outlook "remain tilted to the downside", warning that if expectations about AI growth turn out to be overly optimistic an abrupt market correction could be triggered. Even a relatively mild market correction could have an impact, Gourinchas said, given how much share price gains have contributed to wealth gains in recent years. Other risks are emerging as firms increasingly take on debt to make AI investments. "It doesn't take as much of a market reaction to have an impact on people's wealth relative to their income so that they start cutting consumption, [businesses start] changing their investment plans etc, so there could be some vulnerability there," he said. As well as an end to the AI boom, another possible risk highlighted by the IMF was that "trade tensions could flare up, prolonging uncertainty and weighing more heavily on activity". "Domestic political tensions or geopolitical tensions could erupt, introducing new layers of uncertainty and disrupting the global economy through their impact on financial markets, supply chains, and commodity prices." The IMF estimates the UK grew by 1.4% in 2025, slightly up from its previous projection of 1.3%. Its forecast for this year remains unchanged at 1.3%, which would make it the third fastest growing economy in the G7 behind the US and Canada. It predicts 1.5% growth in 2027. Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the IMF had upgraded the UK's growth for the third time since April 2025, and the country was "on course to be the fastest growing European G7 economy this year and next". But shadow chancellor Sir Mel Stride said: "A 0.1% uptick is not a triumph and the fact Rachel Reeves is celebrating it shows how desperate she has become." The IMF expects global inflation to fall from an estimated 4.1% in 2025 to 3.8% in 2026 and further to 3.4% the following year. In the UK, Gourinchas said price changes in regulated industries, such as transport and energy, had kept inflation elevated last year but "that's going to fade away". The IMF expects UK inflation to return to the 2% target by the end of the year, as a weakening labour market continues to keep wage growth down. The IMF warned that central bank independence was "paramount for macroeconomic stability and economic growth". "Preserving the independence of central banks, both legal and operational, remains critical for avoiding the risk of fiscal dominance, anchoring inflation expectations, and enabling them to achieve their mandates," it said. It comes a week after US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said he was the subject of an "unprecedented" US justice department criminal investigation over his testimony about the bank's building renovations. He said he believed this was due to Donald Trump's anger over the Fed not cutting interest rates, but Trump said he did not know about the investigation. Powell's comments prompted central bank heads across the world to declare "full solidarity" with the US Fed chief, while three former heads of the bank strongly criticised the investigation. Gourinchas said preserving central bank independence would be key to economic success in the years ahead. Without it, he warned, "the economic environment deteriorates pretty rapidly". Gourinchas said challenges to central bank independence had emerged elsewhere, particularly in countries with big borrowing needs, as leaders are enticed by the idea that lower interest rates would make it less expensive to fund government spending. But he warned those dynamics tend to lead to inflation and higher borrowing costs over time. "The evidence is very clear. It's self defeating," he said.

Trump links Greenland dispute to not getting Nobel Peace Prize US President Donald Trump has said he no longer feels obliged to think only of peace after he did not receive the Nobel Peace Prize, as he again repeated his demand for control of Greenland. In a message to Norway's prime minister, Trump blamed the country for not giving him the prize. "Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper' for the US", Trump said in the message obtained by US media. "The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland," he added. CBS News, the BBC's US partner, confirmed the message and its contents. Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre said he had received the text message on Sunday in response to a text he and Finland's president Alexander Stubb had sent to Trump. Støre said they had conveyed opposition to proposed tariff increases over the Greenland dispute, and pointed to the need to de-escalate, proposing a three-way phone call the same day. Støre noted an independent committee, not the government of Norway, awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Trump has made no secret of his desire to be awarded the annual prize. He has increasingly insisted that the US needs to take over Greenland for national security reasons. The sparsely-populated but resource-rich Arctic island is well placed for early warning systems in the event of missile attacks and for monitoring vessels in the region. Trump has repeated that he wants the US to buy Greenland and has not ruled out using military force against a member of the Nato security alliance to take it. Over the weekend, he said he would impose a 10% tariff on goods from eight Nato allies starting in February if they oppose his proposed takeover, and threatened to raise it to 25% by June. In his message to Støre, Trump said Denmark cannot protect Greenland from Russia or China, and questioned "why do they have a "right of ownership" anyway? There are no written documents, it's only that a boat landed there hundreds of years ago, but we had boats landing there, also". "I have done more for NATO than any other person since its founding, and now, NATO should do something for the United States," he concluded. UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said on Monday that any decision about the future status of Greenland "belongs to the people of Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark alone", and called the use of tariffs against allies "wrong". Danish Defence Minister Troels Lund Poulsen and Greenlandic Foreign Affairs Minister Vivian Motzfeldt are due to meet on Monday with Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte. Last week, the Danish and Greenlandic governments, together with Nato allies, decided to increase military presence and exercise activity in the Arctic and the North Atlantic. Several European states sent small numbers of military personnel to Greenland in a so-called reconnaissance mission. As Trump's recent message said, he has claimed to have ended eight wars since his second term as president began last year. The White House has previously listed these as conflicts between Israel and Hamas, Israel and Iran, Pakistan and India, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Thailand and Cambodia, Armenia and Azerbaijan, Egypt and Ethiopia, and Serbia and Kosovo. BBC Verify has examined Trump's claim which include a number of "wars" which had lasted just days, although were the result of long-standing tensions, and in some cases – for example Egypt and Ethiopia - there was no fighting to end. There has also been fighting between Rwanda and the DRC, despite the two sides signing a peace agreement. The peace prize was awarded to Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado. Later, when US forces seized and removed Venezuela's president Nicolás Maduro from Caracas, accusing him of drug trafficking and other crimes, Trump did not endorse Machado as the country's next leader and instead backed Maduro's vice-president as the interim head of government. Machado, who has praised Trump, met him at the White House last week and gave her medal to him. The Nobel Foundation had said the award could not "even symbolically, be passed on or further distributed". What questions do you have about Donald Trump's first year since returning as US president?

### 4. [Japan PM Takaichi calls snap election three months after taking office](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1dk0x0v6pdo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

Japan PM Takaichi calls snap election three months after taking office Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi will dissolve parliament on Friday, paving the way for an early election on 8 February that she hopes will translate her strong public polling into a big majority in the lower house. It was an "extremely weighty decision" that would "determine Japan's course together with the people", Takaichi told a news conference in Tokyo. The country's first female leader and her cabinet have enjoyed high public support since taking office last October. But her party lags behind in polls and the move is risky. It's Japan's second general election in as many years and will test appetite for her plans to boost public spending when cost-of-living is top of voters' minds. Having been elected as prime minister by lawmakers on 21 October, Takaichi is now seeking a public mandate in the House of Representatives, the more powerful house in Japan. Since the day she took office, Takaichi said, she has been "constantly concerned that the Takaichi cabinet has not yet been tested in an election where the public chooses the government". "Is Sanae Takaichi fit to be prime minister? I wanted to ask the sovereign people to decide," she told the news conference. Campaigning for the vote to elect the 465 lower house MPs, who serve four-year terms, starts on 27 January. Her Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has governed Japan almost continuously since 1955. It currently has 199 seats - including three held by its independent partners - in the House of Representatives, the most of any party. The LDP's coalition with the Japan Innovation party gives it a fragile majority, with just enough seats to govern. A protege of former conservative PM Shinzo Abe and self-professed admirer of Margaret Thatcher, Takaichi is known as Japan's "Iron Lady". She came into office promising an economic upturn after years of stagnation. Takaichi is an advocate of heavy government-led spending to drive economic growth - a revival of the sort of stimulus measures that Japan saw under "Abenomics". Her first few months in office have seen soaring personal poll ratings - no Japanese PM has been popular since Abe, in 2012. In December, her cabinet approved a record defence budget of nine trillion yen ($57bn; £43bn). This comes amid growing concern over China, with Tokyo describing its neighbour's military activities in the region as its "greatest strategic challenge". Takaichi has found herself the target of China's ire since last November, when she made comments suggesting that Japan could respond with its own self-defence force if China attacked Taiwan. The diplomatic spat that ensued has sent bilateral ties plunging to their lowest point in more than a decade. Meanwhile, Takaichi has pursued closer ties with the US. During US President Donald Trump's visit to Japan last October, the two leaders heaped praise on each other and signed a deal on rare earths. They also signed a document heralding a new "golden age" of US-Japan relations. Opinion polls show that while the LDP remains broadly unpopular among Japanese residents, Takaichi and her government have charted approval ratings of 60-80%. This popularity is what Takaichi hopes can help the LDP secure a "sole majority" in parliament and push through bolder policies more easily, Dr Seijiro Takeshita, a management professor at the University of Shizuoka, told the BBC World Service's Asia Specific podcast. "She wants to solidify her position to make things smoother at a later stage," Takeshita said. But the snap election gamble comes with its own set of risks. The LDP's leadership has been on shaky ground, and Takaichi is the country's fourth PM in five years. Her predecessors' terms were cut short by falling public support and scandals. Her immediate predecessor, Shigeru Ishiba, also announced a snap election shortly after taking office - leading to one of the LDP's worst ever results and costing the party its majority in the House of Representatives. Another challenge looms in the form of a new, consolidated opposition, the Centrist Reform Alliance, which was formed last week by Japan's largest opposition party, the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, and the Komeito party, the LDP's former coalition partner. Takaichi said the dissolution of parliament was being carried out only "after establishing a thorough system" which ensures there is no disruption to economic policies affecting livelihoods and rising prices. What Takaichi is hoping for is that "people will trust her to deliver on her promises", Dr Jeffrey Kingston, an Asian studies professor at Temple University in the US, told the BBC. Her high approval ratings are "only going to decline so she wants to lock in the benefits of a long honeymoon", he added.

South African team helps search for politician swept away by Mozambique floodwaters South Africa has sent a team to help with rescue efforts after a local politician was swept away by floodwaters while visiting neighbouring Mozambique. Andile Mngwevu, a councillor in the Ekurhuleni municipality, east of Johannesburg, and four others were in Mozambique's Gaza province when their car was caught in a flood, officials say. Only one of the passengers has been accounted for - the "status and whereabouts of the other occupants remain unconfirmed", the municipality said in a statement. Flooding has devastated parts of both countries and resulted in Mozambican President Daniel Chapo cancelling his trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos. His South African counterpart, Cyril Ramaphosa, confirmed that two helicopters had been deployed to help Mozambique "for a number of days until their situation subsides". Weeks of flooding in Mozambique have damaged infrastructure and killed more than 100 people. According to a United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs report, 400,000 people have been affected. In South Africa, more than 30 people have died in just two provinces since November, according to the government. Mozambique has declared a red alert in the wake of the devastating floods while South Africa has announced a national disaster. The rainy season has begun in central and northern Mozambique, with further heavy rain forecast across large parts of the country, which is entering its annual cyclone season.

**Excerpt**

Senegal beat Morocco to win the Africa Cup of Nations for a second time - but only after the final was overshadowed when they temporarily refused to play after the hosts were awarded a stoppage-time penalty with the match goalless. Referee Jean Jacques Ndala gave the spot-kick in the 98th minute after being advised by the video assistant referee (VAR) to consult the pitchside monitor and review defender El Hadji Malick Diouf's challenge on Brahim Diaz. Amid sensational scenes, head coach Pape Thiaw, still incensed by Ndala's decision moments earlier to disallow a Senegal goal, ushered his team off the field. Former Liverpool striker Sadio Mane stayed on the pitch and tried to encourage his Senegal team-mates to finish the game. Following a delay of around 17 minutes, the players did eventually return. Real Madrid forward Diaz, the tournament's top scorer with five goals, was trusted with the penalty, but his tame 'Panenka' effort was caught by Senegal keeper Edouard Mendy who barely had to move, and Ndala immediately blew his whistle for full-time. Villarreal midfielder Pape Gueye then scored the winning goal in the fourth minute of extra time to seal a second triumph in five years for the Lions. In his post-match news conference, Morocco coach Walid Regragui said Senegal's actions were "shameful" and do not "honour Africa". Fifa president Gianni Infantino strongly condemned the "ugly scenes" in a post on Instagram., external Thiaw, meanwhile, had his media briefing cancelled after a ruckus broke out in the press room. But in an interview with BeIN Sport, he accepted that he should not have ordered his team off the field. "We didn't agree," he said. "I don't want to go over all the incidents. I apologise for the football. "After reflecting on it I made them come back [on the pitch] - you can react in the heat of the moment. We accept the errors of the referee. "We shouldn't have done it but it's done and now we present our apologies to football." Thiaw, 44, was initially furious with referee Ndala for disallowing a goal by Crystal Palace forward Ismaila Sarr, who had bundled home from close range. His effort was chalked off for a foul by Abdoulaye Seck on Achraf Hakimi in the build-up. And the penalty decision compounded those feelings. Several of the Senegal players followed Thiaw's request to leave the field, while some of their supporters threw objects and attempted to get on the field. Diaz, who was substituted after Gueye's goal, was left crestfallen as Morocco missed the chance to win a first Afcon title since 1976. After the game, Mane said: "Football is something special, the world was watching, so we have to give a good image for football. "I think it would be crazy to not play this game because what, the referee gave a penalty and we go out of the game? I think that would be the worst thing especially in African football. I'd rather lose than this kind of thing happen to our football. "I think it's really bad. Football should not stop for 10 minutes but what can we do? We have to accept what we did but the good thing is that we came back and we played the game and what happened happened." Former Chelsea keeper Mendy, who now plays for Al-Ahli in the Saudi Pro League, insisted he was "proud" of the way Senegal - instructed by Mane - returned to the field to win their second Afcon title this decade. "What did we say to each other? That's between us," said Mendy. "We did it together and we came back together, that's all that matters. We can be proud." Match-winner Gueye added: "We had a feeling of injustice. Just before the penalty we thought we should have had a goal and the referee didn't go to VAR. "Sadio [Mane] told us to come back on and we remobilised. Edouard [Mendy] then made the save, we stayed focused, got the goal and won the game." 'Violence cannot be tolerated in our sport' After congratulating Senegal on their Afcon triumph and celebrating Morocco as "exceptional hosts", the rest of Infantino's Instagram post was scathing of the scenes witnessed in the final. He wrote it is "unacceptable to leave the field of play in this manner, and equally, violence cannot be tolerated in our sport, it is simply not right", adding the decisions taken by the match officials must always be respected, "because anything less puts the very essence of football at risk". Infantino, 55, said what happened "must be condemned and never repeated", and it is the responsibility of teams and players to set the right example. "I reiterated that they have no place in football and I expect that the relevant disciplinary bodies at Caf will take the appropriate measures," he added. Meanwhile, a statement by the Confederation of African football (Caf) said it "strongly condemns any inappropriate behaviour which occurs during matches, especially those targeting the refereeing team or match organisers". It added: "Caf is reviewing all footage and will refer the matter to competent bodies for appropriate action to be taken against those found guilty." 'It's an awful way for the tournament to end' It's an awful way for a tournament which had felt like such a great advert for African football to end. I couldn't believe the chaos I was witnessing from the commentary box, with some fans trying to get on to the pitch to my left and members of staff being separated down below me in the technical areas. Then the Senegal players walking down the tunnel. It was a terrible look for the Cup of Nations. If I look back at the past few weeks covering this event there has been a huge amount of debate - more than most years - about refereeing decisions and VAR, with accusations from some journalists and fans that hosts Morocco were getting the rub of the green from some officials. It even got to a point where refereeing appointments for certain games were becoming a talking point on social media, which put a lot of pressure on the officials before certain games. Senegal's complaints about the way they'd been treated leading up to the final - including what they felt was a lack of security when they arrived in Rabat on Friday and their lack of tickets - also increased the tension going into this game. Nobody expected the scenes we witnessed after the penalty was awarded though, and this was all in front of the Fifa president Gianni Infantino who was here to present the trophy to the winning side. Morocco have been praised for the way they've organised this tournament - including from the big names like Mohamed Salah - with impressive infrastructure, stadiums and travel links. Sadly for them though, with four years to go until they co-host the World Cup, the astonishing scenes before the Diaz penalty will probably be what will be most remembered about this tournament. 'Little positive to say, but Mane comes out of this well' There is very little positive to say about the end of this game, but one person to come out of it well is Mane. He was the one Senegal player who clearly did not want to walk down the tunnel and was telling his team-mates to come back out. He also walked over to the Senegal fans after the full-time whistle, begging them to calm down. Senegal had 'concerns' over treatment before final Before Sunday's final in Rabat, the Senegal Football Federation (FSF) expressed "serious concerns" over the security of the team. The 2021 winners were swarmed by fans when the team bus arrived in the Moroccan capital on Friday. In a statement on Friday, the FSF also complained about the conditions of the hotel, number of tickets allocated to supporters and the fact that they were not offered a training pitch at Morocco's team base. They said a "lack of adequate security" left players and staff "at risk". "What happened yesterday was not normal," said Thiaw in his pre-match news conference. "Given the number there, anything could have happened. My players could have been in danger. "That type of thing should not happen between two brother countries." Leaving pitch 'not a good look for African football' Former Nigeria forward Efan Ekoku criticised Thiaw and his players, insisting their temporary refusal to play was "not a good look for African football". "It [the penalty award] was soft," Ekoku told E4. "It was foolish and reckless by El Hadji Malick Diouf, but the decision had been made and the players have to abide by that. "You cannot do that [leave the pitch]. However aggrieved you feel at it you have got to let the referee and the rules [make the decision]... I have got some sympathy, but this is not a good look." Meanwhile, Nigeria's 2013 winner John Obi Mikel said he could "understand the frustration" but walking off is "not what I want to see".

**Excerpt**

'Europe won't be blackmailed,' Danish PM says in wake of Trump Greenland threats Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has said "Europe won't be blackmailed" by Donald Trump's tariff threats over Greenland. The US president has said he will impose a new 10% levy on goods from eight allied nations if they oppose his proposed takeover of the autonomous Danish territory. Frederiksen and other European leaders issued a joint statement on Sunday, saying the tariffs risked "undermin[ing] transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral". On Monday, Trump said Nato had been "telling Denmark, for 20 years, that 'you have to get the Russian threat away from Greenland.' Unfortunately, Denmark has been unable to do anything about it. Now it is time, and it will be done!!!" Trump insists Greenland is critical for US security and has previously said Washington would get the territory "the easy way" or "the hard way". He has not ruled out use of force, which has drawn widespread criticism. The new tariffs - taxes on imports - would be imposed on Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the UK, Trump said on Saturday. He said an initial 10% tariff would come into force on 1 February "on any and all goods" sent to the US, but could rise to 25% in June. The levies would "be due and payable until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland", he wrote on his Truth Social platform. In their joint statement, the leaders of those eight countries reiterated their "full solidarity with the Kingdom of Denmark and the people of Greenland". They also stressed their commitment to "strengthening Arctic security as a shared transatlantic interest" as members of the Nato military alliance. "We stand ready to engage in a dialogue based on the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity that we stand firmly behind," the statement reads. Separately, Frederiksen wrote on Facebook: "We want to cooperate and we are not the ones seeking conflict. And I am happy for the consistent messages from the rest of the continent: Europe will not be blackmailed." "It is all the more important that we stand firm on the fundamental values that created the European community." Elsewhere on Sunday, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the threat of tariffs was "completely wrong". Sir Keir, who so far has maintained a strong relationship with Trump, said the UK would be pursuing the matter directly with the White House. Greenland is a sparsely populated but resource-rich. Its location between North America and the Arctic makes it well placed for early warning systems in the event of missile attacks and for monitoring vessels in the region. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday told NBC News' Meet the Press programme that "Greenland can only be defended if it is part of the US, and it will not need to be defended if it is part of the US". "I believe that the Europeans will understand that this is best for Greenland, best for Europe and best for the United States," he said. Speaking to the BBC World Service's Newshour programme, Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said mutual respect for sovereignty is a "non-negotiable" principle of international law and co-operation. "If we are to live in peace and if we are to be able to co-operate on shared problems, we have to start by the mutual recognition of each others sovereignty and territorial integrity," he added. It is still unclear how the tariffs will affect those Trump has already imposed on the UK and EU. French President Emmanuel Macron, who is working to co-ordinate the European response to the tariff threats, said he would request that the EU activate its "anti-coercion instrument" if Trump does impose them. The US president is due to speak at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Wednesday on the theme "how can we co-operate in a more contested world?" Macron, as well as the leaders of Germany and the EU, will also be attending the annual conference. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who will also be there, said his country was "concerned by the recent escalation" and that it would be "significantly increasing Arctic security — strengthening our military and investing in critical infrastructure". "Canada strongly believes that the best way to secure the Arctic is by working together within Nato," he also wrote on X. Meanwhile, Nato chief Rutte has said he has spoken to Trump "regarding the security situation in Greenland and the Arctic". "We will continue working on this, and I look forward to seeing him in Davos later this week," he added. Public anger in both Denmark and Greenland at Trump's threats over Greenland appears undiminished. Demonstrations against Trump's takeover plans were held in Greenland's capital, Nuuk, on Saturday - before the tariff announcement - as well as in Danish cities. These rallies coincided with a visit to Copenhagen by a delegation from the US Congress. Its leader, Democratic Senator Chris Coons, said Trump's rhetoric was "not constructive". The island's representative to the US has said that the last time Greenlanders were asked if they wanted to be part of the US, in January 2025, only 6% were in favour of doing so, while 85% were against. A recent poll suggests that most Americans also oppose US control of Greenland. A Reuters/Ipsos poll, which was released last Wednesday, indicated just 17% of Americans support the US taking Greenland, compared to 47% who said they opposed Trump's push to acquire the island.

**Excerpt**

Man seriously injured in Sydney's third shark attack in two days Three shark attacks have been reported in Sydney in a little over 24 hours, leaving at least two seriously injured, according to local authorities. A man was taken to hospital in critical condition after being injured at Manly beach on Monday evening, New South Wales Police said in a statement. Hours earlier, an 11-year-old surfer had to be assisted off Sydney's Dee Why Beach after a suspected shark bit his surfboard, with the local council urging swimmers and surfers to be cautious. The first incident saw a 12-year-old boy taken to hospital with critical injuries after he was attacked by a large shark while swimming in Sydney Harbour on Sunday afternoon, police said. The boy and his group of friends were jumping off a six-metre rock ledge at Shark Beach, in the Sydney suburb of Vaucluse, when the attack happened on Sunday. Despite its name, shark attacks are rare at Shark Beach, a popular swimming spot. The boy was pulled out of the water by his friends before rescuers arrived. Police said it was their actions that had given him a shot at survival, local media reported. He is currently in intensive care. "The actions of his mates... have been nothing but brave. [It was] a gallant recovery," said Joseph McNulty, who leads the state of New South Wales' marine area command. "Very confronting injuries for those boys to see, but I suppose that's mateship." Marine police arrived to a "horrendous scene", McNulty told reporters. They pulled the boy onto a police speedboat and used tourniquets to try and stop the bleeding from his legs. They also tried to resuscitate the boy as the boat made its way to an ambulance waiting by a wharf. Authorities believe the boy was attacked by a bull shark, an aggressive species found in warm, shallow waters. Many experts consider bull sharks among the most dangerous sharks in the world. McNulty believes heavy rainfall over the weekend and brackish water conditions could have created a "perfect storm environment" for Sunday's attack. Rain flushes nutrients into the rivers and oceans which can draw sharks closer to shore. The final attack, in Sydney's Northern Beaches, prompted police to close all beaches in the area until further notice. According to police, emergency services were alerted to the third attack after a surfer was pulled from the water at North Steyne Beach, Manly, at 18:20 local time (07:20 GMT). He had suffered serious injuries to his legs, and was rushed to hospital. Australia, which is home to some of the world's best beaches, is also one of the deadliest places for shark attacks. There were at least five fatal shark attacks in the country last year.

Chile declares 'state of catastrophe' as wildfires leave at least 18 dead Chilean President Gabriel Boric has declared a state of catastrophe in two regions where deadly wildfires have left at least 18 people dead. More than 50,000 people have also been evacuated in the Ñuble and Biobío regions, about 500km (300 miles) south of the capital Santiago. Boric said the death toll was expected to increase. The most dangerous fire has swept through dry forests bordering the coastal city of Concepción. About 250 homes have been destroyed, disaster officials said. Local media have shown pictures of charred cars in the streets. Chile's forestry agency, Conaf, said firefighters were battling 24 fires across the country on Sunday. The most threatening, it added, were in Ñuble and Biobío. The fires have burnt through 8,500 hectares (21,000 acres) in the two regions so far. "In light of the serious ongoing wildfires, I have decided to declare a state of catastrophe" in the two regions, Boric said in a post on X. "All resources are available," he added. Under a state of catastrophe, Chile's armed forces can be deployed to help. The bulk of the evacuations were carried out in the cities of Penco and Lirquen, just north of Concepción, which have a combined population of 60,000. Strong winds have fanned the flames, exacerbated by high summer temperatures, endangering communities and hampering firefighting efforts. Much of Chile is under heat alerts, with temperatures expected to reach 38C between Santiago and Biobío in the coming days. Chile has experienced a series of devastating fires in recent years, worsened by long-term drought. Two years ago, forest fires killed at least 120 people in the Valparaíso region near Santiago.

Factory explosion in China kills four, injures 84 A huge explosion at a factory in northern China has killed four people and injured 84 others, with six people still missing, state media reported. The blast happened at around 15:00 local time (07:00 GMT) Sunday at Baogang United Steel plant in Inner Mongolia, causing noticeable tremors in the area. Footage online showed the explosion sending large plumes of smoke into the sky, while the ground was littered with debris, including collapsed ceilings and pipes. Five among the dozens hospitalised suffered serious injuries, state media reported. Authorities are investigating the cause of the blast. Baogang United Steel is a major state-owned iron and steel enterprise. China has a long history of industrial accidents, from factory explosions and mine collapses to mudslides. In 2015, two massive explosions in the port of Tianjin killed 173 people, leaving hundreds more injured and devastating large areas of the city. In May last year, an explosion in a chemical plant in the eastern province of Shandong killed five people and injured at least 19. The blast ripped the windows of building nearby from their hinges.

**Excerpt**

What we know about Spain's worst rail disaster in over a decade At least 39 people have died and dozens more have been injured after two high-speed trains collided in southern Spain, the country's Civil Guard has said. The incident near the city of Córdoba has been described by local officials as Spain's worst rail crash in more than a decade. Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez is expected to visit the scene later on Monday, where rescue efforts are ongoing. Here's what we know about the incident so far. Where did the crash happen? The crash occurred at around 19:45 local time (18:45 GMT) on Sunday, about an hour after one of the trains departed Málaga for Madrid. The train derailed and crossed over to the opposite track, operator Adif said. It then collided with an oncoming train travelling from south Madrid to Huelva, which was forced into an embankment running alongside the track, Spain's Transport Minister Óscar Puente said on Sunday. The majority of those killed and injured were in the front carriages of the Huelva-bound train, he added. What caused the crash? What caused the train to derail remains unclear. Officials say an investigation has been launched but it is not expected to determine what happened for at least a month. Puente has described the crash as "extremely strange" and said all the railway experts consulted by the government "are extremely baffled by the accident". The president of Spain's state-owned rail operator, Renfe, said he had "discarded" the possibility that the incident occured due to excessive speed or human error. Álvaro Fernández Heredia told Spain's national radio RNE that even if a mistake had been made, a system within the train would have fixed it. He added that both trains were travelling under the maximum speed limit on the stretch of track where the crash happened. He suggested a mechanical fault or an infrastructure issue was a more likely cause. Are people still trapped in the trains? There were around 400 passengers and staff on the two trains, operated by Iryo and Renfe, according to a statement from Renfe. It is not clear if there are people still trapped inside the carriages but rescue teams are on site. "The problem is that the carriages are twisted, so the metal is twisted with the people inside," Francisco Carmona, head of firefighters in Córdoba, told Spanish public broadcaster RTVE. "We have even had to remove a dead person to be able to reach someone alive. It is hard, tricky work," he added. The president of the Andalusian regional government, Juanma Moreno, told local outlet Canal Sur that they are waiting for "heavy machinery" to "practically lift" parts of the second train, which "has taken the worst part of this accident". "Until the heavy machinery can do its job and free the wagons from the track", emergency services will not be able to start "searching and identifying" any remaining victims, he added. Who are the victims? The 39 victims of the crash have not yet been identified, with Puente saying the death toll "is not yet final" as investigations into the crash commence. As of midday on Monday, 112 people had received medical assistance, 43 of whom remained hospitalised, local emergency services said. Among the 43 victims still in hospital: Four are under the age of 18, including one who is in intensive care - Twelve adults are also in intensive care - What have the survivors said? Passengers on board the Madrid-bound train described the moment of impact feeling like an "earthquake" and said it shattered the train's windows, displaced luggage and threw people to the floor. "I was in the first carriage. There was a moment when it felt like an earthquake and the train had indeed derailed," journalist Salvador Jimenez told Canal Sur. "There were people screaming, calling for doctors," he added. Another passenger, Lucas Meriako, told Spanish broadcaster La Sexta Noticias he was in the fifth carriage of the same train when he started to "feel some banging" that got louder and louder. "Another train passed us and everything started vibrating. There was a jolt behind us and the feeling that the whole train was going to fall apart," he described.

Ecstasy and now a day off - Senegal fans around the world celebrate Afcon win Senegal's President Bassirou Diomaye Faye has declared Monday a public holiday after the national team won the Africa Cup of Nations after beating tournament hosts Morocco 1-0 in a dramatic final on Sunday. A disallowed goal, players walking off the pitch and a saved penalty made it a tense night in the stadium in the Moroccan capital, Rabat. In Senegal's capital, Dakar, supporters were excited as they gathered at an outdoor screen at the foot of the giant African Renaissance Monument. As the match unfolded the tension was too much to bear for some. The moment Morocco's Brahim Diaz stepped up to take the penalty that would have won his country the Afcon trophy for the first time in 50 years was unwatchable for this Senegal fan. But his miss and Senegal's subsequent goal in extra time were met with ecstasy in Dakar. "What just happened is divine... a scenario as if it were a Netflix series is crazy," fan Mohamed Diop told the Reuters news agency. The other side of the coin, of course, was the devastation for Moroccans at a fan park in the city of Sale. "Maybe next time," one man told Reuters. "We have good players. Now we should get back to work so we can win in 2027." Moroccan fans watching in the Dutch city of Eindhoven were also shocked by Diaz's penalty miss. But back in Dakar, once the final whistle had blown, the party started. "We really needed to win. This team showed me courage and seriousness. We gave everything we had. We really thank Sadio Mané, he gave us everything," supporter Modou Yacine Diop told Reuters. Senegal fans in the Italian city of Milan also came out on the streets. People also celebrated in the Château Rouge area of the French capital, Paris, which some know as Little Africa. In the Spanish capital, Madrid, people followed the match in restaurants in the Lavapies neighbourhood. And at a watch party in New York, hosted by new city mayor Zohran Mamdani, Senegal fans joined the festivities. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

### 13. [What tariffs has Trump announced and why?](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn93e12rypgo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

What tariffs has Trump announced and why? US President Donald Trump has threatened to impose fresh tariffs on eight allies that oppose his demands for control of Greenland. Last year, he placed taxes on goods reaching the US from countries around the world, arguing the move would boost American manufacturing and create jobs. Critics warned of higher prices and damage to the global economy. What are tariffs and how do they work? Tariffs are taxes on imported goods. Typically, the charge is a percentage of a good's value. For example, a 10% tariff on a $10 product would mean a $1 tax on top - taking the total cost to $11 (£8.17). The tax is paid to the government by companies bringing in the foreign products. These firms may pass some or all of the extra cost on to their customers, which in this case means ordinary Americans and other US businesses. They may also decide to import fewer goods. Why is Trump using tariffs? Trump says tariffs increase the amount of tax raised by the government, encourage consumers to buy more American-made goods and boost investment in the US. He wants to reduce the US trade deficit - the gap between the value of goods it buys from other countries and those it sells to them. The president argues that the US has been exploited by "cheaters" and "pillaged" by foreigners. Trump has also used tariffs to make other demands. He has threatened fresh tariffs of 10% on the UK, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Finland, because they oppose a US takeover of Greenland. Trump said the tariffs would be in place by 1 February and would rise to 25% by 1 June. When announcing tariffs against China, Mexico and Canada, he said the countries must do more to stop migrants and the illegal drug fentanyl reaching the US. Many tariffs have been amended or delayed after being announced. Why has the Supreme Court been considering the legality of Trump's tariffs? Trump's tariffs have faced numerous legal challenges. Instead of getting Congressional approval, the Trump administration used the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Declaring an emergency under the law meant Trump could issue immediate orders and bypass Congress. In August 2025, a US appeals court ruled that most of Trump's tariffs were illegal, but left them in place. The White House asked the US Supreme Court to overturn that decision. A ruling is expected in the coming weeks. Trump has posted on social media that it would be a "complete mess" if the Supreme Court struck down his tariffs, and warned of difficulties if businesses were told they could claim refunds. "It would take many years to figure out what number we are talking about and even, who, when, and where, to pay," Trump said. What are Trump's tariffs on countries? Negotiations are continuing with a number of countries, including America's top three trading partners. China, Canada and Mexico were all warned that they faced particularly high tariffs: China and the US threatened tariffs on each other's goods of more than 100% in the months after Trump took office at the start of 2025, but subsequently extended a truce until November. On 30 October, after meeting President Xi Jinping, Trump said the two countries would sign a trade deal "pretty soon". He announced an immediate end to the part of tariffs levied on Chinese goods over concerns about Beijing's failure to stop the flow of ingredients used to make fentanyl. Tariff exclusions on 178 Chinese products have been extended until 10 November 2026. Other much lower tariffs remain in place for non-exempt goods - Canada is facing 35% tariffs on its goods - although most are exempt under the existing United States-Canada-Mexico (USMCA) free trade agreement. Canada is affected by the blanket 50% levy on imported metals and 25% on non-US automobiles. On 25 October, Trump said he was suspending trade talks and would increase Canada's levies "by 10% over and above what they are paying now", after the country broadcast an anti-tariff advert. Prime Minister Mark Carney later apologised to Trump - Mexico is facing 30% tariffs on its goods, plus the sector-specific levies and a 25% fentanyl tariff. However, like Canada, most of its goods are exempt under the USMCA. The tariffs were put on hold until the end of October to allow time to strike a deal. On 27 October, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said she and Trump had agreed to extend this deadline by "a few more weeks". Talks are ongoing - A patchwork of different rates is in place for other countries. Many of these stem from Trump's announcement in April 2025 that a "baseline" of 10% would apply to imports from all countries. Nations considered the "worst offenders" would face higher rates, as payback for unfair trade policies. New tariff rates for dozens of countries were subsequently introduced in August, after delays to allow for trade talks. These include: 50% tariffs on Indian goods - including a 25% penalty for trade with Russia - 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods - 30% tariffs on South African goods - 20% tariffs on Vietnamese goods - 15% tariffs on Japanese goods - 15% tariffs on South Korean goods - 15% tariffs on most EU goods - On 13 January, Trump announced the US would apply a 25% tariff to countries which continue to trade with Iran, after Tehran cracked down on anti-government protests, with thousands of people feared dead. On 17 January, the US president said he would impose a 10% tariff on eight countries who are opposed to his proposed takeover of Greenland. The extra tariff on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the UK, the Netherlands and Finland would come into force on 1 February, but could later rise to 25% - and would last until a deal was reached. What is the UK tariff deal? In June 2025, the UK negotiated a 10% US tariff rate, the lowest so far of any country that has struck a deal with Trump. It exported about £58bn of goods to the US in 2024 - mainly cars, machinery and pharmaceuticals. The 10% rate applies to the first 100,000 UK vehicles exported every year - roughly the number of cars sold in 2024. Additional vehicles face the standard 25% tariff. The agreement also lets the two countries sell beef to each other. Some US ethanol will face 0% tariffs, instead of 19%. Trump announced "the deal was done" in June, but did not confirm the expected removal of all charges on steel imports from the UK. The UK is the only country which does not face 50% tariffs on steel and aluminium. It pays 25% instead. The BBC understands the plan to eliminate tariffs on UK steel exports entirely has now been put on hold. However, speaking to reporters ahead of his second state visit to the UK in September, Trump said he was "into helping" Britain fine-tune the deal. Which goods are affected by Trump's tariffs? Some taxes announced by Trump are on particular products, wherever they are made. These include: 100% tariff on branded or patented drugs (unless a company is building a factory in the US) - 50% tariff on steel and aluminium imports (except for those from the UK) - 50% tariff on copper imports - 50% tariff on kitchen and bathroom cabinets and some furniture - 25% tariff on most foreign-made cars, engines and other car parts - 25% tariff on all heavy-duty trucks - In addition, Trump ended an exemption for imports valued at $800 (£592) or less. It means low-cost goods are no longer duty-free - a move affecting millions of packages sent every day, including those from online retailers like Shein and Temu. The companies shipping the parcels now have to pay duties based on the tariff rate which applies to the country the goods were sent from. Otherwise, for six months, they can choose to pay a fixed fee of between $80 and $200 per package. On 2 January, the White House confirmed it had slashed proposed tariffs of almost 92% on some imported pasta. The government had alleged that certain Italian-made goods were being sold at "less than normal value" in the US, undercutting local producers, but reduced the level of the tariffs after what it called constructive engagement with the firms in question. In November, Trump signed an executive order exempting a range of other food products from tariffs, including avocados, bananas, beef and coffee. The administration said it acted because the specified goods could not be produced in sufficient quantities domestically. Are prices going up for US consumers? Shoppers have seen price rises for some products, including toys, appliances and furniture as well as certain foodstuffs. US inflation was 3% in the 12 months to September, having gone up since April, when it stood at 2.4%. It fell back to 2.7% in November, and remained at that level in December, which was lower than many analysts had expected. Many firms have said they will pass on the cost of tariffs to US customers, including Target, Walmart and Adidas. The cost of goods manufactured in the US using imported components is also expected to rise. For example, car parts typically cross the US, Mexican and Canadian borders multiple times before a vehicle is completely assembled. How are tariffs affecting the US and global economies? Trump was accused of throwing the global economy into turmoil when he announced the first tariffs of his second presidential term. Although financial markets have since largely recovered, in October 2025 the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said the overall picture remained volatile, and that US tariffs were having a negative effect. It forecast global growth of 3.2% for 2025, and 3.1% in 2026. That was a slight increase from its July predictions, but still below the 3.3% it had projected for both years before Trump's measures were announced. It thinks the US economy will grow by 2% in 2025, and 2.1% in 2026. That's down from the 2.8% growth recorded in 2024, but still the fastest among the world's most advanced economies. The most recent US figures show the economy picked up speed over the three months to September 2025, as consumer spending jumped and exports increased. The economy grew at an annual rate of 4.3%, up from 3.8% in the previous quarter. That was better than expected, and marked the strongest growth in two years. Imports - which count against growth - continued to decline during the period.

### 14. [Fears Iran's internet shutdown could lead to 'extreme digital isolation'](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg5gegrdq3go?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

Fears Iran's internet shutdown could lead to 'extreme digital isolation' Iran is 10 days into one of the most extreme internet shutdowns in history, with 92 million citizens cut off from all internet services and even disruption to phone and text messaging. The Iranian government cut off services on 8 January, apparently to stifle dissent and prevent international scrutiny of a government crack down on protesters. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said the internet was cut off in response to what he described as externally directed "terrorist operations". The government has not said when internet services will return, but new reports suggest that, behind the scenes, the authorities may be making plans to restrict it permanently. On 15 January, the news website IranWire reported that government spokesperson Fatemeh Mohajerani told journalists that international web access will not be available until at least the Iranian New Year in late March. Internet freedom observers at FilterWatch believe the government is hastily implementing new systems and rules to cut Iran off from the international internet. "There should be no expectation of reopening international internet access, and even afterwards, users' access to international internet will never return to its previous form," FilterWatch said, citing unnamed government sources. While the BBC cannot independently verify this report or the timing of its implementation, journalists who spoke to BBC Persian also said they were told that internet access would not be restored anytime soon. From temporary outage to "communication black hole" Iran has maintained a tight grip over the internet for many years, with most western social media apps and platforms blocked, as well as external news websites like BBC News. However many people have managed to access popular apps such as Instagram using Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). Internet freedom campaigners at Access Now say Iran has consistently used shutdowns as a way to mask mass violence and brutal crackdowns on protesters, as seen during the nationwide internet shutdowns during the November 2019 and September 2022 protests. A shutdown was also imposed during the Iran-Israel conflict in June 2025. However, the current blackout has lasted longer than any previous shutdown. In a public statement, the charity Access Now said that full restoration of internet access is imperative. "Restricting access to these essential services not only endanger lives but embolden authorities to conceal and evade accountability for human rights abuses," it said. Already there are reports that livelihoods in Iran are being badly impacted by the shutdown with e-commerce particularly affected. As of 18 January, the Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) estimates that more than 3,300 confirmed protester deaths have been recorded, with more than 4,380 cases under review. It also reports that the number of arrests has reached 24,266 across 187 cities. The real number of people killed and detained is believed to be significantly higher, but the lack of access means the figures cannot be independently verified. Internet monitoring project, FilterWatch, says that the latest shutdown spells the start of a more extreme "digital isolation" and increased surveillance on what is said, sent and viewed online. Amir Rashidi, director of cyber security and digital rights at the Miaan Group, which runs FilterWatch, told the BBC he believes the authorities are moving towards a tiered system in which access to the global internet would no longer be automatic but subject to approval. Access would be granted through a registration and vetting process, he expects, adding that the technical infrastructure for such a system has been in place for years. Who decides about the Internet? According to FilterWatch, the plans are not being spoken about publicly, with key decisions increasingly concentrated within security bodies rather than civilian ministries. Protecting Iran from cyber attacks - of which there have been many high profile and disruptive cases in recent years - may be another motivation for the extreme moves. However, analysts caution that the plans may not fully materialise or could be applied unevenly due to internal power dynamics and broader economic and technical pressures. Amir Rashidi notes that risks to internet providers, alongside users' ability to adapt or migrate to alternative platforms, could further complicate implementation. If Iran goes ahead with the plans being reported on, it will be following similar systems in Russia and China. China has led the world on internet control not just with enormous state censorship over online discussion but also with what people are able to access abroad. The so-called Great Chinese Firewall blocks citizens from much of the global internet and all western apps like Facebook, Instagram and YouTube are not reachable without VPNs - but they are also becoming harder to use. In 2019, Russia began testing for a grand plan to create a similar system dubbed Ru-net. But unlike China, which built state control into the internet as the web spread decades ago, Russia is having to retrofit state control into complex systems. Russia is going a step further than China and planning to switch itself off from the world wide web with a "kill switch", which will apparently be used at times of crisis. The system will allow internal internet traffic and keep the country moving online but without traffic going outside or in - a digital border in effect. But it has yet to be fully tested. Where is internet in Iran heading? If the reports are accurate, it seems that Iran is planning to a quasi combination of permanent Chinese and Russian internet control. "In Iran there seems to be a move to isolate everyone from any electronic access, unless approved by the government," said computer security expert Prof Alan Woodward from Surrey University in the UK, after reviewing the reports of Iran's plans. He believes the Iranian regime has probably moved ahead with its longer term plans, using the current blackout as a reason to make the technical switches and orders now, whilst everything is cut off. Amir Rashidi says the question is no longer technical, but political - arguing that whether such systems are fully implemented now depends on political will. Starlink and other internet-from-space services, known as Low Earth Orbit (LEO), have also complicated control for Iran during the protests. LEO internet services allow users to get around all censorship and shutdowns by connecting via satellites. The government was able to jam and interfere with some Starlink users but it has been confirmed to the BBC that other terminals remain operational after the company updated its firmware to bypass government blocking efforts. The service, which is owned by Elon Musk, also waived subscription fees for Iranian users. In spite of the increasing tools being used by repressive regimes, Woodward is surprisingly optimistic about the future of internet. He cites advances in LEO and the fact that many phones can now use satellites even when the internet is down for things like SOS messages. There are also emerging apps that use mesh networks relying on Bluetooth, which can bring connectivity where there is none. "Its almost inevitable that internet access will be truly universal eventually but it'll always be cat and mouse for repressive regimes", Woodward says.
