Pedro Pascal and Meryl Streep lead tributes to Catherine O'Hara Meryl Streep, Pedro Pascal and Ben Stiller are among celebrities to have paid tribute to Emmy-winning actor Catherine O'Hara, who died on Friday aged 71. The Canadian-born star was best known for her roles in the films Beetlejuice and Home Alone, as well as comedy TV series including Schitt's Creek and The Studio. Streep said O'Hara brought "love and light to our world, through whipsmart compassion for the collection of eccentrics she portrayed", while The Last of Us co-star Pascal said he was "eternally grateful" to have worked with her. Ben Stiller said it was "hard to explain the impact she had on comedy", adding that for him there was "no one better". O'Hara died on Friday at her home in Los Angeles following a brief illness, her agent told the BBC. After starting her career in Canada's comedy scene, she turned out a series of unforgettable film performances netting her critical acclaim. Streep, who appeared alongside O'Hara in the 1980s comedy Heartburn, described her death as "such a loss for her family and friends, and the audience she graced as friends". Michael Keaton, who co-starred in 1988's Beetlejuice and its 2024 sequel Beetlejuice Beetlejuice, remarked: "We go back before the first Beetlejuice. She's been my pretend wife, my pretend nemesis and my real life, true friend. "This one hurts. Man am I gonna miss her." Tim Burton, who directed both films, shared a picture of the cast of the latter film on Facebook. "Catherine, I love you," he said. "This picture shows how much light you gave to all of us. You were a special part of my life and afterlife." Alec Baldwin, who also starred in the film, said O'Hara possessed "a quality that was all her own" and described her as "one of the greatest comic talents in the movie business". In his tribute, Pascal said "there is less light in my world" adding: "This lucky world that had you will keep you, always." Her on-screen son in holiday classics Home Alone and Home Alone 2: Lost In New York, Macaulay Culkin, also paid an emotional tribute on Instagram. "Mama. I thought we had time. I wanted more. I wanted to sit in a chair next to you," he wrote. "I heard you. But I had so much more to say. I love you. I'll see you later." O'Hara's popularity had a resurgence of late after she starred as the outlandish Moira in Schitt's Creek. The show's co-creator Dan Levy described her as "family before she ever played my family". He added on Instagram that he would "cherish every funny memory I was fortunate enough to make with her". His father, Eugene, who also starred in the series, had a longtime friendship with O'Hara having collaborated with her many times over a period spanning more than 50 years. "Words seem inadequate to express the loss I feel today," he told Variety in a statement. "I cherished our working relationship, but most of all our friendship. And I will miss her." Alongside winning a Golden Globe award for best actress in 2021 for her role in Schitt's Creek, O'Hara was nominated for portraying ousted movie executive Patty Leigh in Seth Rogen's satirical swipe at the workings of Hollywood, The Studio, at this year's awards. She also remains nominated at the Actor Awards (formerly the Screen Actors Guild Awards), which take place in March, for her role as Patty. Rogen said on Friday that, when he first met O'Hara, he told her she "was the funniest person I'd ever had the pleasure of watching on screen" and that Home Alone was the film that made him want to make movies. "Getting to work with her was a true honour," he wrote on Instagram. O'Hara was also described as "one of the comic giants of our age" by actor and director Christopher Guest, who worked with her on four films including 2006's For Your Consideration. His wife, actress Jamie Lee Curtis, shared a clip of O'Hara in Guest's 1996 mockumentary Waiting for Guffman, alongside the caption "BEST OF THE BEST IN SHOW", a reference to the title of one of his later films that also starred O'Hara. Fellow Canadian actor and comedian Mike Myers - of Austin Powers and Shrek fame - described her death as "a very sad day for comedy and for Canada". Former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau described her as a "beloved Canadian icon", while the country's current leader Mark Carney said it had "lost a legend". O'Hara is survived by her husband Bo Welch, her sons Matthew and Luke, and her six siblings.

Israeli air strikes kill at least 27 Palestinians in Gaza, rescue officials say At least 27 people have been killed in a wave of Israeli air strikes across the Gaza Strip on Saturday, according to local authorities. The civil defence agency, which is operated by Hamas, says children and women were among those killed. It added that in one attack, helicopter gunships hit a tent sheltering displaced people in the southern city of Khan Younis. Palestinians have described these strikes as the heaviest since the second phase of the ceasefire, brokered by President Trump in October, came into effect earlier this month. The Israeli military confirmed that a number of strikes were carried out in response to what it said was a Hamas violation of the agreement on Friday. Both Israel and Hamas have accused each other of violating the truce since it came into effect last year. In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said "eight terrorists were identified exiting the underground terror infrastructure in eastern Rafah", an area in Gaza where Israeli forces are deployed under the October agreement. The IDF said it had, together with the Israel Security Agency (ISA), struck targets in various locations including "four commanders and additional terrorists" as well as a weapons storage facility, a weapons manufacturing site and "two launch sites belonging to Hamas in the central Gaza Strip". Hamas has condemned the strikes and urged the US to take immediate action, adding that "these ongoing violations" confirm that the Israeli government "continues its brutal war of genocide against the strip". It said that seven of the victims were from one displaced family in Khan Younis, with a civil defence spokesman adding that the strikes hit residential apartments, tents, shelters and a police station. Officials at Gaza City's Shifa hospital said an air strike on the city hit a residential apartment, killing three children and two women. "We found my three little nieces in the street. They say 'ceasefire' and all. What did those children do? What did we do?" said Samer al-Atbash, an uncle of the three dead children, according to Reuters news agency. Video footage and images from across Gaza showed several bodies being lifted out of rubble and a number of buildings destroyed. The war between Israel and Hamas began after the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, when about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage. Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 71,660 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. It says at least 509 Palestinians have been killed since the ceasefire began on 10 October 2025. Four Israeli soldiers have also been killed. Though Israel has previously disputed figures from the Hamas-run health ministry, a senior security source was reported by local media as saying that the military accepts that more than 70,000 Palestinians have been killed during the war in Gaza. The health ministry's figures have been deemed reliable by the UN and other human rights groups and widely cited by international media. Israel does not allow news organisations, including the BBC, into Gaza to report independently. The strikes come as the Rafah crossing, Gaza's border with Egypt, is due to reopen on Sunday after the IDF recovered the body of Israel's last hostage earlier this week.

**Excerpt**

This army chief threatened to castrate opposition leader and claimed descent from Jesus A fiery tweeter who is in charge of Uganda's military, Gen Muhoozi Kainerugaba is decried by his critics as being in the middle of an unholy trinity, or alliance, of three men who rule the East African nation with an iron fist. Kainerugaba, the son of the country's long-time leader Yoweri Museveni, has posted on social platform X about the killing of opposition supporters during this month's fiercely contested presidential election. In posts which were subsequently deleted, he also threatened to have the testicles of defeated opposition candidate Bobi Wine removed. With the 81-year-old president winning a seventh term, analysts say this is likely to be his last term and he is grooming his 51-year-son to succeed him. The so-called "unholy alliance" - a play on the Christian doctrine of the Holy Trinity - is made up of Museveni, Kainerugaba, and the president's powerful brother and special adviser, Salim Saleh. Kenya-based analyst for the Institute for Security Studies think-tank, Nicodemus Minde, tells the BBC that he heard the description during a recent research trip to Uganda. "The Father being Museveni, then the Son being Muhoozi, then the Unholy Spirit could be the uncle, Salim Saleh," he says. Minde describes Saleh as a "power behind the scenes", saying he was "influential in terms of money, business and access". Opposition supporters accuse the family of believing they have a God-given right to rule Uganda, with Museveni extending his 40-year-rule after he was declared the winner of the election with more than 70% of the vote. Indeed Anita Among, the speaker in the last parliament, also used the image of the holy trinity last year, as she rallied voters to back Museveni. "We believe in God the Father - and God the Father is President Museveni. God the Son is MK [Muhoozi Kainerugaba], and now you [the voters] are the Holy Spirit. Therefore, vote for them," she was quoted as saying in comments that came in for some criticism. After getting just 24% of the vote, Wine dismissed the results as "fake", claiming widespread "ballot-stuffing" was behind Museveni's victory. This incurred the wrath of Kainerugaba, who threatened the opposition leader, giving him "exactly 48 hours to surrender himself to the police". "If he doesn't we will treat him as an outlaw/rebel and handle him accordingly," he wrote. Those tweets - and the one in which he threatened to remove Wine's testicles - have since been deleted. Wine, who had gone into hiding after a raid on his house following the election, later called out the general on X and included a screengrab of some of the deleted tweets - to which Kainerugaba responded with the comment: "Boo hoo hoo Mr. 24%." Another tweet saying Wine was wanted "dead or alive" is still on his feed, even though a government minister has said the opposition leader is free to carry out his activities. The army chief later accused the US of helping Wine escape and said that all military co-operation between the two countries would be suspended. On Friday, he apologised, saying he had been given "wrong information". He subsequently announced "I intend to reduce my interactions" on the social media site. Last year, he said he would leave X before returning after just a few days. Kainerugaba has a long history of controversial posts, some of which have been later deleted, and is also known as the "tweeting general". He has also invoked religion to advance his political aspirations. "I fear no one on this planet because my bloodline is from Jesus Christ," he posted earlier this month. This tweet has also been deleted. A long-time friend of the general, who spoke on condition of anonymity, says he is "incredibly loyal", and compares his posting to US President Donald Trump. "He might be Trumpian, but that's him expressing himself," the friend tells the BBC. He says "it is wrong to try to understand him from the tweets that he posts", adding that Kainerugaba is "a man of complex character". Minde describes the general's posts as often "wild", but says that many of his comments can make sense when viewed within the context of Uganda's succession politics - in particular Kainerugaba's bid to position himself as his father's heir. "He probably wants to endear himself to his father," Minde tells the BBC, but adds that some of the posts are deliberate "provocations". He says that Kainerugaba's statements do little to win him public favour. Kainerugaba's friend, on the other hand, tells the BBC the general would be an "incredible successor" to his father. He points out that Uganda is a post-conflict country where security is all-important. "This is our number-one priority, to make sure that you are peaceful and stable and [Kainerugaba] is very experienced in that sphere. He's been doing this all his life," he adds. However, some of his posts could threaten international relations if taken at face-value. In 2022 he threatened to invade neighbouring Kenya, triggering a backlash from Kenyans who trolled him for his "reckless" comments. He responded by urging them to "relax", but as the row escalated, Museveni was forced to phone his Kenyan counterpart William Ruto to apologise for his son's "mistake". Kainerugaba has in the past downplayed some of his remarks as "musings" and "abstractions" that do not need to be taken seriously. Uganda-based security analyst Freddie David Egesa observes that the military chief "enjoys having that kind of vibe". "He sometimes likes joking around it," Egesa says. Kainerugaba's friend says the general is "a kind, generous, intensely smart person who spends all his time thinking about the peace and security of this country". He adds that the general executes his responsibilities to the best of his abilities. "And that's why he serves in the role that he serves." Critics say Kainerugaba has brooked little opposition in the country, acting decisively against anyone perceived as a threat to his father's administration. By the general's own admission on X, at least 30 people were killed and 2,000 others detained by security officers following the recent elections. Before the polls, opposition rallies were disrupted, with security forces at times opening fire. The United Nations said the election was held in an "environment marked by widespread repression and intimidation against the political opposition". Kainerugaba played a role in the four-day internet blackout that lasted until after the elections, Reuters news agency quoted Andrew Mwenda, a Ugandan political commentator and close ally of the general, as saying. The internet remained partially restricted afterwards, but on Monday, Kainerugaba posted that access to all social media platforms was being restored. "We are releasing all social media today," he wrote. On the same day, he took to X to deny that his soldiers had beaten up Bobi Wine's wife Barbara Kyagulanyi. She had alleged from her hospital bed on Saturday that military officers had assaulted her overnight as they searched for her husband. According to Minde, Kainerugaba's actions appear driven by loyalty or a desire to protect Museveni's administration. The general's first name, Muhoozi, means avenger. "I named him Muhoozi, which means vengeance, such that when someone wrongs me, he avenges," Museveni once explained. Kainerugaba, who was born in 1974, grew up in exile in Tanzania, Kenya and Sweden before his father took power in 1986 after overthrowing the brutal regime of Milton Obote. He joined the military in 1999, enrolled at the UK's elite Sandhurst military academy and graduated the following year. He is married with several children. He rapidly rose through the military ranks shortly after joining the army, reaching the rank of lieutenant-general 10 years later. He was promoted to a full general in 2022. He played a pivotal role in the formation of the Special Forces Command (SFC), an elite military unit responsible for his father's security. The SFC has been accused of involvement in a wave of abductions and torture of opposition members. It has denied the allegations, but some of its officers have been convicted of abusing their power. The most prominent case was that of a 32-year-old SFC soldier, who was court-martialled and sentenced to death in 2024 for shooting dead three people and injuring two others, including a one-year-old child. And after a bodyguard of Wine, Edward Sebuufu went missing last May, Kainerugaba revealed on X that he was in detention "in my basement", and sparked a social media storm after he published a photo of him appearing half-naked and with his beard shaved off. As with Wine, he threatened to castrate Sebuufu. Wine has alleged that members of the SFC, as well as the military, were behind a raid on his home the day after the election. The unit is viewed as a shadow army that has helped Museveni, along with his ever-growing family dynasty, to consolidate power. The latest addition to the political dynasty is Kainerugaba's son, Ruhamya, who has joined the army - seen as the first step to acquiring power in Uganda. In the years to come, the composition of the trinity could change, with Kainerugaba as the Father, Ruhamya as the Son and another family patriarch succeeding Saleh as the Spirit.

More than 200 killed in mine collapse in DR Congo More than 200 people have been killed in a mine collapse in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, rebel authorities have said. The mine, in the town of Rubaya, gave way on Wednesday due to heavy rains, Lumumba Kambere Muyisa, spokesman for the North Kivu region's rebel governor, told reporters. At the time, the death toll remained unclear. Women and children were among those mining coltan - a mineral used to manufacture electronics such as smartphones and computers - at the time. A former supervisor of the mine told the BBC the site was not properly maintained, making accidents more likely and hampering rescue efforts when they occur. He added that the fragile nature of the soil made the situation worse. Women, children and artisanal miners - those not officially employed by a mining firm - are among those killed in the collapse. Around 20 survivors are said to be receiving treatment in hospital. A source whose cousin died in the landslide expressed shock, saying it was "a big loss" for the family and community. "I didn't believe he could pass away in such circumstances," the source, who did not wish to be named, told the BBC, describing his cousin as a "courageous" and "ambitious" man whose main goal was to provide for his wife and two children. "I didn't believe [he was dead] because investigations were still ongoing. His body wasn't found after the accident, so I did have hope that he could be found alive. Unfortunately, some hours later, his body was discovered." Governor Erasto Bahati Musanga, who was appointed by M23 rebels after seizing swathes of territory in North Kivu, visited survivors of the incident on Friday. Rubaya is one of a number of towns across North Kivu under the control of the M23, who international observers say are backed by neighbouring Rwanda. The mines in Rubaya hold about 15% of the world's coltan supply and half of the DR Congo's total deposits. The metallic ore contains tantalum, which is used to produce high-performance capacitors in a range of electronic devices, making it in high demand worldwide. When a BBC team visited the site in July 2025, they observed miners digging manually to source the precious mineral. Conditions at the site are very bad, with dangerous pits dotted around its vast expanse. Since 2024, the M23 rebels have been in control of the mines. The UN has accused the group of imposing taxes on the mining sector for their own benefit. The BBC has contacted the Congolese government in Kinshasa for comment.

**Excerpt**

Pokémon cancels event at controversial Japan shrine following backlash A Pokémon card game event at a shrine honouring Japan's war dead has been cancelled following a backlash in China. The Pokémon Company apologised for advertising the event, organised by a certified third party, through its official website, and said it "should not have been held in the first place". The event was due to be held on Saturday at the Yasukuni Shrine, near the Imperial Palace in Tokyo, which commemorates those who died in several wars including convicted war criminals. The blunder comes at a moment of worsening relations between China and Japan over the stance of the latter's new prime minister on Taiwan. The Yasukuni Shrine honours Japanese soldiers who died in a number of wars, including both Sino-Japanese wars and the Pacific theatre of World War Two. But the enshrinement of the names of more than 1,000 convicted war criminals among the roughly 2.5 million people it honours has long made it a controversial site for nations that were subject to harsh treatment under Japanese occupation. "Brands that disregard history and hurt the feelings of the Chinese people will ultimately be abandoned," the People's Daily, the Chinese Communist Party's official news site, commented when the event came to light earlier this week. "The relevant enterprises must accordingly take social responsibility and not make light of the heavy weight of history in the name of entertainment." Meanwhile, the state-run Global Times praised "China's young netizens" for criticising the event, adding: "Any entertainment or leisure activities held at such a site constitute an open affront to historical truth, and staging events aimed at children there is even more egregious." The Pokémon Company said in a statement on Friday that the event had been "mistakenly posted" on its official card game website "due to a lack of due diligence". "After the incident was discovered, the event was promptly cancelled," it said. "We sincerely apologise for the various reactions and opinions that have been generated as a result of this publication." The firm said it would "thoroughly review and strengthen" its approval process to prevent a similar incident from occurring again. The incident comes after a row with China sparked by Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's suggestion in November that Tokyo could respond with its own self-defence force if China attacked Taiwan. Beijing claims the self-governing island as part of its territory, and has not ruled out taking it by force. The row saw the governments of both nations urge their citizens not to travel to the other, while the release of two popular Japanese films in China were also postponed. Pokémon, which began as a video game in 1996, has since become an internationally renowned media franchise spanning films, TV series and trading card games.

### 6. [Israel split over plans to bring back death penalty for deadly attacks](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clymp8v7ye2o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

Israel split over plans to bring back death penalty for deadly attacks Israel has only twice used the death penalty against a convicted prisoner. The last time was more than sixty years ago, to hang the notorious Nazi war criminal, Adolf Eichmann. But in the wake of the Hamas-led attacks on 7 October 2023, Israel's deadliest ever day, there is a political push to pass a highly controversial new capital punishment law, targeting Palestinians convicted by Israeli courts of fatal terrorist attacks. "It's another brick in the wall of our defence," the far-right chair of the parliamentary national security committee, Zvika Fogel tells me. "To bring in the death penalty is the most moral, the most Jewish and the most decent thing." But human rights groups see the bill as "one of the most extreme legislative proposals" in the history of Israel. They argue it is unethical, and because it is designed to apply only to Palestinians, they say it will bring about "racialized capital punishment." There have been heated hearings in Israel's parliament involving rabbis, doctors, lawyers and security officials. Families whose loved ones were killed in the brutal assault on southern Israel more than two years ago, and in the fighting in the devastating war in Gaza that followed, have turned out to speak against and in favour of the legislation. "In my view, only 10 or 20 per cent of the law is intended for justice, and the remaining percentage is deterrence and prevention," says bereaved mother, Dr Valentina Gusak, who backs the bill. Addressing the national security committee, she displayed a photo of her 21-year-old daughter, Margarita who hoped to study medicine like both of her parents. She was killed with her boyfriend, Simon Vigdergaus as they fled the Nova music festival in 2023. "It's preventive treatment – that's what it's called in medicine," says Dr Gusak about reintroducing capital punishment who believes it could have saved her daughter's life. "It's a vaccine against the next murder, and we must ensure the future of our children." The death penalty does exist for certain crimes in Israel, but on the rare occasions when military courts previously handed down death sentences to convicted terrorists or enemy fighters, all were mitigated to life sentences following appeals. The Eichmann case was exceptional. The SS Lieutenant Colonel was an architect of the Holocaust. In 1960, he was snatched from Argentina by Israeli secret service agents before being put on a lengthy public trial before a special court in Jerusalem. Prior to that, a military captain, Meir Tobianski, was executed for treason following a makeshift court martial in June 1948, shortly after the Israeli state was established. He was posthumously exonerated. Opponents of capital punishment have rejected it on religious, ethical and legal grounds arguing it goes against Jewish law, violates the right to life and brings a risk of executing innocent people. But Israeli human rights groups also argue that the proposed new law will deepen discrimination by targeting only Palestinians convicted of terrorism and not Jewish Israelis. "The fact that we're even re-discussing bringing this back into the legal system in Israel is itself a low point," says Tal Steiner, executive director of the Israeli NGO, HaMoked. "Beyond that our objection is that the law is racially designed, meant to apply only to Palestinians, never to Jews, only to people who kill Israeli citizens, never for example to Israeli citizens who kill Palestinians. The motivation is clear." The stated purpose of the draft legislation is to protect Israel, "its citizens and its residents", while "increasing deterrence against the enemy" and reducing the incentive "to carry out kidnappings or take hostages in order to negotiate the release of terrorists" as well as "providing retribution" for criminal acts. Mandatory death sentences would apply in Israeli military courts which exclusively try Palestinians from the occupied West Bank. After a compulsory appeal against the verdict, those convicted of deadly terrorist attacks would be hanged within 90 days. The bill would also allow the death penalty to be used within the same swift time frame in regular Israeli courts, but it would not be mandatory. There have been past proposals to introduce capital punishment for what are seen as terrorist actions, but the security establishment was previously among the main opponents of such a move, asserting that it increased tensions and was not an effective deterrent. Already, a high number of Palestinians who carry out deadly attacks on Israelis are shot dead in the process by the security forces or armed civilians. When I meet Zvika Fogel from the far-right Jewish Power party which has put forward the new death penalty bill, he insists that the current heads of Israel's security services are behind its efforts. He dismisses the idea that the law is unfair. "Let's be accurate, my bill talks about terrorists and about an act of terrorism, there's no discrimination here. The definition is very clear," he says. "It's true that I don't think there's such a thing as a Jewish terrorist or a Jewish act of terrorism. It's a legal definition. I didn't go any other way." Jewish Power put forward the new death penalty bill early in 2023. Following the 7 October attacks, the legislation was put on hold because security officials advised it could jeopardise efforts to bring back the 251 hostages – living and dead – who had been seized and were being held in Gaza by Palestinian armed groups. Last year, the head of Jewish Power, the national security minister, Itamar Ben Gvir was one of the few ministers to vote against the US-brokered Gaza ceasefire deal which saw the last remaining hostages returned in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees – about 250 of whom were serving life or lengthy sentences, many for killing Israelis. He said he was opposed to all hostage agreements. Jewish Power then threatened to leave the government if the death penalty legislation was not put to a vote. Last November, when it passed the first of three readings needed to become law by 39-16, in the 120-seat parliament or Knesset, Ben Gvir gave out sweets. His party insists capital punishment will reduce the incentive for future hostage taking and prevent contentious prisoner swaps. Its members of parliament have taken to wearing a golden noose-shaped lapel pin. "There won't be any [more] prisoners released," says Zvika Fogel. "For a prisoner who committed murder, there'll be a death penalty so there won't be a prisoner to make a deal on. It will prevent hostages being taken to be used as bargaining chips." In parliament, Limor Son Har-Melech, another member of Jewish Power who sponsors the bill has related her personal story. In 2003, she and her husband - who lived in a West Bank settlement - were attacked by Palestinian gunmen while in their car. Her husband was killed and she was injured, leading her to give birth by an emergency caesarean section. Son Har-Melech explains that one of her husband's killers went on to be released in a previous exchange deal to bring home an Israeli soldier held captive in Gaza. She says he went on to command a deadly attack on another Israeli and take part in the 7 October attacks, before he was killed during the Gaza war. Some 1,200 people were killed in the shocking assault on southern Israel just over two years ago. It triggered the deadliest ever war in Gaza, where more than 71,600 Palestinians have been killed according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry. Many see that the public mood in Israel has shifted in favour of more draconian punishments. But Arab-Israeli parliamentarian, Aida Touma-Suleiman, who represents the opposition Hadash party, says legislators should be careful how they respond. "He is feeding into the revenge and the anger that is existing among society," she says of Ben Gvir. "But you cannot run legislation and courts by instincts of revenge." Touma-Suleiman opposes the death penalty on principle and argues the bill also goes against international law and past treaties signed by Israel. If the legislation passes two more parliamentary votes and becomes law, she believes Supreme Court judges will strike it down. However, she points out that this will prove a political point for Jewish Power in an election year. As part of the government, it has been taking steps to try to reduce the power of the courts. "It's a win-win situation for Ben Gvir and his party to promote such a law. Because if this law actually passes, it's for their constituency," Touma-Suleiman tells me. "If he managed to pass it then I'm sure the Supreme Court will ask the Knesset to cancel the law, and he can start to say with the rest of the right-wing: 'You see they want to run the country when we are the ones who are elected!'" In social media videos shot in Israeli jails, Ben Gvir has posed with bound and blindfolded prisoners who are said to be members of the Hamas Nukhba force which carried out the 7 October attacks. He boasts that they receive the "minimum of minimum conditions." According to a recent article by the Israeli news site, Walla, a record high number of 110 Palestinian security detainees have died under the minister's policies in the past two and a half years. The UN Committee against Torture said late last year that it was deeply concerned about reports indicating "a de facto state policy of organised and widespread torture and ill treatment" of Palestinians held in Israeli prisons. It said such allegations had "gravely intensified" after the 2023 attacks. Israel has denied the claims. While the final text of the death penalty law is being drawn up, another parliamentary committee is working on a separate bill to set up a dedicated military tribunal for the Nukhba prisoners. They are expected to face charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity much as Eichmann did six decades ago. Those convicted could also face the death penalty. After many countries around the world abolished capital punishment, Israel is taking steps in the opposite direction.

UN risks 'imminent financial collapse', secretary general warns The United Nations is at risk of "imminent financial collapse" due to member states not paying their fees, the body's head has warned. António Guterres said the UN faced a financial crisis which was "deepening, threatening programme delivery", and that money could run out by July. He wrote in a letter to all 193 member states that they had to honour their mandatory payments or overhaul the organisation's financial rules to avoid collapse. It comes after the UN's largest contributor, the US, refused to contribute to its regular and peacekeeping budgets, and withdrew from several agencies it called a "waste of taxpayer dollars". Several other members are in arrears or are simply refusing to pay. Though the UN General Assembly did approve a partial change to its financial system in late 2025, the organisation still faces a massive cash crisis compounded by a rule that means it is refunding money it never received. At its headquarters in Geneva, signs warning of the situation have been put up everywhere. In an almost desperate attempt to save cash, the escalators are regularly turned off and the heating turned down. Guterres wrote in his letter that the UN had faced financial crises in the past but that the current situation was "categorically different". "Decisions not to honour assessed contributions that finance a significant share of the approved regular budget have now been formally announced," the secretary general said, without naming specific members. He said the "integrity of the entire system" depended on states adhering to their obligation under the UN charter to pay their "assessed contributions" - adding that 77% of the total owed had been paid in 2025, leaving a record amount unpaid. Guterres said a rule that the UN must return unspent money on particular programmes to members if it could not implement a budget created a "double blow" in which it was "expected to give back cash that does not exist". "I cannot overstate the urgency of the situation we now face. We cannot execute budgets with uncollected funds, nor return funds we never received." As a result, the UN is now returning millions of dollars it never actually had. The letter reads: "Just this month, as part of the 2026 assessment, we were compelled to return $227m [£165m] – funds we have not collected." "The bottom line is clear," Guterres wrote. "Either all member states honour their obligations to pay in full and on time – or member states must fundamentally overhaul our financial rules to prevent an imminent financial collapse." UN agencies rarely get all the money they ask for to tackle humanitarian crises, but the past 12 months have been particularly difficult. The US is the UN's largest contributor, but President Donald Trump has said it was not fulfilling its "great potential" and has criticised it for failing to support US-led peace efforts. The US did not pay its contribution to the UN's regular budget in 2025 and offered only 30% of its expected funding to UN peacekeeping operations. Then in January, Trump withdrew it from dozens of international organisations, including 31 UN agencies, to "end American taxpayer funding and involvement in entities that advance globalist agendas over US priorities". In late December, the US pledged $2bn (£1.5bn) in funding for UN humanitarian programmes - warning the international organisation must "adapt or die" - a fraction of the $17bn it spent in 2022. Other countries, such as the UK and Germany, have also announced significant reductions in foreign aid, which will inevitably impact the UN's work. Guterres had warned earlier that same month that the UN faced its most fragile financial position in years - again citing unpaid fees - having said in October that it faced a "race to bankruptcy". Trump has separately been accused by critics of seeking to replace some functions of the UN with his Board of Peace to oversee regeneration efforts in Gaza. The US president has said its work would happen "in conjunction with the United Nations" - but when previously asked by a Fox TV journalist whether the board would take the UN's place, he replied: "Well, it might." The US officially left the UN's World Health Organization last week. It had refused to pay its 2024 and 2025 dues despite, WHO lawyers say, being legally obliged to do so. Other agencies are also making huge cuts. The UN's human rights office has warned that serious violations will now go undocumented because it lacks the funds to deploy investigators. In the past, their evidence has led to prosecutions for war crimes and crimes against humanity. In Afghanistan, which has one of the highest rates of maternal mortality in the world, UN Women has had to close mother and baby clinics. Meanwhile, the World Food Programme has had to cut rations to refugees fleeing the conflict in Sudan.

### 8. [Luigi Mangione will not face death penalty if convicted, judge rules](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c78egdg3r0po?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

Luigi Mangione will not face death penalty if convicted, judge rules Luigi Mangione, the man accused of gunning down UnitedHealthcare chief executive Brian Thompson, will not face the death penalty if convicted, a court has ruled. US District Judge Margaret Garnett dismissed the federal firearms charges against the 27-year-old that carried the possibility of capital punishment. He will still face stalking charges, which can bring a maximum sentence of life in prison. Mangione was arrested days after he allegedly shot Thompson as the health insurance firm CEO walked into a New York City hotel on 4 December 2024. He has pleaded not guilty to all federal and state charges. After the ruling, Mangione's attorney Karen Agnifilo thanked the court for "this incredible decision", according to the BBC's US partner CBS News. "We're all very relieved," she said. "We're prepared, and have been prepared, to fight this case, and we look forward to fighting this case." In her ruling, Garnett, an appointee of former US President Joe Biden, said two of the four federal charges did not meet "the federal statutory definition of a 'crime of violence' as matter of law". She noted that her decision was "solely to foreclose the death penalty as an available punishment to be considered by the jury". Garnett's ruling was a setback for the justice department, which had called Thompson's murder a "premeditated, cold-blooded assassination". The judge has given the government 30 days to challenge her decision to rule out the death penalty in the case. In a win for prosecutors, Garnett said they could present evidence to the jury from Mangione's backpack that he had at the time of his arrest at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania. Among the items in the bag were a gun, fake IDs and a notebook with writings that allegedly detailed Mangione's grievances against the US healthcare system. Defence attorneys had sought to dismiss that evidence from trial, arguing that authorities obtained it illegally without a warrant. Mangione, an Ivy League graduate from a wealthy Maryland family, is also facing nine charges in a separate case brought by New York state prosecutors, including second-degree murder. Thompson, a 50-year-old father of two, was shot from behind by a masked gunman as he walked into a Manhattan hotel for an annual investor conference. Investigators say the words "deny", "defend" and "depose" were written on shell casings found at the scene of Thompson's murder. Law enforcement sources say this may have been a reference to the "three Ds of insurance" - tactics used by companies to reject payment claims by patients. Jury selection in the federal trial is due to begin on 8 September, with opening statements due to start on 13 October. But state prosecutors are seeking to try Mangione as soon as July. In a separate incident, a Minnesota man was arrested on Wednesday for allegedly impersonating an FBI agent in an attempt to free Mangione from the Brooklyn jail he is being held in. The suspect - Mark Anderson - was carrying a barbecue fork and pizza cutter, prosecutors say. He is now being held at the same facility as Mangione.

### 9. [Israel eyes regime change in Iran - and is counting on Trump to make it happen](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c78egvpkm77o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

Israel eyes regime change in Iran - and is counting on Trump to make it happen Amid the din of global speculation over US military build-up in the Middle East, Israel's leaders have remained unusually silent. Aside from some remarks in support of Iran's anti-government protests this month, Israel's prime minister has had little to say publicly about his superpower ally taking on his biggest enemy. His government has remained equally silent. "It shows you the importance Netanyahu puts on this moment," said Danny Citrinowicz, who served for 25 years in Israel's Defence Intelligence, and is now senior Iran researcher at Israel's Institute for National Security Studies. "For Netanyahu, being in this position where the US has so many forces in the Gulf, being so close to Trump attacking Iran, this is - for him - a golden moment in time that he cannot forgo." Asaf Cohen, a former deputy director of Israel's signals intelligence unit, says there's strategy in Israel's silence too. "The [Israeli] leadership believes we should allow the Americans to lead the way this time, because they are stronger, have more capabilities, and have much more legitimacy in the world." Benjamin Netanyahu has long seen Iran as the key threat facing Israel, and the biggest source of instability in the Middle East. His public silence does not signal a lack of private discussion with his key US ally. This week, Israel's military intelligence chief, Shlomi Binder, met US intelligence agencies in Washington. According to Israeli media, the discussion focused on possible targets in Iran. Citrinowicz believes Netanyahu is privately pushing the US towards maximalist strikes aimed at regime change in Iran, and that when Netanyahu reportedly urged Trump to hold back earlier this month, he says, it was because he viewed the planned US attack as "too small". Netanyahu has previously urged Iranians to "stand up" to their regime, in an interview with Fox News last year. US president Donald Trump is currently considering a range of actions against Iran – they are reported to include both limited symbolic strikes and full-blown regime change. In public, he has alternated military threats with the offer of fresh negotiations. While many US allies are warning that trying to unseat Iran's leadership carries huge risks for the region, many in Israel see potential benefits for their security. By changing the regime in Tehran, Israel would hope to end the threat from Iran's ballistic missiles, and the possibility that it would one day acquire nuclear weapons too. It would also further weaken Iran's proxy militia around the region, including Hezbollah, which still has up to 25,000 missiles and rockets across the border in Lebanon according to Israel's Alma research institute. In contrast, some Israeli lawmakers believe a limited strike, or even a new deal with Iran, could carry bigger risks for Israel's security by leaving the regime in place. "When you deal with total evil, you don't act limited," said Moshe Tur-Paz, a member of the Yesh Atid opposition party who sits on the Defence Committee of Israel's parliament. "There's a consensus that Israel should act much stronger and so should the Western world. When it comes to our worst enemies like Iran, there are no big differences. We all understand the threat." Another round of conflict that left the regime intact would not be worth the price paid in Iran's retaliation, many say. During the 12-day war last year, when Israel and the US attacked Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile sites, Iran fired back hundreds of ballistic missiles at Israeli towns and cities. Some evaded Israel's vaunted air-defences, slamming into apartment blocks in Tel Aviv and killing at least 28 people. The Israeli military had prepared for many more casualties, but Tehran's heightened sense of vulnerability now could mean a more intense response. And analysts have suggested that Iran learned from that conflict, adapting its tactics as the war progressed. Half a year on, Iran is rebuilding its missile stocks. This week, a senior adviser to Iran's Supreme Leader warned on social media that Tel Aviv would be hit with an "immediate and unprecedented" response in the event of any US attack. "Netanyahu is afraid Israel will [again] go through the pain of an attack without a change of regime," said Citrinowicz. "He came to the conclusion that to stop the missiles being built, you have to have regime change, but regime change can happen only with the US." And this moment of intense vulnerablity for the Iranian regime – its military defences diminished after the 12-day war, its regional proxy forces weakened, and after widespread protests against its rule at home – also represents an opportunity, says Cohen. "Iran is at its weakest now - this is an opportunity that may not come again," said Cohen. "There are a lot of people who believe this is the time - it's now or never." In Tel Aviv, residents still living with the wreckage from Iranian missile strikes last June are speculating about another conflict. "I hope [our leaders] don't miss this opportunity," said Neria, a young man in his early 20s. "If it's through attack or through other means, I don't know, but certainly we should leverage the situation to switch regimes. It won't be the first time we'll deal with the bombs - it's not nice, but if it's going to help us in the longer term to feel safer here then we will have to go through it". Shani, a young woman nearby, said she had mixed feelings. "I know the Iranian people - many of them - want the US to help. I just hope that everyone will stay safe," she said. "Politicians need to think about the people. Actions have consequences." Israeli polls repeatedly show a strong majority of Jewish residents support military action against Iran - including after the 12-day war last year. But the risks of regime change remain. With no obvious cracks in the military and clerical alliance around Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and a splintered opposition movement in the country, it's not clear who would take over control of Iran if the government fell. A younger successor from the same ruling elite would not necessarily be more flexible in their response to Israel, and the chaos of a civil war would not only be deeply destabilising for Iranians, but for the region as a whole. And several defence insiders have pointed out that regimes are not usually toppled by air-strikes alone. Israel's prime minister, facing elections this year, has worked hard since the Hamas attacks to try and restore his broken image as Israel's "Mr Security". Regime change in Iran – or Khamanei's assassination - would be a political prize, but also a risk. "It is a gamble, but it's a calculated one," says Citrinowicz. "Netanyahu couldn't care less what happens the day after Khamenei. He wants to show, together with Trump, that he destroyed the Iranian regime. It's a risk he's willing to take if he knows the Americans will go all the way. The problem is Trump." Both the US and Iran have said they are open to negotiations, but Trump has conditioned talks on ending Iran's uranium enrichment along with its support for proxies in the region, and limits on its ballistic missiles – all seen as red lines for the regime. Israel's leadership is firmly against a deal, and Israeli analysts are divided over whether one is even achievable. Cohen said he thought both Washington and Tehran wanted an agreement, but that if one wasn't reached soon the US would strike. "Iran's Supreme Leader and Trump have something in common. There aren't really any red lines. During the negotiations in 2013, we used to called them 'pink lines', because they changed," said Cohen. "We always talk about Iran as evil, but they are very rational," he said. "I think they understand that in order to change the situation, they need to do something that hasn't been done until now." "Yes, the ability to show compromise is there, they're not North Korea, but this regime has its red lines," countered Citrinowicz, warning that a war would be hard to contain "because Iranians will think it's a war for their survival". There are signs that Trump may be limiting his conditions for negotiations and focusing on Iran's nuclear programme. If the bar is lowered enough for Tehran to begin talks, much of the region will breathe a sigh of relief - and many in Israel will hold their breath. Cohen says there are ways of constructing compromises on issues such as enrichment that could temporarily prevent any new activity in practice while allowing Iran to avoid an explicit ban. "The essential difference between us and the Iranians is we like quick results, and the Iranians have great patience," he said. "They say: 'we've been here 2000 years, if we need another 30 years to get a nuclear weapon, it's ok'."
