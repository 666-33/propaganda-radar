**Excerpt**

What we learned - and didn't - from the Melania documentary From televised cabinet meetings to late night Truth Social posts, US President Donald Trump has rarely stepped out of the spotlight since he resumed office in January. But more often than not, he's done it without his wife. So where is Melania? A new documentary co-produced by the first lady herself aims to answer that question. Melania: 20 Days to History promises viewers an intimate glimpse into Melania Trump's life in the days leading up to her husband's January 2025 inauguration. The film opened in cinemas across the US on Friday amid controversy. It has received significant attention from administration critics and watchdogs, who have criticised the project's funding and dismissed the timing of its release as insensitive as mass protests swell over two fatal shootings by federal agents in Minneapolis. Politics aside, those seeking answers about how Trump spends her time might find the film unsatisfying - much of it shows her in transit, at public events or drifting between meetings to review fabric samples and dinnerware. Still, small interactions with her closest friends offer some glimpses at how the famously enigmatic first lady is approaching her husband's second term. "Everyone wants to know, so here it is," she says in an opening voiceover. Here's what we've learned from watching the film - and what we didn't. Fleeting off-script moments Early on, Trump is clear about her intent: "I want to show the American people my journey from private citizen to first lady." The film touches briefly on the controversy around its creation, in a meta moment that shows Trump's staff fielding an inquiry from a journalist about its commission. It is a co-production from Trump herself and director Brett Ratner, along with other partners, and distribution by Amazon MGM Studios. The film is Ratner's first project since he was accused of sexual misconduct at the height of the #MeToo movement in 2017. Ratner has denied the allegations. Much of the film takes place at Trump Tower in New York, at the president's Florida residence at Mar-a-Lago or en route between the two. We see little of either property, just the spaces in which Trump meets her trusted staff of stylists, event planners and interior decorators. At several points, Ratner intervenes to prod Trump into sharing more about herself. What kind of music does she like? Michael Jackson is her favourite, she reveals during a car ride to the airport - especially "Billie Jean", which plays twice during the film. The pair listen to the song and she briefly sings along. "Are we doing Carpool Karaoke with Melania?" Ratner excitedly asks. Her most personal struggle Trump is most candid about her mother's death, describing the grief as overwhelming. Amalija Knavs died in January 2024. She first opens up to an interior decorator when discussing plans for the Trump family to move into the White House. Her grief appears to swell when she attends the funeral of former President Jimmy Carter in Washington DC on 9 January 2025, the anniversary of her mother's death. She describes sitting in the Washington National Cathedral, present for Carter but "my beloved mother will be on my mind". Knavs, she says, was the "richest thread of my life". Donald Trump remarks to the camera that his wife had a "hard time" with her mother's death. After the funeral, Melania Trump proceeds directly from one cathedral to another, St Patrick's Cathedral in Manhattan, to light a candle in her mother's honour. Inside her small inner circle Her husband appears sparingly, emerging at key events and in a handful of private moments to praise her. Perhaps her warmest relationships are seen with her long-time stylist, Hervé Pierre, and France's First Lady Brigitte Macron. "I go everywhere with you, we are connected on many subjects," Macron tells her. While Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron have navigated a rocky relationship, the two first ladies praised each other in a video call discussing their mutual concern with youth anxiety and social media use. In contrast, her meetings with Pierre, who designed many of her looks for the inauguration, focus on finer details - an eighth of a inch on a collar or the cut of a lapel. When asked about her friendship with Pierre, she says the two have worked together for years because they have "great energy and vision" together. Pierre tells the camera that he feels they speak the same language - the language of details and design, owing to Trump's history as a model and her strong opinions on how her clothes fit. What we don't see is the wider Trump family, or its dynamics. The Trump children only appear in the crowd at his swearing-in. Though Melania Trump speaks warmly of her son Barron, he appears to avoid the camera - abruptly walking away when the family enters the White House together. "It is very important that he lives the life he wants to live," she says. Complicated role of first lady Throughout the film, Trump hints at discomfort with her new role, at times seeming to mourn the loss of her privacy and freedom to the rigid and public obligations of being first lady. The role of first lady is "more structured" and comes with "fewer quiet moments", she says, and she feels she must stay "mentally strong". The documentary hints at the tumult of the 2024 presidential election and the toll of Donald Trump's campaign. But Melania Trump largely avoids offering her own perspective. She directs much of the attention back to Donald Trump, echoing her husband's public statements that he has endured grave injustice. "Nobody has endured what he has for the last few years," she says in a voice over. "Here he is, I'm so very proud." She describes her job as first lady as one of juggling obligations. "You have your schedule, the White House schedule, the president's schedule," she says. "You need to be a mother, wife, daughter, friend." Watching the news, she expresses genuine sadness at reports of a tragedy or children with high screen time, but holds off on offering opinions or specific policy goals as first lady. She views footage of the Palisades fire burning in Los Angeles, lamenting the cost to "the families". The scene cuts to her walking into a meeting with Aviva Siegel, an Israeli woman who was taken hostage in the Hamas-led attack on Israel on 7 October 2023. Her husband Keith was still in captivity at the time of filming, but was later released in Feburary 2025. Trump hugs Siegel as she cries. "I will pray that he doesn't suffer," she says, noting that her husband will be in office in a few days' time and could help. "I will always use my influence and power to fight for those in need," she says. Reactions divided by politics Documentaries have become a key part of the celebrity PR toolkit in the last decade. Where social media can be unpredictable, self-produced documentaries by the likes of Taylor Swift, Demi Lovato and Selena Gomez offer a revenue stream, fan service and a unique degree of image control, all with the promise of intimacy. At a Friday afternoon showing at a cinema outside of Washington DC attended by the BBC, the audience was filled with a mostly older crowd dressed in American flag attire, who cheered and clapped throughout the film. This is part of why Trump may have chosen this kind of project, says Katherine Jellison, a women's studies professor and expert in first ladies at Ohio University. "As she said in her own memoir, she resents that others defined her the first time around," Jellison told the BBC. But unlike the glossy productions before it, the film's ties to the Trump administration - and more importantly, its politics - have coloured perceptions even before its release. A private screening at the White House attended by conservative influencer Erika Kirk and Apple CEO Tim Cook came hours after federal agents shot and killed Alex Pretti in Minneapolis. Critics of the Trump administration labelled the opulent event as insensitive and out of touch. In Los Angeles, protesters vandalised public advertisements promoting the film. On review websites, they posted scathing ratings before the film was even released - a practice known as review-bombing. The film's funding by Amazon has also drawn criticism, at a time when several billionaires and business leaders, including the company's founder Jeff Bezos, have sought to strengthen their ties to the White House. Amazon spent $35m (£25m) on marketing, on top of around $40m for the rights to the film, according to media reports. Industry veterans have described it as an uncommonly expensive documentary. "How can it not be equated with currying favour or an outright bribe? How can that not be the case?" a former Amazon employee, who helped the company start its film division, told the New York Times. But in the film itself, Melania Trump seems to largely remove herself from the political concerns of the White House, preferring to focus on the fine details of the dinners and dresses to come. In one moment, Donald Trump calls to encourage her to watch a recent appearance of his. She declines, drawing chuckles in the cinema. "I will see it on the news," she tells him. Her final take on her position, offered towards the end of the film, describes the role as an exercise in personal growth: "As first lady, the real nobility is becoming stronger than the person I was yesterday."

US government partially shuts down despite last minute funding deal The US federal government has partially shutdown despite a last-ditch funding deal approved by the Senate. The funding lapse began at midnight US eastern time (05:00 GMT) on Saturday, hours after senators agreed to fund most agencies until September. The bill includes just two weeks' funding for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees immigration enforcement, instead of shutting it down entirely. The bill has yet to be approved by the House of Representatives, which is out of session. US President Donald Trump struck the deal with Democrats after they refused to give more funding for immigration enforcement following the fatal shooting of two US citizens in Minneapolis by federal agents. It is the second such government shutdown in the past year and comes just 11 weeks after the end of the previous funding impasse that lasted 43 days, the longest in US history. That shutdown in 2025, which spanned 1 October to 14 November, had widespread impacts on essential government services including air travel and left hundreds of thousands of federal workers without pay for weeks. This shutdown, however, is unlikely to be that long or widespread as the House of Representatives is set to be back in session on Monday. The White House, though, has directed several agencies, including the departments of transportation, education and defence to execute shutdown plans. "Employees should report to work for their next regularly scheduled tour of duty to undertake orderly shutdown activities," a White House memo to agencies said. "It is our hope that this lapse will be short." Trump has urged Republicans, who hold the majority of seats in the US House, to vote for the deal. Lawmakers plan to use the fortnight in which the DHS will continue to be funded to negotiate a deal. Democrats want that deal to include new policies for immigration enforcement agents. "We need to rein in ICE and end the violence," Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. "That means ending roving patrols. It means requiring rules, oversight, and judicial warrants... Masks need to come off, cameras need to stay on, and officers need visible identification. No secret police." Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have sharply criticised tactics used by immigration agents in the wake of the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis last weekend. Pretti, an intensive care nurse, was shot by a US Border Patrol agent after an altercation in which several agents tried to restrain him. On Friday, the Justice Department launched a civil rights investigation into the shooting.

**Excerpt**

'A vaccine against murder'? Israel split over return of death penalty Israel has only twice used the death penalty against a convicted prisoner. The last time was more than sixty years ago, to hang the notorious Nazi war criminal, Adolf Eichmann. But in the wake of the Hamas-led attacks on 7 October 2023, Israel's deadliest ever day, there is a political push to pass a highly controversial new capital punishment law, targeting Palestinians convicted by Israeli courts of fatal terrorist attacks. "It's another brick in the wall of our defence," the far-right chair of the parliamentary national security committee, Zvika Fogel tells me. "To bring in the death penalty is the most moral, the most Jewish and the most decent thing." But human rights groups see the bill as "one of the most extreme legislative proposals" in the history of Israel. They argue it is unethical, and because it is designed to apply only to Palestinians, they say it will bring about "racialized capital punishment." There have been heated hearings in Israel's parliament involving rabbis, doctors, lawyers and security officials. Families whose loved ones were killed in the brutal assault on southern Israel more than two years ago, and in the fighting in the devastating war in Gaza that followed, have turned out to speak against and in favour of the legislation. "In my view, only 10 or 20 per cent of the law is intended for justice, and the remaining percentage is deterrence and prevention," says bereaved mother, Dr Valentina Gusak, who backs the bill. Addressing the national security committee, she displayed a photo of her 21-year-old daughter, Margarita who hoped to study medicine like both of her parents. She was killed with her boyfriend, Simon Vigdergaus as they fled the Nova music festival in 2023. "It's preventive treatment – that's what it's called in medicine," says Dr Gusak about reintroducing capital punishment who believes it could have saved her daughter's life. "It's a vaccine against the next murder, and we must ensure the future of our children." The death penalty does exist for certain crimes in Israel, but on the rare occasions when military courts previously handed down death sentences to convicted terrorists or enemy fighters, all were mitigated to life sentences following appeals. The Eichmann case was exceptional. The SS Lieutenant Colonel was an architect of the Holocaust. In 1960, he was snatched from Argentina by Israeli secret service agents before being put on a lengthy public trial before a special court in Jerusalem. Prior to that, a military captain, Meir Tobianski, was executed for treason following a makeshift court martial in June 1948, shortly after the Israeli state was established. He was posthumously exonerated. Opponents of capital punishment have rejected it on religious, ethical and legal grounds arguing it goes against Jewish law, violates the right to life and brings a risk of executing innocent people. But Israeli human rights groups also argue that the proposed new law will deepen discrimination by targeting only Palestinians convicted of terrorism and not Jewish Israelis. "The fact that we're even re-discussing bringing this back into the legal system in Israel is itself a low point," says Tal Steiner, executive director of the Israeli NGO, HaMoked. "Beyond that our objection is that the law is racially designed, meant to apply only to Palestinians, never to Jews, only to people who kill Israeli citizens, never for example to Israeli citizens who kill Palestinians. The motivation is clear." The stated purpose of the draft legislation is to protect Israel, "its citizens and its residents", while "increasing deterrence against the enemy" and reducing the incentive "to carry out kidnappings or take hostages in order to negotiate the release of terrorists" as well as "providing retribution" for criminal acts. Mandatory death sentences would apply in Israeli military courts which exclusively try Palestinians from the occupied West Bank. After a compulsory appeal against the verdict, those convicted of deadly terrorist attacks would be hanged within 90 days. The bill would also allow the death penalty to be used within the same swift time frame in regular Israeli courts, but it would not be mandatory. There have been past proposals to introduce capital punishment for what are seen as terrorist actions, but the security establishment was previously among the main opponents of such a move, asserting that it increased tensions and was not an effective deterrent. Already, a high number of Palestinians who carry out deadly attacks on Israelis are shot dead in the process by the security forces or armed civilians. When I meet Zvika Fogel from the far-right Jewish Power party which has put forward the new death penalty bill, he insists that the current heads of Israel's security services are behind its efforts. He dismisses the idea that the law is unfair. "Let's be accurate, my bill talks about terrorists and about an act of terrorism, there's no discrimination here. The definition is very clear," he says. "It's true that I don't think there's such a thing as a Jewish terrorist or a Jewish act of terrorism. It's a legal definition. I didn't go any other way." Jewish Power put forward the new death penalty bill early in 2023. Following the 7 October attacks, the legislation was put on hold because security officials advised it could jeopardise efforts to bring back the 251 hostages – living and dead – who had been seized and were being held in Gaza by Palestinian armed groups. Last year, the head of Jewish Power, the national security minister, Itamar Ben Gvir was one of the few ministers to vote against the US-brokered Gaza ceasefire deal which saw the last remaining hostages returned in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees – about 250 of whom were serving life or lengthy sentences, many for killing Israelis. He said he was opposed to all hostage agreements. Jewish Power then threatened to leave the government if the death penalty legislation was not put to a vote. Last November, when it passed the first of three readings needed to become law by 39-16, in the 120-seat parliament or Knesset, Ben Gvir gave out sweets. His party insists capital punishment will reduce the incentive for future hostage taking and prevent contentious prisoner swaps. Its members of parliament have taken to wearing a golden noose-shaped lapel pin. "There won't be any [more] prisoners released," says Zvika Fogel. "For a prisoner who committed murder, there'll be a death penalty so there won't be a prisoner to make a deal on. It will prevent hostages being taken to be used as bargaining chips." In parliament, Limor Son Har-Melech, another member of Jewish Power who sponsors the bill has related her personal story. In 2003, she and her husband - who lived in a West Bank settlement - were attacked by Palestinian gunmen while in their car. Her husband was killed and she was injured, leading her to give birth by an emergency caesarean section. Son Har-Melech explains that one of her husband's killers went on to be released in a previous exchange deal to bring home an Israeli soldier held captive in Gaza. She says he went on to command a deadly attack on another Israeli and take part in the 7 October attacks, before he was killed during the Gaza war. Some 1,200 people were killed in the shocking assault on southern Israel just over two years ago. It triggered the deadliest ever war in Gaza, where more than 71,600 Palestinians have been killed according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry. Many see that the public mood in Israel has shifted in favour of more draconian punishments. But Arab-Israeli parliamentarian, Aida Touma-Suleiman, who represents the opposition Hadash party, says legislators should be careful how they respond. "He is feeding into the revenge and the anger that is existing among society," she says of Ben Gvir. "But you cannot run legislation and courts by instincts of revenge." Touma-Suleiman opposes the death penalty on principle and argues the bill also goes against international law and past treaties signed by Israel. If the legislation passes two more parliamentary votes and becomes law, she believes Supreme Court judges will strike it down. However, she points out that this will prove a political point for Jewish Power in an election year. As part of the government, it has been taking steps to try to reduce the power of the courts. "It's a win-win situation for Ben Gvir and his party to promote such a law. Because if this law actually passes, it's for their constituency," Touma-Suleiman tells me. "If he managed to pass it then I'm sure the Supreme Court will ask the Knesset to cancel the law, and he can start to say with the rest of the right-wing: 'You see they want to run the country when we are the ones who are elected!'" In social media videos shot in Israeli jails, Ben Gvir has posed with bound and blindfolded prisoners who are said to be members of the Hamas Nukhba force which carried out the 7 October attacks. He boasts that they receive the "minimum of minimum conditions." According to a recent article by the Israeli news site, Walla, a record high number of 110 Palestinian security detainees have died under the minister's policies in the past two and a half years. The UN Committee against Torture said late last year that it was deeply concerned about reports indicating "a de facto state policy of organised and widespread torture and ill treatment" of Palestinians held in Israeli prisons. It said such allegations had "gravely intensified" after the 2023 attacks. Israel has denied the claims. While the final text of the death penalty law is being drawn up, another parliamentary committee is working on a separate bill to set up a dedicated military tribunal for the Nukhba prisoners. They are expected to face charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity much as Eichmann did six decades ago. Those convicted could also face the death penalty. After many countries around the world abolished capital punishment, Israel is taking steps in the opposite direction.

### 4. [Canada's Poilievre re-elected Conservative party leader](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c14r1023yy6o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

Canada's Poilievre re-elected Conservative party leader Pierre Poilievre has been re-elected as Canada's Conservative Party leader, having received a strong endorsement from members despite presiding over recent electoral defeats. He secured 87.4% of votes in the leadership review, held on Friday in Calgary among delegates instead of the wider membership, after delivering a speech calling for Canadians to stay united in the face of an "uncertain world" and amid growing separatist sentiments in Alberta and Quebec. "A house divided cannot stand," Poilievre said. A leadership review is automatically triggered after an election loss - in this case Poilievre's defeat to Mark Carney's Liberals last April, in which he also lost his own seat. Despite the political setbacks, delegates who spoke to the BBC said that they still had confidence in Poilievre to lead them into the next election. Ahead of the vote, Poilievre delivered a nearly hour-long speech that doubled as a pitch to Conservative voters at the party's convention in Calgary, Alberta, where he outlined his vision for Canada's future should his party form the next government. He focused much of his messaging on affordability and crime - issues that have long resonated with his base - and promised a small government that would represent "people who have felt unseen for too long". Poilievre also touched on geopolitical tensions facing Canada, including its strained relationship with the US, arguing that the same domestic policies he was pitching will also help Canada "stand on its own two feet". His speech was made on a backdrop of a growing grassroots separatist movement in the Conservative stronghold of Alberta, where a process of collecting signatures to trigger an independence referendum is under way. In Quebec, the sovereignist Parti Québécois is also polling ahead, promising its own independence referendum in the province should it be elected to the provincial government later this year. Poilievre addressed these threats to Canadian unity in his speech, blaming the Liberal Party for people losing "hope in the confederation". Party members who spoke to the BBC said the speech was well received, praising it for sticking to traditional Conservative messaging while also confronting separatism - what one member called "the elephant in the room". Ballots in Friday's vote were cast in person by delegates who were selected to represent Conservative voters in each constituency across Canada. Poilievre has remained popular with his party despite the Conservative's unexpected loss last year, as well as the loss of the seat he had held for more than 20 years. He later won back a seat in parliament in an Alberta by-election, where he received more than 80% of the vote. In recent months, two elected Conservative MPs have left the party to join the Liberals, who under Carney have adopted more centrist policies, raising questions about the party's unity and Poilievre's leadership. But supporters of Poilievre credit him with delivering historic gains for the party, which received a record 41% of the popular vote last year. In particular, the Conservative leader has been successful in courting young voters through his messaging on affordability issues like the cost of living and housing. He has struggled, however, with defining his party's stance on US President Donald Trump, whom many Canadians have come to view as an existential threat due to his tariffs on Canadian goods and his rhetoric around it becoming the 51st US state. Poilievre has also struggled with his likeability, with surveys showing that more than half of Canadians hold a negative view of him. Many cite his tone, which they view as overly combative. Polls indicate his party is still trailing, with a Léger poll released this week showing the Conservatives nine points behind the Liberals.

### 5. [Trump picks Kevin Warsh to lead the US Federal Reserve](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2d7yddrl2xo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

Trump picks Kevin Warsh to lead the US Federal Reserve US President Donald Trump has picked Kevin Warsh to lead the US Federal Reserve when current chairman Jerome Powell's four-year term ends in May. Warsh is a former Fed governor and was considered for chair during Trump's first term. He has been an outspoken Fed critic and is expected to support lower interest rates in the near term. The appointment comes amid mounting worries about the Fed's independence, following Trump's increasing attacks on Powell in recent months. Powell has angered Trump by not cutting interest rates quickly enough, and federal prosecutors recently opened a criminal investigation over testimony he gave to the Senate about renovations to Fed buildings. The Department of Justice (DoJ) probe prompted a forceful condemnation from Powell and messages of support from former Fed chairs and central bank heads. Warsh, who served as a Fed governor from 2006 to 2011, had re-emerged in recent weeks as a potential choice for the top job as speculation grew over who would replace the under-fire incumbent. Announcing the nomination on Truth Social, Trump said Warsh "will go down as one of the GREAT Fed Chairmen, maybe the best". Warsh's appointment still needs to be approved by the Senate, meaning it could face lengthy delays. If confirmed for the role, he will take the helm of the Fed at an unusually tense time, as economists and Wall Street investors monitor threats to the central bank's autonomy. Who is Kevin Warsh? Warsh, a 55-year-old economist, is a fellow at the right-leaning Hoover Institution and serves on the board of courier UPS. He has been an outspoken Fed critic, lambasting everything from the central bank's heavy reliance on data to its use of assets on its balance sheet. Warsh has escalated his rhetoric since emerging as a contender for the top Fed job, going as far as calling for "regime change". He had a relatively "hawkish" reputation as a Fed governor, meaning he tended to favour higher interest rates and took more seriously concerns about inflation. But he is now seen as a voice that would support lower rates in the near term. He has argued the Fed should shrink its balance sheet in order to bring down short-term interest rates, though some have questioned his logic. The Fed this week voted to hold interest rates steady, despite the White House pushing for a cut. Policymakers are continuing to monitor the effect on the economy of last year's trio of interest rate cuts. There are signs the US employment market is stabilising - job creation is sluggish but the unemployment rate has ticked lower. Inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target. "Warsh will have to convince his colleagues that rate cuts are appropriate this year, an argument that is unlikely to win unless the labour market shows renewed signs of weakening or inflationary pressures ease materially later this year," economists at Deutsche Bank wrote in a research note on Friday. Warsh also has close family connections to Trump's orbit. He is married to Jane Lauder, whose family is known for the Estee Lauder cosmetics group. His father-in-law, billionaire businessman Ronald Lauder, is a long-time Trump donor and ally. Republican Senator Thom Tillis, a member of the Senate Banking Committee, has said he will oppose Trump's nominees until the potential legal case against Powell is resolved. Trump has also taken aim at Fed governor Lisa Cook, whom he wants to remove. He has accused her of engaging in mortgage fraud, which she has denied. The Supreme Court is now assessing the case. Warsh had been seen of one of four leading candidates for the Fed job. The other frontrunners were White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett, Fed governor Christopher Waller and Wall Street bond guru Rick Rieder. When Warsh takes up his role, financial markets will keep a close eye on how independently he acts of President Trump. Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said Warsh "seems like a relatively safe choice". "Warsh's long-running hawkish views should help to counteract concerns that he might morph into a full-blown Trump stooge," he added. As news of Warsh's impending nomination started to leak out, the dollar strengthened slightly while the price of gold sank by 6%. Stuart Clark, portfolio manager at wealth management business Quilter, said investors would be "breathing somewhat of a sigh of relief" at Warsh's nomination. "Warsh was in contention for the job back in 2017 and as such comes to the role with a level of authority that is respected across the market," he added. "Concerns around Fed independence and an erosion on this should now be tempered, although Warsh's words and actions will be scrutinised by market participants intensely."

### 6. [Ukrainians brace for -20C despite energy truce: 'It will be a catastrophe'](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c75xg17rr1xo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

Ukrainians brace for -20C despite energy truce: 'It will be a catastrophe' It's not the electricity cuts that Yulia Hailunas struggles with most after the Russian airstrikes. It's the fact that it's so bitterly cold inside her own home. Like so many Ukrainians, she's had no central heating since Russia launched a wave of targeted attacks on the power grid in January. So Yulia now lives in a long, quilted coat and hat in her flat, and rests her feet on a saucepan-full of hot water to keep them from freezing. If that's not enough, she lifts weights for 10 minutes to get warm. When the weather outside is above zero, it's just about bearable. But later this weekend, the temperature in Dnipro is forecast to plunge below -20C. In Kyiv and elsewhere, it could be colder still. "That's what's really scary, because all the heating pipes will burst and we won't be able to repair them again. It will be a catastrophe," Yulia worries. On Thursday, Donald Trump announced that Vladimir Putin had agreed to halt attacks on Ukraine's major cities during the "horrendously cold" snap, supposedly for a week. The US president called it "very nice" of his Russian counterpart to agree to an energy truce. But details were sparse from the start. The next day, the Kremlin clarified that Putin's burst of good will expires on Sunday, just as the coldest weather bites. There is usually a week or more gap between massive aerial attacks in any case, so it's unclear whether Russia has actually paused anything. There has been no major strike since 24 January, when hundreds of tower blocks in Kyiv lost power and heating. "It has been quieter for a bit, but I don't know if that's linked," a doubtful Yulia says, suspecting the strikes will restart at any moment. "I think Putin wants to turn people against their government, to have them say: 'Just give Russia anything to make this stop'," Yulia says. "He wants to break us, but it won't work." Ukraine's heating system is breaking down though. The Geneva Convention, the laws of war, bans attacks on infrastructure that cause excessive harm to civilians. But this is the fourth winter in a row that the energy grid has been targeted by Russia deliberately, leaving it more fragile and harder to repair after each successive strike. Engineers have been drafted in from Ukraine's national rail company and elsewhere, working around the clock to restore electricity, and to defrost and patch up the heating pipes that run beneath giant apartment blocks in Dnipro, Kyiv and beyond. An extended pause in strikes on the sector would provide a welcome break, but few Ukrainians trust Russia to deliver that. That's because, elsewhere, the deadly strikes have not stopped. On Friday, one person was killed and several injured when a bus in Kherson was hit by shelling, while there were multiple air raid warnings for drones. And all along the eastern frontline, the fighting is as intense as ever, still forcing civilians to flee their homes. In Pavlohrad, about 40 miles from the front, we found families dazed after evacuating, abandoning everything, with no idea whether they'll ever go back. They were queuing to register at a centre for the displaced, offered a small handout of cash, food and toiletries by volunteers. Kateryna cried as she told me how hard it had been to leave Vasylkivka, where she had lived all her life. "It's like abandoning a piece of yourself," she said. But she had to protect her two young children, scared by the explosions. "Our village wasn't touched at first, but now it's a total combat zone. The drones are hitting every day," her mother Iryna described the Russian advance. "One day there were 50 Shahed drones overhead." Trump sees the energy truce - a halt to massive aerial attacks on Ukraine's big cities - as a way of reducing tension as he pushes for progress in peace talks. He pledged to end this war "in a day" long ago but now admits doing so is difficult. Ukraine has agreed to mirror Moscow's actions by halting its own strikes on oil refineries in Russia and its shadow fleet of tankers that move Russian oil around the world, evading sanctions. The trade pumps vital money into Russia's war economy, but Kyiv wants to show Trump its willingness in his peace efforts. Another round of negotiations is scheduled to take place in the United Arab Emirates on Sunday, though it seems no senior US delegates will attend. The US has been talking up progress and Ukraine also claims only one major disagreement remains – albeit a critical one, over control of territory in the east. But Russian officials have been dampening expectations of a deal. "Of course we are following the talks, we want some stability," Iryna tells me people here long for peace more than anyone. "But how can we trust Russia not to stab us in the back?" From the dark and the cold of this war, it does feel to Ukrainians like Moscow is just toying with Trump. The next days and weeks will test that. Additional reporting by Mariana Matveichuk and Paul Pradier

Stay or go - what's next for coyote that escaped to Alcatraz? A lone coyote that swam more than a mile across the San Francisco Bay to Alcatraz Island is being monitored by scientists and could be moved if its presence threatens birds on the infamous Californian island. The canine, called Floyd, appears to be thriving on The Rock - renowned for its abandoned prison - and getting by on an avian diet. Whether Floyd can stay on Alcatraz "depends entirely on how it behaves", says Aidan Moore, a local tour guide who shared footage of the coyote's journey. Complicating matters, he adds, is that there are no fresh water sources, which could make the animal's welfare dependent on human intervention. Video of Floyd - believed to be a male - hopping onto Alcatraz's rocks was captured by a tourist and shared with Moore. The gaunt coyote appeared to be shivering from the bay water, which is about 10C (50F). But he has plumped up since, says Moore, who is originally from the Cotswolds in England. On Saturday, the Golden Gate National Recreation Area (GGNRA) observed and photographed the coyote. It confirmed to the BBC that the animal was believed to be the same coyote seen swimming ashore on the island nearly two weeks earlier. This is the first documented coyote presence on Alcatraz since the island was transferred to the National Park Service in 1972, the GGNRA said. Park biologists and staff are actively monitoring the coyote to better understand how it is surviving on the 22-acre (89,030 sqm) island and to assess any potential impacts to the seabird breeding colony, the GGNRA said. The coyote's presence, it added, does not affect public access to the island, which remains open to visitors. Alcatraz island - nicknamed "the Rock" because it was regarded as an impregnable fortress - is home to the shuttered federal penitentiary that housed some of the most dangerous criminals in the US. It also served as the backdrop to the eponymous 1996 action thriller starring Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage, and the 1979 drama Escape from Alcatraz with Clint Eastwood. Coyotes - wolf-like creatures that are native to North America - are not uncommon in the San Francisco Bay. According to Moore, nearby Angel Island has at least 16 coyotes that are thriving there because there's fresh water and bigger prey, such as deer, that they can hunt. But not so on Alcatraz, part of Golden Gate National Recreation Area, and a registered sanctuary for seabirds, whose sensitive nesting time runs from February through to September. Floyd has to be able to catch enough birds to sustain his dietary needs, Moore says, and suspects that catching them is like shooting fish in a barrel given the thousands of birds there. Floyd might also be staying hydrated with rain puddles and water from the gardens on the island, said Janet Kessler, a self-taught naturalist who has been documenting coyote behaviour in San Francisco for about 20 years. She tells the BBC that she suspects Floyd made the journey because he might have felt interspecies territorial pressure in the city and needed to find a new area to call home. "He can't go anywhere. When he gets to a territory, they're going to drive him out of that territory, because that's what coyotes do," Kessler says. "That's actually what limits our population. That's their natural population control is their territoriality." Coyotes could be leaving the mainland because the Bay Area is becoming too crowded, Brett Furnas, a wildlife ecologist with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, told the Los Angeles Times. The species was driven out of the city but re-emerged about 25 years ago, he said, since when sightings have increased. While coyotes are adaptable and natural survivors, tour guide Moore is worried about Floyd's future and is pushing for human intervention. But finding him might be a challenge as coyotes are "masters of disguise", he says. And the coyote seems to be hiding in areas that are not accessible to the public. Moore and his colleagues have been trying to spot him on their walks, but instead have only found evidence he is leaving behind, like half-eaten birds. Some of his droppings have been collected and are undergoing DNA testing to get a better sense of Floyd's origins, he says. Whether Floyd will stay or go appears to be dependent on his behaviour and the tourists visiting the island. Project Coyote, a North American organisation focusing on science-based education around the animals and coexistence, is concerned that the barrage of visitors to Alcatraz could pose safety risks for both the animal and tourists. Most conflicts with coyotes stem from humans either intentionally or unintentionally feeding them, says Project Coyote founder Camilla Fox. "Coyotes are incredibly resourceful and able to coexist with coyotes even in the most densely populated urban environments," she tells the BBC. "So if not harassed, we believe this coyote could survive on the island - though it could be a lonely existence without a mate. "We hope whatever decision is made by the National Park Service, this coyote will have an opportunity to thrive and flourish." Kessler, the naturalist, believes this coyote might leave the island at some point because it's too small of a territory. "This is new to everybody. We're all going to be watching and seeing what this coyote does," she says. "I would assume, at some point, if he wants to go back, he'll swim."

**Excerpt**

One wrong move and it could all go wrong - the men clearing deadly undersea Russian mines The Black Sea is littered with deadly weapons. But no-one knows how many – or where they are. "When we approach it, we should be quiet, we should be slow – and we should be very accurate," says Vitalii, wiggling his hand in a snake-like motion, as he describes swimming through dark waters towards the explosive devices resting on the sea floor. The tall, softly spoken 31-year-old Ukrainian Navy diver is part of a team of 20 tasked with de-mining the parts of the Black Sea still under Ukraine's control. Mines are some of the most insidious and long-lasting legacies of war. They remain active, and deadly, for decades; the ones at sea present additional risks, as they can drift with currents and storms. The sea mines laid by Moscow at the start of the full-scale invasion – when Russian ships approached Odesa – are no different. And the danger is not theoretical: last summer, three swimmers were killed by mines off the Odesa coast. The commander of the navy's mine countermeasures group – a wry, sharp-eyed young man who goes by the callsign Fox – estimates the number of sea mines is in the thousands. But they are not the only danger lurking underwater. Missiles, artillery shells, bombs and land mines were washed downstream to the sea when the Kakhovka dam was blown up in 2022. These too could be triggered to explode at any minute. "If we speak about unexploded ordnance in general - missiles, artillery shells, aerial bombs - the total number will be many times higher" than several thousand, Fox says. His team's work is as perilous as it is vital. Despite the scale of the contamination, sea traffic has not come to a halt, and a significant number of merchant ships are still operating in the only maritime export corridor out of Ukraine. For Ukraine, the effort to clear the seabed is part of a broader attempt to keep the ports on the Black Sea usable, particularly by commercial ships that bring in a stream of much-needed revenue. Aided by a huge army, on the front line Moscow manages to just about hold the upper hand, but at sea, Ukraine has succeeded in evening out the playing field. Sitting in a café overlooking the Gulf of Odesa, navy spokesman Dmytro Pletenchuk gestures towards the expanse of sea beyond the window. "There is parity in the maritime domain at the moment," he says. "We find new ways to strike them; they look for ways to counter us. What works today will not work tomorrow - on both sides. They adopt our experience; we adopt theirs." Ukrainian ships cannot move further than the area surrounding Odesa due to Russian control of much of the coast. And Moscow has too seemingly reached the conclusion that moving ships out of many of its naval bases in the Black Sea is too big a risk, as they would be within reach of Ukrainian aerial strikes. In 2024, Russia withdrew its last remaining patrol ship from occupied Crimea. "While Russia may have an advantage on land and in the air, it does not at sea," he adds. "Here, Russia's main tactic - mass - does not work." "Naval warfare is technological. You cannot overwhelm an area with 'meat'," Pletenchuk says, using the term to refer to the sheer number of soldiers at Russia's disposal. The stalemate at sea has allowed Ukraine's sea exports to continue, and a so-called grain corridor to remain operational. Maritime exports account for over two-thirds of Ukrainian agricultural exports, which some reports say add up to roughly $9bn. It is an essential source of revenue for Ukraine. Although aerial attacks remain a regular reality, vessels continue to navigate in the area. "Judging by the fact that vessel traffic has not decreased, [commercial companies] are willing to take these risks," Pletenchuk says, pointing to two large ships cruising silently on the horizon. Now, keeping the shipping routes viable also depends on removing the threat beneath the surface. Mines and unexploded ordnance are still a passive tool Russia can use to disrupt maritime traffic, even without controlling the Black Sea itself. That is where divers like Vitalii come in. "We move carefully and extremely slowly so that the mine does not detonate," Vitalii says, describing the painstakingly slow process of demining. "One second you move, then you stay still for some time, and you repeat this until you reach the object. "Generally, it's up to 20 meters before [we reach] the object, so you can try to imagine how long it takes to approach it." But before the underwater de-mining mission can even begin, Vitalii's group needs to identify the object, as missiles and a wealth of World War Two unexploded bombs sit on the seabed alongside Russian sea mines. Commander Fox explains that mines generally fall into two categories: contact mines, which detonate when struck, and influence mines, which explode when sensors detect changes in sound, pressure or magnetism. "Usually, the acoustic sensor is on duty," he says. "If it hears noise, it can activate another sensor." Large commercial ships are particularly vulnerable to magnetic mines, which respond to changes in the magnetic field. "The mine lies on the bottom and explodes when a big vessel approaches," says Fox, mimicking two magnets snapping together. "Until that moment, it just waits." Two divers approach each device in total silence, using closed-circuit rebreathers that produce no bubbles. Once a mine is identified, the actual detonation often takes place the following day. The sensors, Vitalii says, are first disabled using a series of controlled explosions with the first done from about 10 meters away. Only then can divers approach the device itself. The final decision - whether to move the mine or destroy it in place - is taken by headquarters. This surgical operation takes two days, several boats, and the work of 20 people - all operating under the constant threat of Russian missiles and drones, both aerial and seaborne, which could easily trigger the mines. During air strikes, GPS signals are scrambled, making sonar readings imprecise. De-mining the sea is not impossible, but doing so in the middle of active combat ramps up the risk considerably. "Everything can go wrong", Fox says. Vitalii nods. Once, he recalls, as he was approaching a mine using sonar, another object appeared on his screen, moving slowly through the darkness. His first thought was that it could be a Russian underwater drone, and that the mine would detonate. Then, he turned and saw four or five dolphins swimming past. "Beautiful, yes," he says, his eyes widening. "But not at that moment." According to Pletenchuk, in 2025 the de-mining group neutralised more than 50 mines - a fraction of the total. In 2023 the British Navy gifted Ukraine two mine-hunting vessels that could speed the work up – but because large ships in the Black Sea are an easy target, they are still stationed in the UK and won't be deployed until a ceasefire has been agreed. Two years after the vessels were handed over, that possibility still seems remote. In the current conditions, Vitalii says, clearing the seabed will take dozens of years. Despite the risks, revenue from maritime exports will only grow more essential for Ukraine the longer the war continues. And so divers like Vitalii will keep going back into the water - moving one second at a time, then waiting three more.

**Excerpt**

This tiny Australian town is up for sale - but the locals don't want to leave Tucked away in the rugged Victorian bushland lies the tiny outpost of Licola, population: five. Consisting of a couple of weatherboard buildings, a general store, a caravan park and a petrol station grouped around a modest main street, Licola is one of Australia's smallest towns. And if you have a spare couple of million dollars, you can buy it. The entire village - a three-hour drive from the city of Melbourne - is now up for grabs, much to the shock and ire of tight-knit locals. Privately owned by a local community club, Licola has long been a guaranteed pit stop for fuel, food and rest for travellers on their way to the Alpine National Park. It also has a 50-year legacy of hosting outreach programmes for young people. But the local branch of the Lions Club says it can't afford to run the town anymore, and late last year quietly listed it for sale online. The sale has raised alarm bells for Licola's few passionate residents, locals in surrounding areas and even other Lions Clubs state members, who say they weren't fairly consulted and now hold grave fears for the future of the town. 'A home away from home' Nestled beside the banks of the mighty Macalister River in Victoria's high country, Licola was originally a timber mill, built in the 1950s with a few buildings for those working there. After it closed in 1968, the Lions Club acquired the whole site and turned it into a camp where disadvantaged young people and children, and groups with special needs, could stay during school holidays. Just around the corner from the camp, they also snapped up land which now hosts Licola's General Store and Caravan Park. Today, Leanne O'Donnell - who runs the General Store - and her family are the only full-time residents of the town. She lives there with one of her children, along with her best friend and her two kids. "It's just an amazing place," O'Donnell tells the BBC. "When I first moved here, people would come into my store and say, 'You're not going to make a million dollars in Licola.' And I'd say, 'Who said I'm here to make a million dollars?'." O'Donnell purchased the business in 2022 but doesn't own the buildings, signing a lease she says she was led to believe would be extended to a 15-year term. From day one, O'Donnell wanted Licola to be "a home away from home" for people. Nearly every person who visits, works or passes through Licola has O'Donnell's number – even truck drivers and the Country Fire Authority. "I'm the main point of contact for them, regardless of whether it's three in the afternoon or two in the morning," she said. O'Donnell is extremely passionate about the town and serving its surrounding community - but she now faces eviction. "I absolutely love this town... if it gets into the hands of a developer and turns into something that it's not, it [will] just break my heart." O'Donnell first learned Licola was headed for the market in January 2025, from the Lions Village Licola board, which is appointed to manage the town on behalf of the charity. "They told me that their business had been running at a loss for the last five or six years and I asked them, 'so how can I help you?'," O'Donnell says. "They turned around and said, unless you get a couple of million dollars, there's nothing much you can do." But O'Donnell persisted, offering to run fundraisers for the village and telling the board that the broader community will want to help. The board wouldn't budge, O'Donnell says. Eventually she said: "So you're going to buy my business?" "And they said, no, we're just going to take your business because we own the land and we own the buildings," she says. "And you just need to pack up and leave. I couldn't get it in my head and understand it at the time." After seeking legal advice, O'Donnell quickly realised that because she was signed to a lease, the board could do just that. "In the real world, I could take my business and put it in another building... that's not a problem at all anywhere else except for Licola." Here, there is nowhere else to go. By December, O'Donnell found a real estate listing online for the sale of the town, with an asking price of between A$6m (£3m, $4.3m) and $10m. Petitions and threats The sale has been met with intense backlash online from locals in the surrounding areas. Many are upset over the way O'Donnell has been treated and are concerned the beloved town could die out or be commercialised. One user's comment on the Licola Caravan Park & General Store official Facebook page says: "People rely on the store in town, and closing in the middle of peak season is stupidity at its best." Another person says selling the town "impacts MANY Victorians that come to Licola and have camped [there] for years". "There are some great past leaders of Lions and leaders of the Licola village and camp whom I know are turning in their graves," another comment says. Other Victorian Lions members wrote to the Lions Village Licola Board, accusing it of acting without due process and consultation with the broader Lions Club members it is supposed to represent. An online petition to save the store, "renew the lease and let Leanne stay", has more than 8,000 signatures. As outrage grew, the Lions Village Licola board said its staff were receiving threats and it was considering withdrawing them from the town. In a statement to the BBC, a spokesperson said the sale was prompted by a review into the town's operations, which was provided to all Lions in Victoria. After the review, the board decided it was no longer sustainable for the Lions Club to own the village, listing rising costs and insurance prices, aging accommodation, and a decline in school and camp attendance as the main reasons. "The decision to sell was not made lightly," the statement said. Chairman Denis Carruthers has said the board has a responsibility to protect the mission of the Lions Village - supporting disadvantaged youth - not just the physical space. "The Lions District Governors have been briefed and are supportive," he told the BBC. The board also said in their statement that O'Donnell's lease "was not renewed in order to consolidate revenue during a period of financial stress". O'Donnell has been told she has to vacate the premises by 31 January this year. All proceeds of the sale of the Licola properties and future business profits will be reinvested into a new foundation, which will continue to pay for children to attend camps run professionally across Victoria, it said. Whether future camps will continue to run in Licola is unknown at this stage, Carruthers added, with a planned camp for January cancelled due to low numbers. It remains unclear who the new owners will be – or what they will want to do with the town. But, he said, there is "considerable interest in the property".
