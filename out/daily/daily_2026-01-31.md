Federal judge denies request to block ICE surge in Minnesota A federal judge on Saturday denied a state government request to block the Trump administration's deployment of thousands of federal immigration agents in Minneapolis, Minnesota. In a ruling, District Court Judge Katherine Menendez said the immigration enforcement operation "has had, and will likely continue to have, profound and even heartbreaking, consequences on the State of Minnesota". But, she said, state officials had not proved that the Trump administration's surge of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in Minneapolis was unlawful. The ruling comes as thousands nationwide have taken to the streets to protest the fatal shootings of two US citizens by federal agents. Demonstrators are expected to gather on Saturday afternoon in Minneapolis, after protests were also held in cities across the US on Friday, including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Washington DC. Organisers called on Americans to stay home from work and school. The deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti have caused public outcry across the country, and led to criticism from lawmakers in both parties. Earlier on Friday, the US Justice Department opened a civil rights investigation into Pretti's death. The 37-year-old nurse was the second Minneapolis resident shot and killed by federal immigration officials since their arrival in the state. Good, the first, was killed by an ICE agent on 7 January. In her ruling on Saturday, Judge Menendez said there was "evidence that ICE and CBP agents have engaged in racial profiling, excessive use of force, and other harmful actions". But, she said, state officials "have provided no metric by which to determine when lawful law enforcement becomes unlawful commandeering". State and local officials had argued in their lawsuit that Trump's deployment of 3,000 immigration agents despite objections violated the state's sovereignty. Organisers of nationwide protests on Friday, called the National Shutdown, urged "no work. No school. No shopping" on 30 January to send the message to "stop funding ICE". The action was organised over the deaths of Pretti and Good, as well as others killed by ICE, including Silverio Villegas-Gonzales, who was shot by an ICE agent in September 2025, according to the group's website. Protesters formed the letters "SOS" on top of a frozen lake in southern Minneapolis, while one group marched through the streets carrying a large-scale replica of the preamble to the US constitution. Singer Bruce Springsteen also performed a newly released song in honour of Pretti and Good entitled Streets of Minneapolis at a concert in the city. On Thursday, border tsar Tom Homan suggested the Trump administration could "draw down" federal forces in the state if local officials co-operate. "We are not surrendering our mission at all. We're just doing it smarter," he said during a news conference. Homan began leading on-the-ground efforts in Minneapolis after it was announced Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino would be leaving the area. US President Donald Trump said on Thursday evening: "We will keep our country safe, we'll do whatever we can to keep our country safe." About 3,000 federal agents were sent to Minnneapolis at Trump's directive. The DHS has said it was arresting the "worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens" in an effort to restore public safety in Minnesota, but critics argue migrants with clean records and US citizens are being caught up in the campaign. Dubbed Operation Metro Surge, the immigration enforcement initiative has sparked outcry from residents in Minneapolis, St Paul and other cities in the state. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey have called on federal agents to withdraw from Minneapolis.

Five killed in gas explosions in Iran, officials say Five people have been killed in two separate explosions in Iran which local officials and state media say were caused by gas leaks. One person was killed and 14 injured in a blast at a residential building in the southern city of Bandar Abbas on the Gulf coast, a local official told Iran's semi-official Mehr news agency. Another explosion killed four people in the south-western city of Ahvaz, the state-run Tehran Times reported. It comes as tensions persist in the region after a build-up of US forces in the Gulf and pressure that Tehran strike a deal on its nuclear programme from President Donald Trump - who said on Saturday that Iran was "talking to" Washington. In the port city of Bandar Abbas, state TV said the explosion had ripped though an eight-floor building, "destroying two floors, several vehicles, and shops" in the Moallem Boulevard area. The local fire department chief Mohammad Amin Liaqat said a preliminary assessment showed it had been caused by a gas leak and "build-up". "My colleagues will give more details in the next few hours," he said in a video published by Mehr. Mehrdad Hassanzadeh, a regional official, told the news agency that the injured had been taken to hospital. Semi-official news agency Tasnim denied social media reports that a Revolutionary Guards Corps navy commander had been targeted in the blast. Elsewhere, Tehran Times reported a second explosion at a residential building in the Kianshahr neighbourhood of Ahvaz, near the border with Iraq. It reported that emergency officials had rescued a child trapped beneath debris and transferred him for medical treatment. Meanwhile on Saturday, Trump said Iran was "talking to us" as tensions continue between the two countries, without providing details. "They are negotiating,'' he told Fox News, while adding that Washington could not share its plans with its allies in the Gulf. "We'll see if we can do something, otherwise we'll see what happens... we have a big fleet heading out there." Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian said conflict would not be in the interest of either country nor the broader region. "The Islamic Republic of Iran has never sought and in no way seeks war," he said during a call with his Egyptian counterpart Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, news agency AFP reported citing a statement from Iran's presidency. Separately, the head of the country's Supreme National Security Council Ali Larijani met the Qatari prime minister in Tehran on Saturday and "reviewed ongoing efforts to de-escalate tensions in the region", Qatar's foreign ministry said. Larijani, whom the Kremlin said had also met Russia's President Putin for talks on Friday, wrote on X: "Contrary to the hype of the contrived media war, structural arrangements for negotiations are progressing." Iran's foreign minister has said Tehran is open to talks with the US provided they are based on trust and respect but cautioned that its missile defence system would "never" be the subject of negotiation. Trump told Tehran on Wednesday that time was "running out" for it to reach a deal on its nuclear programme - which Iran insists is peaceful - and later said they must also "stop killing protesters" to avoid military action. It came after he had promised to intervene to help those involved in a brutal crackdown on protests in the country earlier this month, although he later said he had heard on good authority that the execution of demonstrators had stopped. The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency says it has confirmed the killing of more than 6,300 people since the unrest began in late December, and is investigating another 17,000 reported deaths.

**Excerpt**

Musk's SpaceX applies to launch 1m satellites into orbit Elon Musk's SpaceX has applied to launch one million satellites into Earth's orbit to power artificial intelligence (AI). The application claims "orbital data centres" are the most cost and energy-efficient way to meet the growing demand for AI computing power. Traditionally, such centres are large warehouses full of powerful computers which process and store data. Musk's aerospace firm claims processing needs due to the expanding use of AI are already outpacing "terrestrial capabilities". It would increase the number of SpaceX satellites in orbit drastically. Its existing Starlink network of nearly 10,000 satellites has already been accused of creating congestion in space, which Musk denies. The new network could comprise up to one million solar-powered satellites, according to the application filed on Friday with the Federal Communications Commission - which does not specify a timeline for the plan. SpaceX claims the system would deliver the computer capacity required to serve "billions of users globally". It also says it would be the first step towards "becoming a Kardashev II-level civilisation - one that can harness the Sun's full power", referencing a scale of hypothetical alien societies proposed by an astronomer in the 1960s. Musk wrote on his social media site X: "The satellites will actually be so far apart that it will be hard to see from one to another. Space is so vast as to be beyond comprehension." Like the Starlink satellites, which provide high-speed internet, they would operate in low-Earth orbit at altitudes from 500-2,000km (310-1,242 miles). SpaceX claims "orbital data centres" - a concept also being explored by other firms - would be a greener alternative to traditional centres, which require enormous amounts of power and water for cooling. An expert previously told the BBC that launching hardware into orbit remains expensive and that the infrastructure to protect, cool and power them can be complex - while a growing quantity of space debris puts the physical hardware at risk. Separately, another cautioned that the growing number of low-orbit craft increases the possibility of crashes between objects - which could damage machines or send materials falling back to earth. Meanwhile, astronomers complained in 2024 that radio waves from the Starlink network were "blinding" their telescopes and hindering their research. Musk has previously rejected claims that his satellites were taking up too much room and crowding out competitors.

### 4. [Israel eyes regime change in Iran - and is counting on Trump to make it happen](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c78egvpkm77o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

Israel eyes regime change in Iran - and is counting on Trump to make it happen Amid the din of global speculation over US military build-up in the Middle East, Israel's leaders have remained unusually silent. Aside from some remarks in support of Iran's anti-government protests this month, Israel's prime minister has had little to say publicly about his superpower ally taking on his biggest enemy. His government has remained equally silent. "It shows you the importance Netanyahu puts on this moment," said Danny Citrinowicz, who served for 25 years in Israel's Defence Intelligence, and is now senior Iran researcher at Israel's Institute for National Security Studies. "For Netanyahu, being in this position where the US has so many forces in the Gulf, being so close to Trump attacking Iran, this is - for him - a golden moment in time that he cannot forgo." Asaf Cohen, a former deputy director of Israel's signals intelligence unit, says there's strategy in Israel's silence too. "The [Israeli] leadership believes we should allow the Americans to lead the way this time, because they are stronger, have more capabilities, and have much more legitimacy in the world." Benjamin Netanyahu has long seen Iran as the key threat facing Israel, and the biggest source of instability in the Middle East. His public silence does not signal a lack of private discussion with his key US ally. This week, Israel's military intelligence chief, Shlomi Binder, met US intelligence agencies in Washington. According to Israeli media, the discussion focused on possible targets in Iran. Citrinowicz believes Netanyahu is privately pushing the US towards maximalist strikes aimed at regime change in Iran, and that when Netanyahu reportedly urged Trump to hold back earlier this month, he says, it was because he viewed the planned US attack as "too small". Netanyahu has previously urged Iranians to "stand up" to their regime, in an interview with Fox News last year. US president Donald Trump is currently considering a range of actions against Iran – they are reported to include both limited symbolic strikes and full-blown regime change. In public, he has alternated military threats with the offer of fresh negotiations. While many US allies are warning that trying to unseat Iran's leadership carries huge risks for the region, many in Israel see potential benefits for their security. By changing the regime in Tehran, Israel would hope to end the threat from Iran's ballistic missiles, and the possibility that it would one day acquire nuclear weapons too. It would also further weaken Iran's proxy militia around the region, including Hezbollah, which still has up to 25,000 missiles and rockets across the border in Lebanon according to Israel's Alma research institute. In contrast, some Israeli lawmakers believe a limited strike, or even a new deal with Iran, could carry bigger risks for Israel's security by leaving the regime in place. "When you deal with total evil, you don't act limited," said Moshe Tur-Paz, a member of the Yesh Atid opposition party who sits on the Defence Committee of Israel's parliament. "There's a consensus that Israel should act much stronger and so should the Western world. When it comes to our worst enemies like Iran, there are no big differences. We all understand the threat." Another round of conflict that left the regime intact would not be worth the price paid in Iran's retaliation, many say. During the 12-day war last year, when Israel and the US attacked Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile sites, Iran fired back hundreds of ballistic missiles at Israeli towns and cities. Some evaded Israel's vaunted air-defences, slamming into apartment blocks in Tel Aviv and killing at least 28 people. The Israeli military had prepared for many more casualties, but Tehran's heightened sense of vulnerability now could mean a more intense response. And analysts have suggested that Iran learned from that conflict, adapting its tactics as the war progressed. Half a year on, Iran is rebuilding its missile stocks. This week, a senior adviser to Iran's Supreme Leader warned on social media that Tel Aviv would be hit with an "immediate and unprecedented" response in the event of any US attack. "Netanyahu is afraid Israel will [again] go through the pain of an attack without a change of regime," said Citrinowicz. "He came to the conclusion that to stop the missiles being built, you have to have regime change, but regime change can happen only with the US." And this moment of intense vulnerablity for the Iranian regime – its military defences diminished after the 12-day war, its regional proxy forces weakened, and after widespread protests against its rule at home – also represents an opportunity, says Cohen. "Iran is at its weakest now - this is an opportunity that may not come again," said Cohen. "There are a lot of people who believe this is the time - it's now or never." In Tel Aviv, residents still living with the wreckage from Iranian missile strikes last June are speculating about another conflict. "I hope [our leaders] don't miss this opportunity," said Neria, a young man in his early 20s. "If it's through attack or through other means, I don't know, but certainly we should leverage the situation to switch regimes. It won't be the first time we'll deal with the bombs - it's not nice, but if it's going to help us in the longer term to feel safer here then we will have to go through it". Shani, a young woman nearby, said she had mixed feelings. "I know the Iranian people - many of them - want the US to help. I just hope that everyone will stay safe," she said. "Politicians need to think about the people. Actions have consequences." Israeli polls repeatedly show a strong majority of Jewish residents support military action against Iran - including after the 12-day war last year. But the risks of regime change remain. With no obvious cracks in the military and clerical alliance around Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and a splintered opposition movement in the country, it's not clear who would take over control of Iran if the government fell. A younger successor from the same ruling elite would not necessarily be more flexible in their response to Israel, and the chaos of a civil war would not only be deeply destabilising for Iranians, but for the region as a whole. And several defence insiders have pointed out that regimes are not usually toppled by air-strikes alone. Israel's prime minister, facing elections this year, has worked hard since the Hamas attacks to try and restore his broken image as Israel's "Mr Security". Regime change in Iran – or Khamanei's assassination - would be a political prize, but also a risk. "It is a gamble, but it's a calculated one," says Citrinowicz. "Netanyahu couldn't care less what happens the day after Khamenei. He wants to show, together with Trump, that he destroyed the Iranian regime. It's a risk he's willing to take if he knows the Americans will go all the way. The problem is Trump." Both the US and Iran have said they are open to negotiations, but Trump has conditioned talks on ending Iran's uranium enrichment along with its support for proxies in the region, and limits on its ballistic missiles – all seen as red lines for the regime. Israel's leadership is firmly against a deal, and Israeli analysts are divided over whether one is even achievable. Cohen said he thought both Washington and Tehran wanted an agreement, but that if one wasn't reached soon the US would strike. "Iran's Supreme Leader and Trump have something in common. There aren't really any red lines. During the negotiations in 2013, we used to called them 'pink lines', because they changed," said Cohen. "We always talk about Iran as evil, but they are very rational," he said. "I think they understand that in order to change the situation, they need to do something that hasn't been done until now." "Yes, the ability to show compromise is there, they're not North Korea, but this regime has its red lines," countered Citrinowicz, warning that a war would be hard to contain "because Iranians will think it's a war for their survival". There are signs that Trump may be limiting his conditions for negotiations and focusing on Iran's nuclear programme. If the bar is lowered enough for Tehran to begin talks, much of the region will breathe a sigh of relief - and many in Israel will hold their breath. Cohen says there are ways of constructing compromises on issues such as enrichment that could temporarily prevent any new activity in practice while allowing Iran to avoid an explicit ban. "The essential difference between us and the Iranians is we like quick results, and the Iranians have great patience," he said. "They say: 'we've been here 2000 years, if we need another 30 years to get a nuclear weapon, it's ok'."

**Excerpt**

US government partially shuts down despite last minute funding deal The US federal government has partially shutdown despite a last-ditch funding deal approved by the Senate. The funding lapse began at midnight US eastern time (05:00 GMT) on Saturday, hours after senators agreed to fund most agencies until September. The bill includes just two weeks' funding for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees immigration enforcement, instead of shutting it down entirely. The bill has yet to be approved by the House of Representatives, which is out of session. US President Donald Trump struck the deal with Democrats after they refused to give more funding for immigration enforcement following the fatal shooting of two US citizens in Minneapolis by federal agents. It is the second such government shutdown in the past year and comes just 11 weeks after the end of the previous funding impasse that lasted 43 days, the longest in US history. That shutdown in 2025, which spanned 1 October to 14 November, had widespread impacts on essential government services including air travel and left hundreds of thousands of federal workers without pay for weeks. This shutdown, however, is unlikely to be that long or widespread as the House of Representatives is set to be back in session on Monday. The White House, though, has directed several agencies, including the departments of transportation, education and defence to execute shutdown plans. "Employees should report to work for their next regularly scheduled tour of duty to undertake orderly shutdown activities," a White House memo to agencies said. "It is our hope that this lapse will be short." Trump has urged Republicans, who hold the majority of seats in the US House, to vote for the deal. Lawmakers plan to use the fortnight in which the DHS will continue to be funded to negotiate a deal. Democrats want that deal to include new policies for immigration enforcement agents. "We need to rein in ICE and end the violence," Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. "That means ending roving patrols. It means requiring rules, oversight, and judicial warrants... Masks need to come off, cameras need to stay on, and officers need visible identification. No secret police." Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have sharply criticised tactics used by immigration agents in the wake of the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis last weekend. Pretti, an intensive care nurse, was shot by a US Border Patrol agent after an altercation in which several agents tried to restrain him. On Friday, the Justice Department launched a civil rights investigation into the shooting.

**Excerpt**

What we learned - and didn't - from the Melania documentary From televised cabinet meetings to late night Truth Social posts, US President Donald Trump has rarely stepped out of the spotlight since he resumed office in January. But more often than not, he's done it without his wife. So where is Melania? A new documentary co-produced by the first lady herself aims to answer that question. Melania: 20 Days to History promises viewers an intimate glimpse into Melania Trump's life in the days leading up to her husband's January 2025 inauguration. The film opened in cinemas across the US on Friday amid controversy. It has received significant attention from administration critics and watchdogs, who have criticised the project's funding and dismissed the timing of its release as insensitive as mass protests swell over two fatal shootings by federal agents in Minneapolis. Politics aside, those seeking answers about how Trump spends her time might find the film unsatisfying - much of it shows her in transit, at public events or drifting between meetings to review fabric samples and dinnerware. Still, small interactions with her closest friends offer some glimpses at how the famously enigmatic first lady is approaching her husband's second term. "Everyone wants to know, so here it is," she says in an opening voiceover. Here's what we've learned from watching the film - and what we didn't. Fleeting off-script moments Early on, Trump is clear about her intent: "I want to show the American people my journey from private citizen to first lady." The film touches briefly on the controversy around its creation, in a meta moment that shows Trump's staff fielding an inquiry from a journalist about its commission. It is a co-production from Trump herself and director Brett Ratner, along with other partners, and distribution by Amazon MGM Studios. The film is Ratner's first project since he was accused of sexual misconduct at the height of the #MeToo movement in 2017. Ratner has denied the allegations. Much of the film takes place at Trump Tower in New York, at the president's Florida residence at Mar-a-Lago or en route between the two. We see little of either property, just the spaces in which Trump meets her trusted staff of stylists, event planners and interior decorators. At several points, Ratner intervenes to prod Trump into sharing more about herself. What kind of music does she like? Michael Jackson is her favourite, she reveals during a car ride to the airport - especially "Billie Jean", which plays twice during the film. The pair listen to the song and she briefly sings along. "Are we doing Carpool Karaoke with Melania?" Ratner excitedly asks. Her most personal struggle Trump is most candid about her mother's death, describing the grief as overwhelming. Amalija Knavs died in January 2024. She first opens up to an interior decorator when discussing plans for the Trump family to move into the White House. Her grief appears to swell when she attends the funeral of former President Jimmy Carter in Washington DC on 9 January 2025, the anniversary of her mother's death. She describes sitting in the Washington National Cathedral, present for Carter but "my beloved mother will be on my mind". Knavs, she says, was the "richest thread of my life". Donald Trump remarks to the camera that his wife had a "hard time" with her mother's death. After the funeral, Melania Trump proceeds directly from one cathedral to another, St Patrick's Cathedral in Manhattan, to light a candle in her mother's honour. Inside her small inner circle Her husband appears sparingly, emerging at key events and in a handful of private moments to praise her. Perhaps her warmest relationships are seen with her long-time stylist, Hervé Pierre, and France's First Lady Brigitte Macron. "I go everywhere with you, we are connected on many subjects," Macron tells her. While Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron have navigated a rocky relationship, the two first ladies praised each other in a video call discussing their mutual concern with youth anxiety and social media use. In contrast, her meetings with Pierre, who designed many of her looks for the inauguration, focus on finer details - an eighth of a inch on a collar or the cut of a lapel. When asked about her friendship with Pierre, she says the two have worked together for years because they have "great energy and vision" together. Pierre tells the camera that he feels they speak the same language - the language of details and design, owing to Trump's history as a model and her strong opinions on how her clothes fit. What we don't see is the wider Trump family, or its dynamics. The Trump children only appear in the crowd at his swearing-in. Though Melania Trump speaks warmly of her son Barron, he appears to avoid the camera - abruptly walking away when the family enters the White House together. "It is very important that he lives the life he wants to live," she says. Complicated role of first lady Throughout the film, Trump hints at discomfort with her new role, at times seeming to mourn the loss of her privacy and freedom to the rigid and public obligations of being first lady. The role of first lady is "more structured" and comes with "fewer quiet moments", she says, and she feels she must stay "mentally strong". The documentary hints at the tumult of the 2024 presidential election and the toll of Donald Trump's campaign. But Melania Trump largely avoids offering her own perspective. She directs much of the attention back to Donald Trump, echoing her husband's public statements that he has endured grave injustice. "Nobody has endured what he has for the last few years," she says in a voice over. "Here he is, I'm so very proud." She describes her job as first lady as one of juggling obligations. "You have your schedule, the White House schedule, the president's schedule," she says. "You need to be a mother, wife, daughter, friend." Watching the news, she expresses genuine sadness at reports of a tragedy or children with high screen time, but holds off on offering opinions or specific policy goals as first lady. She views footage of the Palisades fire burning in Los Angeles, lamenting the cost to "the families". The scene cuts to her walking into a meeting with Aviva Siegel, an Israeli woman who was taken hostage in the Hamas-led attack on Israel on 7 October 2023. Her husband Keith was still in captivity at the time of filming, but was later released in Feburary 2025. Trump hugs Siegel as she cries. "I will pray that he doesn't suffer," she says, noting that her husband will be in office in a few days' time and could help. "I will always use my influence and power to fight for those in need," she says. Reactions divided by politics Documentaries have become a key part of the celebrity PR toolkit in the last decade. Where social media can be unpredictable, self-produced documentaries by the likes of Taylor Swift, Demi Lovato and Selena Gomez offer a revenue stream, fan service and a unique degree of image control, all with the promise of intimacy. At a Friday afternoon showing at a cinema outside of Washington DC attended by the BBC, the audience was filled with a mostly older crowd dressed in American flag attire, who cheered and clapped throughout the film. This is part of why Trump may have chosen this kind of project, says Katherine Jellison, a women's studies professor and expert in first ladies at Ohio University. "As she said in her own memoir, she resents that others defined her the first time around," Jellison told the BBC. But unlike the glossy productions before it, the film's ties to the Trump administration - and more importantly, its politics - have coloured perceptions even before its release. A private screening at the White House attended by conservative influencer Erika Kirk and Apple CEO Tim Cook came hours after federal agents shot and killed Alex Pretti in Minneapolis. Critics of the Trump administration labelled the opulent event as insensitive and out of touch. In Los Angeles, protesters vandalised public advertisements promoting the film. On review websites, they posted scathing ratings before the film was even released - a practice known as review-bombing. The film's funding by Amazon has also drawn criticism, at a time when several billionaires and business leaders, including the company's founder Jeff Bezos, have sought to strengthen their ties to the White House. Amazon spent $35m (£25m) on marketing, on top of around $40m for the rights to the film, according to media reports. Industry veterans have described it as an uncommonly expensive documentary. "How can it not be equated with currying favour or an outright bribe? How can that not be the case?" a former Amazon employee, who helped the company start its film division, told the New York Times. But in the film itself, Melania Trump seems to largely remove herself from the political concerns of the White House, preferring to focus on the fine details of the dinners and dresses to come. In one moment, Donald Trump calls to encourage her to watch a recent appearance of his. She declines, drawing chuckles in the cinema. "I will see it on the news," she tells him. Her final take on her position, offered towards the end of the film, describes the role as an exercise in personal growth: "As first lady, the real nobility is becoming stronger than the person I was yesterday."
