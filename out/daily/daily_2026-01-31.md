Takeaways from the millions of newly released Epstein files Millions of new files relating to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein have been released by the US Department of Justice, the largest number of documents shared by the government since a law mandated their release last year. Three million pages, 180,000 images and 2,000 videos were posted publicly on Friday. The release came six weeks after the department missed a legal deadline signed into law by President Donald Trump that mandated all Epstein-related documents be shared with the public. "Today's release marks the end of a very comprehensive document identification and review process to ensure transparency to the American people and compliance," Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said. The files include details about Jeffrey Epstein's time in prison - including a psychological report - and his death while incarcerated, along with investigative records on Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's associate who was convicted of helping him traffic underaged girls. They also include emails between Epstein and high-profile figures. Many of the emails and documents go back more than a decade, showcasing Epstein's relationships amid his legal troubles. He was convicted in 2008 in Florida for soliciting sex from a 14-year-old girl after coming to a controversial plea agreement with prosecutors. He died in August 2019 while in jail on charges in a sprawling sex trafficking case. Epstein invited 'The Duke' to meet Russian woman The documents also reveal the disgraced financier's close association with Britain's elite. They include emails between Epstein and a person named "The Duke" - believed to be Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor - discussing having dinner at Buckingham Palace, where there is "lots of privacy". Another message from Epstein includes an offer to introduce "The Duke" to a 26-year-old Russian woman. The emails are signed "A", with a signature that appears to read "HRH Duke of York KG". They were exchanged in August 2010, two years after Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting a minor. The emails do not indicate any wrongdoing. The BBC has contacted Andrew, formerly known as the Duke of York, for a response. Mountbatten-Windsor has faced years of scrutiny over his past friendship with Epstein. He has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. Some emails in the latest release appear to be between Epstein and Sarah Ferguson, Andrew's ex-wife. One email dated April 4th 2009, was signed "Love, Sarah, The red Head.!!" It says that she was going to be in Palm Beach and wanted to get tea. The email goes on to discuss ides for Ferguson's company, Mother's Army. The former Duchess of York refers to Epstein as "My dear spectacular and special friend Jeffrey". She calls him a "legend" and says "I am so proud of you". The financier was still under house arrest for his 2008 conviction when the email exchange was sent. Epstein sent money to Mandelson's husband Other emails show Epstein sent £10,000 ($13,692 USD) to Lord Peter Mandelson's husband Reinaldo Avila da Silva in 2009. In an email to Epstein, da Silva sets out the costs of an osteopathy course, provides his bank details and thanks the financier for "anything you can help me with". Epstein replies a few hours later saying he would wire the loan amount and da Silva, who married Mandelson in 2023, replies with a thank you the following day. In another batch of emails, Lord Mandelson asks to stay at one of Epstein's properties. The emails are from 16 June 2009, when Epstein was serving a prison sentence for soliciting prostitution from someone under the age of 18. For much of his sentence, Epstein was allowed to work from his office during the day and returned to jail each night. In December 2024, Lord Mandelson was appointed as the UK's ambassador to the US but was sacked less than a year later, when it emerged he had sent supportive messages to Epstein following the conviction. Mandelson has repeatedly said he regrets his past friendship with Epstein, which has long been public knowledge. He has said he never saw any wrongdoing while with Epstein and "fell for his lies". Trump is mentioned hundreds of times US President Donald Trump is mentioned hundreds of times in the newly-released files. Trump had a friendship with Epstein but he says they soured many years ago and has denied any knowledge of his sex crimes. Among the new documents is a list compiled by the FBI last year of allegations made against Trump by callers to its national Threat Operation Center tip line. Many of these appear to be based on unverified tips received by the agency, and were made without supporting evidence. The list includes numerous allegations of sexual abuse made against Trump, Epstein and other high-profile figures. Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein and has not been accused of any crimes by Epstein's victims. When asked about the latest allegations, both the White House and justice department pointed to a line in a news release accompanying the new batch of files. "Some of the documents contain untrue and sensationalist claims against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election," the US Justice Department said. "To be clear, the claims are unfounded and false, and if they have a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponised against President Trump already." Elon Musk asked Epstein when the 'wildest party' on his island will be The documents also include email correspondence between tech billionaire Elon Musk and Epstein. Musk, who has not been accused of any wrongdoing in the case, has previously said that Epstein had invited him to his island but he had declined. The new emails show Musk had discussed traveling there on more than one occasion - including a 2012 trip where he asked Epstein "What day/night will be the wildest party on your island?" The emails in November 2012 show Epstein asked how many people Musk would need transported on a helicopter to the island and he says just his wife at the time, Talulah Riley. An email from Musk to Epstein on Christmas in 2012 includes Musk inquiring whether the financer has any parties planned because he needs to "let loose". "I've been working to the edge of sanity this year and so, once my kids head home after Christmas, I really want to hit the party scene in St Barts or elsewhere and let loose," he writes, adding that a "peaceful island experience" is the opposite of what he's wanting. In another batch of emails from the end of 2013, Musk and Epstein discuss a visit to the financer's island and are working on logistics and dates. There is no evidence that Musk ever did end up taking a trip to Epstein's island. The BBC has contacted representatives for Musk at his companies about the new emails. Bill Gates dismisses lurid claims by Epstein as 'absurd and false' A spokesperson for Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has responded to lurid allegations contained in the latest Epstein files – including that he caught a sexually-transmitted disease – calling them "absolutely absurd and completely false". Two emails from July 18, 2013 appear to have been drafted by Epstein but it is unclear if they were ever sent to Gates. Both are sent from Epstein's email account and back to the same account. No email account associated with Gates is visible and both emails are unsigned. One email is written as a resignation letter from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and complains about having had to procure medicine for Gates "in order to deal with the consequences of sex with Russian girls". The other, which begins "dear Bill", complains about Gates having ended a friendship and makes more claims about Gates having tried to cover up a sexually transmitted infection, including from his then wife, Melinda. A spokesperson for Gates told the BBC: "These claims – from a proven, disgruntled liar – are absolutely absurd and completely false." They added: "The only thing these documents demonstrate is Epstein's frustration that he did not have an ongoing relationship with Gates and the lengths he would go to entrap and defame." Have all the Epstein files now been released? It is uncertain if this is end of the road for the Epstein documents release saga. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said today's drop "marks the end of a very comprehensive document identification and review process" signalling that for the Justice Department, it's job over. However, Democrats continue to argue that the department has withheld too many documents – possibly around two and a half million – without proper justification. Democratic Congressman Roh Khanna, who spearheaded the Epstein Files Transparency Act alongside Republican Congressman Thomas Massie, said he's wary. "The DOJ said it identified over 6 million potentially responsive pages but is releasing only about 3.5 million after review and redactions," said Democratic Congressman Roh Khanna, who spearheaded the Epstein Files Transparency Act alongside Republican Congressman Thomas Massie "This raises questions as to why the rest are being withheld. I will be reviewing closely to see if they release what I've been pushing for." The Department of Justice had been under heavy scrutiny after missing the 19 December deadline to release all files as mandated in the Epstein Files Transparency Act which, passed Congress and was signed into law in November. Many of the documents released on Friday include heavy redactions. The law mandates that redactions can only be made to protect victims or information currently under investigation. It also mandates a summary of the redactions made and the legal basis for them. Blanche said the redactions aimed to protect victims and the department had hundreds of employees combing through the documents for more than two months to ensure they were released quickly. But still, whether this saga is over remains to be seen. Many - including within Trump's base - have long believed there was a conspiracy to protect the rich and powerful who were connected to Epstein. Blanche acknowledged the release of these documents would not satisfy that need for more information. He said the files don't contain the names of specific men who abused women and that if the department had those names, the men would be prosecuted. "I don't think that the public or you all are going to uncover men within the Epstein files that abused women, unfortunately." Kwasi Gyamfi Asiedu, Jack Fenwick, and Chi Chi Izundu contributed to this report.

**Excerpt**

One wrong move and it could all go wrong - the men clearing deadly undersea Russian mines The Black Sea is littered with deadly weapons. But no-one knows how many – or where they are. "When we approach it, we should be quiet, we should be slow – and we should be very accurate," says Vitalii, wiggling his hand in a snake-like motion, as he describes swimming through dark waters towards the explosive devices resting on the sea floor. The tall, softly spoken 31-year-old Ukrainian Navy diver is part of a team of 20 tasked with de-mining the parts of the Black Sea still under Ukraine's control. Mines are some of the most insidious and long-lasting legacies of war. They remain active, and deadly, for decades; the ones at sea present additional risks, as they can drift with currents and storms. The sea mines laid by Moscow at the start of the full-scale invasion – when Russian ships approached Odesa – are no different. And the danger is not theoretical: last summer, three swimmers were killed by mines off the Odesa coast. The commander of the navy's mine countermeasures group – a wry, sharp-eyed young man who goes by the callsign Fox – estimates the number of sea mines is in the thousands. But they are not the only danger lurking underwater. Missiles, artillery shells, bombs and land mines were washed downstream to the sea when the Kakhovka dam was blown up in 2022. These too could be triggered to explode at any minute. "If we speak about unexploded ordnance in general - missiles, artillery shells, aerial bombs - the total number will be many times higher" than several thousand, Fox says. His team's work is as perilous as it is vital. Despite the scale of the contamination, sea traffic has not come to a halt, and a significant number of merchant ships are still operating in the only maritime export corridor out of Ukraine. For Ukraine, the effort to clear the seabed is part of a broader attempt to keep the ports on the Black Sea usable, particularly by commercial ships that bring in a stream of much-needed revenue. Aided by a huge army, on the front line Moscow manages to just about hold the upper hand, but at sea, Ukraine has succeeded in evening out the playing field. Sitting in a café overlooking the Gulf of Odesa, navy spokesman Dmytro Pletenchuk gestures towards the expanse of sea beyond the window. "There is parity in the maritime domain at the moment," he says. "We find new ways to strike them; they look for ways to counter us. What works today will not work tomorrow - on both sides. They adopt our experience; we adopt theirs." Ukrainian ships cannot move further than the area surrounding Odesa due to Russian control of much of the coast. And Moscow has too seemingly reached the conclusion that moving ships out of many of its naval bases in the Black Sea is too big a risk, as they would be within reach of Ukrainian aerial strikes. In 2024, Russia withdrew its last remaining patrol ship from occupied Crimea. "While Russia may have an advantage on land and in the air, it does not at sea," he adds. "Here, Russia's main tactic - mass - does not work." "Naval warfare is technological. You cannot overwhelm an area with 'meat'," Pletenchuk says, using the term to refer to the sheer number of soldiers at Russia's disposal. The stalemate at sea has allowed Ukraine's sea exports to continue, and a so-called grain corridor to remain operational. Maritime exports account for over two-thirds of Ukrainian agricultural exports, which some reports say add up to roughly $9bn. It is an essential source of revenue for Ukraine. Although aerial attacks remain a regular reality, vessels continue to navigate in the area. "Judging by the fact that vessel traffic has not decreased, [commercial companies] are willing to take these risks," Pletenchuk says, pointing to two large ships cruising silently on the horizon. Now, keeping the shipping routes viable also depends on removing the threat beneath the surface. Mines and unexploded ordnance are still a passive tool Russia can use to disrupt maritime traffic, even without controlling the Black Sea itself. That is where divers like Vitalii come in. "We move carefully and extremely slowly so that the mine does not detonate," Vitalii says, describing the painstakingly slow process of demining. "One second you move, then you stay still for some time, and you repeat this until you reach the object. "Generally, it's up to 20 meters before [we reach] the object, so you can try to imagine how long it takes to approach it." But before the underwater de-mining mission can even begin, Vitalii's group needs to identify the object, as missiles and a wealth of World War Two unexploded bombs sit on the seabed alongside Russian sea mines. Commander Fox explains that mines generally fall into two categories: contact mines, which detonate when struck, and influence mines, which explode when sensors detect changes in sound, pressure or magnetism. "Usually, the acoustic sensor is on duty," he says. "If it hears noise, it can activate another sensor." Large commercial ships are particularly vulnerable to magnetic mines, which respond to changes in the magnetic field. "The mine lies on the bottom and explodes when a big vessel approaches," says Fox, mimicking two magnets snapping together. "Until that moment, it just waits." Two divers approach each device in total silence, using closed-circuit rebreathers that produce no bubbles. Once a mine is identified, the actual detonation often takes place the following day. The sensors, Vitalii says, are first disabled using a series of controlled explosions with the first done from about 10 meters away. Only then can divers approach the device itself. The final decision - whether to move the mine or destroy it in place - is taken by headquarters. This surgical operation takes two days, several boats, and the work of 20 people - all operating under the constant threat of Russian missiles and drones, both aerial and seaborne, which could easily trigger the mines. During air strikes, GPS signals are scrambled, making sonar readings imprecise. De-mining the sea is not impossible, but doing so in the middle of active combat ramps up the risk considerably. "Everything can go wrong", Fox says. Vitalii nods. Once, he recalls, as he was approaching a mine using sonar, another object appeared on his screen, moving slowly through the darkness. His first thought was that it could be a Russian underwater drone, and that the mine would detonate. Then, he turned and saw four or five dolphins swimming past. "Beautiful, yes," he says, his eyes widening. "But not at that moment." According to Pletenchuk, in 2025 the de-mining group neutralised more than 50 mines - a fraction of the total. In 2023 the British Navy gifted Ukraine two mine-hunting vessels that could speed the work up – but because large ships in the Black Sea are an easy target, they are still stationed in the UK and won't be deployed until a ceasefire has been agreed. Two years after the vessels were handed over, that possibility still seems remote. In the current conditions, Vitalii says, clearing the seabed will take dozens of years. Despite the risks, revenue from maritime exports will only grow more essential for Ukraine the longer the war continues. And so divers like Vitalii will keep going back into the water - moving one second at a time, then waiting three more.

### 3. [This tiny Australian town is up for sale - but the locals don't want to leave](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3wz49z6gyyo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

This tiny Australian town is up for sale - but the locals don't want to leave Tucked away in the rugged Victorian bushland lies the tiny outpost of Licola, population: five. Consisting of a couple of weatherboard buildings, a general store, a caravan park and a petrol station grouped around a modest main street, Licola is one of Australia's smallest towns. And if you have a spare couple of million dollars, you can buy it. The entire village - a three-hour drive from the city of Melbourne - is now up for grabs, much to the shock and ire of tight-knit locals. Privately owned by a local community club, Licola has long been a guaranteed pit stop for fuel, food and rest for travellers on their way to the Alpine National Park. It also has a 50-year legacy of hosting outreach programmes for young people. But the local branch of the Lions Club says it can't afford to run the town anymore, and late last year quietly listed it for sale online. The sale has raised alarm bells for Licola's few passionate residents, locals in surrounding areas and even other Lions Clubs state members, who say they weren't fairly consulted and now hold grave fears for the future of the town. 'A home away from home' Nestled beside the banks of the mighty Macalister River in Victoria's high country, Licola was originally a timber mill, built in the 1950s with a few buildings for those working there. After it closed in 1968, the Lions Club acquired the whole site and turned it into a camp where disadvantaged young people and children, and groups with special needs, could stay during school holidays. Just around the corner from the camp, they also snapped up land which now hosts Licola's General Store and Caravan Park. Today, Leanne O'Donnell - who runs the General Store - and her family are the only full-time residents of the town. She lives there with one of her children, along with her best friend and her two kids. "It's just an amazing place," O'Donnell tells the BBC. "When I first moved here, people would come into my store and say, 'You're not going to make a million dollars in Licola.' And I'd say, 'Who said I'm here to make a million dollars?'." O'Donnell purchased the business in 2022 but doesn't own the buildings, signing a lease she says she was led to believe would be extended to a 15-year term. From day one, O'Donnell wanted Licola to be "a home away from home" for people. Nearly every person who visits, works or passes through Licola has O'Donnell's number – even truck drivers and the Country Fire Authority. "I'm the main point of contact for them, regardless of whether it's three in the afternoon or two in the morning," she said. O'Donnell is extremely passionate about the town and serving its surrounding community - but she now faces eviction. "I absolutely love this town... if it gets into the hands of a developer and turns into something that it's not, it [will] just break my heart." O'Donnell first learned Licola was headed for the market in January 2025, from the Lions Village Licola board, which is appointed to manage the town on behalf of the charity. "They told me that their business had been running at a loss for the last five or six years and I asked them, 'so how can I help you?'," O'Donnell says. "They turned around and said, unless you get a couple of million dollars, there's nothing much you can do." But O'Donnell persisted, offering to run fundraisers for the village and telling the board that the broader community will want to help. The board wouldn't budge, O'Donnell says. Eventually she said: "So you're going to buy my business?" "And they said, no, we're just going to take your business because we own the land and we own the buildings," she says. "And you just need to pack up and leave. I couldn't get it in my head and understand it at the time." After seeking legal advice, O'Donnell quickly realised that because she was signed to a lease, the board could do just that. "In the real world, I could take my business and put it in another building... that's not a problem at all anywhere else except for Licola." Here, there is nowhere else to go. By December, O'Donnell found a real estate listing online for the sale of the town, with an asking price of between A$6m (£3m, $4.3m) and $10m. Petitions and threats The sale has been met with intense backlash online from locals in the surrounding areas. Many are upset over the way O'Donnell has been treated and are concerned the beloved town could die out or be commercialised. One user's comment on the Licola Caravan Park & General Store official Facebook page says: "People rely on the store in town, and closing in the middle of peak season is stupidity at its best." Another person says selling the town "impacts MANY Victorians that come to Licola and have camped [there] for years". "There are some great past leaders of Lions and leaders of the Licola village and camp whom I know are turning in their graves," another comment says. Other Victorian Lions members wrote to the Lions Village Licola Board, accusing it of acting without due process and consultation with the broader Lions Club members it is supposed to represent. An online petition to save the store, "renew the lease and let Leanne stay", has more than 8,000 signatures. As outrage grew, the Lions Village Licola board said its staff were receiving threats and it was considering withdrawing them from the town. In a statement to the BBC, a spokesperson said the sale was prompted by a review into the town's operations, which was provided to all Lions in Victoria. After the review, the board decided it was no longer sustainable for the Lions Club to own the village, listing rising costs and insurance prices, aging accommodation, and a decline in school and camp attendance as the main reasons. "The decision to sell was not made lightly," the statement said. Chairman Denis Carruthers has said the board has a responsibility to protect the mission of the Lions Village - supporting disadvantaged youth - not just the physical space. "The Lions District Governors have been briefed and are supportive," he told the BBC. The board also said in their statement that O'Donnell's lease "was not renewed in order to consolidate revenue during a period of financial stress". O'Donnell has been told she has to vacate the premises by 31 January this year. All proceeds of the sale of the Licola properties and future business profits will be reinvested into a new foundation, which will continue to pay for children to attend camps run professionally across Victoria, it said. Whether future camps will continue to run in Licola is unknown at this stage, Carruthers added, with a planned camp for January was cancelled due to low numbers. It remains unclear who the new owners will be – or what they will want to do with the town. But, he said, there is "considerable interest in the property".

### 4. [This army chief threatened to castrate opposition leader and claimed descent from Jesus](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdjnp9m8wvgo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

This army chief threatened to castrate opposition leader and claimed descent from Jesus A fiery tweeter who is in charge of Uganda's military, Gen Muhoozi Kainerugaba is decried by his critics as being in the middle of an unholy trinity, or alliance, of three men who rule the East African nation with an iron fist. Kainerugaba, the son of the country's long-time leader Yoweri Museveni, has posted on social platform X about the killing of opposition supporters during this month's fiercely contested presidential election. In posts which were subsequently deleted, he also threatened to have the testicles of defeated opposition candidate Bobi Wine removed. With the 81-year-old president winning a seventh term, analysts say this is likely to be his last term and he is grooming his 51-year-son to succeed him. The so-called "unholy alliance" - a play on the Christian doctrine of the Holy Trinity - is made up of Museveni, Kainerugaba, and the president's powerful brother and special adviser, Salim Saleh. Kenya-based analyst for the Institute for Security Studies think-tank, Nicodemus Minde, tells the BBC that he heard the description during a recent research trip to Uganda. "The Father being Museveni, then the Son being Muhoozi, then the Unholy Spirit could be the uncle, Salim Saleh," he says. Minde describes Saleh as a "power behind the scenes", saying he was "influential in terms of money, business and access". Opposition supporters accuse the family of believing they have a God-given right to rule Uganda, with Museveni extending his 40-year-rule after he was declared the winner of the election with more than 70% of the vote. Indeed Anita Among, the speaker in the last parliament, also used the image of the holy trinity last year, as she rallied voters to back Museveni. "We believe in God the Father - and God the Father is President Museveni. God the Son is MK [Muhoozi Kainerugaba], and now you [the voters] are the Holy Spirit. Therefore, vote for them," she was quoted as saying in comments that came in for some criticism. After getting just 24% of the vote, Wine dismissed the results as "fake", claiming widespread "ballot-stuffing" was behind Museveni's victory. This incurred the wrath of Kainerugaba, who threatened the opposition leader, giving him "exactly 48 hours to surrender himself to the police". "If he doesn't we will treat him as an outlaw/rebel and handle him accordingly," he wrote. Those tweets - and the one in which he threatened to remove Wine's testicles - have since been deleted. Wine, who had gone into hiding after a raid on his house following the election, later called out the general on X and included a screengrab of some of the deleted tweets - to which Kainerugaba responded with the comment: "Boo hoo hoo Mr. 24%." Another tweet saying Wine was wanted "dead or alive" is still on his feed, even though a government minister has said the opposition leader is free to carry out his activities. The army chief later accused the US of helping Wine escape and said that all military co-operation between the two countries would be suspended. On Friday, he apologised, saying he had been given "wrong information". He subsequently announced "I intend to reduce my interactions" on the social media site. Last year, he said he would leave X before returning after just a few days. Kainerugaba has a long history of controversial posts, some of which have been later deleted, and is also known as the "tweeting general". He has also invoked religion to advance his political aspirations. "I fear no one on this planet because my bloodline is from Jesus Christ," he posted earlier this month. This tweet has also been deleted. A long-time friend of the general, who spoke on condition of anonymity, says he is "incredibly loyal", and compares his posting to US President Donald Trump. "He might be Trumpian, but that's him expressing himself," the friend tells the BBC. He says "it is wrong to try to understand him from the tweets that he posts", adding that Kainerugaba is "a man of complex character". Minde describes the general's posts as often "wild", but says that many of his comments can make sense when viewed within the context of Uganda's succession politics - in particular Kainerugaba's bid to position himself as his father's heir. "He probably wants to endear himself to his father," Minde tells the BBC, but adds that some of the posts are deliberate "provocations". He says that Kainerugaba's statements do little to win him public favour. Kainerugaba's friend, on the other hand, tells the BBC the general would be an "incredible successor" to his father. He points out that Uganda is a post-conflict country where security is all-important. "This is our number-one priority, to make sure that you are peaceful and stable and [Kainerugaba] is very experienced in that sphere. He's been doing this all his life," he adds. However, some of his posts could threaten international relations if taken at face-value. In 2022 he threatened to invade neighbouring Kenya, triggering a backlash from Kenyans who trolled him for his "reckless" comments. He responded by urging them to "relax", but as the row escalated, Museveni was forced to phone his Kenyan counterpart William Ruto to apologise for his son's "mistake". Kainerugaba has in the past downplayed some of his remarks as "musings" and "abstractions" that do not need to be taken seriously. Uganda-based security analyst Freddie David Egesa observes that the military chief "enjoys having that kind of vibe". "He sometimes likes joking around it," Egesa says. Kainerugaba's friend says the general is "a kind, generous, intensely smart person who spends all his time thinking about the peace and security of this country". He adds that the general executes his responsibilities to the best of his abilities. "And that's why he serves in the role that he serves." Critics say Kainerugaba has brooked little opposition in the country, acting decisively against anyone perceived as a threat to his father's administration. By the general's own admission on X, at least 30 people were killed and 2,000 others detained by security officers following the recent elections. Before the polls, opposition rallies were disrupted, with security forces at times opening fire. The United Nations said the election was held in an "environment marked by widespread repression and intimidation against the political opposition". Kainerugaba played a role in the four-day internet blackout that lasted until after the elections, Reuters news agency quoted Andrew Mwenda, a Ugandan political commentator and close ally of the general, as saying. The internet remained partially restricted afterwards, but on Monday, Kainerugaba posted that access to all social media platforms was being restored. "We are releasing all social media today," he wrote. On the same day, he took to X to deny that his soldiers had beaten up Bobi Wine's wife Barbara Kyagulanyi. She had alleged from her hospital bed on Saturday that military officers had assaulted her overnight as they searched for her husband. According to Minde, Kainerugaba's actions appear driven by loyalty or a desire to protect Museveni's administration. The general's first name, Muhoozi, means avenger. "I named him Muhoozi, which means vengeance, such that when someone wrongs me, he avenges," Museveni once explained. Kainerugaba, who was born in 1974, grew up in exile in Tanzania, Kenya and Sweden before his father took power in 1986 after overthrowing the brutal regime of Milton Obote. He joined the military in 1999, enrolled at the UK's elite Sandhurst military academy and graduated the following year. He is married with several children. He rapidly rose through the military ranks shortly after joining the army, reaching the rank of lieutenant-general 10 years later. He was promoted to a full general in 2022. He played a pivotal role in the formation of the Special Forces Command (SFC), an elite military unit responsible for his father's security. The SFC has been accused of involvement in a wave of abductions and torture of opposition members. It has denied the allegations, but some of its officers have been convicted of abusing their power. The most prominent case was that of a 32-year-old SFC soldier, who was court-martialled and sentenced to death in 2024 for shooting dead three people and injuring two others, including a one-year-old child. And after a bodyguard of Wine, Edward Sebuufu went missing last May, Kainerugaba revealed on X that he was in detention "in my basement", and sparked a social media storm after he published a photo of him appearing half-naked and with his beard shaved off. As with Wine, he threatened to castrate Sebuufu. Wine has alleged that members of the SFC, as well as the military, were behind a raid on his home the day after the election. The unit is viewed as a shadow army that has helped Museveni, along with his ever-growing family dynasty, to consolidate power. The latest addition to the political dynasty is Kainerugaba's son, Ruhamya, who has joined the army - seen as the first step to acquiring power in Uganda. In the years to come, the composition of the trinity could change, with Kainerugaba as the Father, Ruhamya as the Son and another family patriarch succeeding Saleh as the Spirit.

Stay or go - what's next for coyote that escaped to Alcatraz? A lone coyote that swam more than a mile across the San Francisco Bay to Alcatraz Island is being monitored by scientists and could be moved if its presence threatens birds on the infamous Californian island. The canine, called Floyd, appears to be thriving on The Rock - renowned for its abandoned prison - and getting by on an avian diet. Whether Floyd can stay on Alcatraz "depends entirely on how it behaves", says Aidan Moore, a local tour guide who shared footage of the coyote's journey. Complicating matters, he adds, is that there are no fresh water sources, which could make the animal's welfare dependent on human intervention. Video footage of Floyd - believed to be a male - hopping onto Alcatraz's rocks was captured by a tourist and shared with Moore. The gaunt coyote appeared to be shivering from the bay water which is about 10C (50F). But he has plumped up since, says Moore, who is originally from the Cotswolds, in England. On Saturday, the Golden Gate National Recreation Area (GGNRA) observed and photographed the coyote. The GGNRA confirmed to the BBC that the animal is believed to be the same coyote seen swimming to and coming ashore on the island nearly two weeks earlier. This coyote is the first documented coyote presence on Alcatraz since the island was transferred to the National Park Service in 1972, the GGNRA said. Park biologists and staff are actively monitoring the coyote to better understand how it is surviving on the 22-acre (89,030m) island and to assess any potential impacts to the seabird breeding colony, the GGNRA said. The coyote's presence, it added, does not affect public access to the island, which remains open to visitors. Alcatraz island - nicknamed "the Rock" because it was regarded as an impregnable fortress - is home to the shuttered federal penitentiary that housed some of the most dangerous criminals in the US. It also served as the backdrop of the 1996 action thriller The Rock starring Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage and the 1979 drama Escape from Alcatraz with Clint Eastwood. Coyotes, the wolf-like creatures that are native to North America, are not uncommon in the San Francisco Bay. According to Moore, nearby Angel Island has at least 16 coyotes that are thriving there because there's fresh water and bigger prey, such as deer, that they can hunt. But not so on Alcatraz, part of Golden Gate National Recreation Area, and a registered sanctuary for seabirds, whose sensitive nesting time runs from February through September. Floyd has to be able to catch enough birds to sustain his dietary needs, Moore says, and suspects that catching them is like shooting fish in a barrel given the thousands of birds there. Floyd might also be staying hydrated with rain puddles and by water from the gardens on the island, said Janet Kessler, a self-taught naturalist who has been documenting coyote behaviour in San Francisco for about 20 years. Kessler told the BBC that she suspects Floyd made the journey because he might have felt interspecies territorial pressure in the city and needed to find a new area to call home. "He can't go anywhere. When he gets to a territory, they're going to drive him out of that territory, because that's what coyotes do," Kessler said. "That's actually what limits our population. That's their natural population control is their territoriality." Coyotes could be leaving the mainland because the Bay Area is becoming too crowded, Brett Furnas, a wildlife ecologist with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, told the Los Angeles Times. The species was driven out of the city but re-emerged about 25 years ago, he said, since which sightings have increased. While coyotes are adaptable and natural survivalists, tour guide Moore is worried about Floyd's future and is pushing for human intervention. But finding him might be a challenge as coyotes are "masters of disguise", he says. And the coyote seems to be hiding in areas that are not accessible to the public. Moore and his colleagues have been trying to spot him on their walks, but instead have only found evidence he is leaving behind, like half-eaten birds. Some of his droppings have been collected and are undergoing DNA testing to get a better sense of Floyd's origins, he says. Whether he will stay or go appears to be dependent on his behaviour too, and the tourists visiting the island. Project Coyote, a North American organization focusing on science-based education around the animals and coexistence, is concerned that the barrage of visitors to Alcatraz could pose safety risks for both the animal and tourists. Most conflicts with coyotes stem from humans either intentionally or unintentionally feeding them, says Project Coyote founder Camilla Fox. "Coyotes are incredibly resourceful and able to coexist with coyotes even in the most densely populated urban environments," Fox told the BBC. "So if not harassed, we believe this coyote could survive on the island- though it could be a lonely existence without a mate. "We hope whatever decision is made by the National Park Service, this coyote will have an opportunity to thrive and flourish." Kessler, the naturalist, believes this coyote might leave the island at some point because it's too small of a territory. "This is new to everybody. We're all going to be watching and seeing what this coyote does," Kessler said. "I would assume, at some point, if he wants to go back, he'll swim."

Former CNN host Don Lemon charged over anti-ICE protest at Minnesota church Former CNN host Don Lemon has appeared before a judge after being arrested for entering a Minnesota church and filming anti-immigration enforcement protesters as they disrupted a service. After appearing in court, Lemon was released from custody. He told media outside that he was arrested for covering the news, adding: "I will not be silenced." The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said he was charged with "conspiracy to deprive rights" and "violation of the FACE Act", by allegedly interfering in someone's First Amendment rights by force. Lemon went into the Cities Church in St Paul on 18 January with protesters who said one of the pastors was an immigration enforcement official. Lemon, an independent journalist, said he was taken into custody by federal agents on Thursday. He did not enter a plea in court. "Last night the DOJ sent a team of federal agents to arrest me in the middle of the night for something that I have been doing for the last 30 years and that is covering the news," Lemon said. "I have spent my entire covering the news. I will not stop now," Lemon added. "In fact, there is no more important time than right now, this very moment, for a free and independent media that shines a light on the truth and holds those in power accountable." Lemon has been charged with violation of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances and Places of Religious Worship (FACE) act, which is a law that typically has been used to crack down on demonstrations at abortion clinics but also prohibits obstructing access to houses of worship. "Don will fight these charges vigorously and thoroughly in court," his lawyer Abbe Lowell said earlier on Friday in a statement posted on Lemon's Instagram account. The lawyer added: "This unprecedented attack on the First Amendment and transparent attempt to distract attention from the many crises facing this administration will not stand." Lowell said Lemon had been arrested while he was in Los Angeles covering the Grammy Awards. US Attorney General Pam Bondi said three others had been arrested: local independent journalist Georgia Fort, along with activists Trahem Jeen Crews and Jamael Lydell Lundy. Fort was also released earlier on Friday after her court appearance in Minnesota. America's top law enforcement official accused them of participating in a "coordinated attack" on the church. FBI Director Kash Patel said investigators from his agency and the DHS had arrested Lemon and the other three. Fort posted a livestream of federal agents arriving at her home to arrest her. "Agents are at my door right now," she said in the clip. "My children are here, they're impacted by this." President Donald Trump's administration initially sought to charge eight people involved in the Minnesota church protest with conspiring to deprive rights and interfering with someone's religious freedom in a house of worship. But a magistrate judge who reviewed the evidence approved charges for only three of those involved, excluding Lemon. The government challenged that decision, but an appeals court suggested prosecutors take the case to a federal grand jury - a panel of citizens that evaluates if there is enough evidence to charge someone in a case. A longstanding Trump critic, Lemon was fired from CNN in April 2023 after 17 years with the company. The morning show host had apologised for on-air comments that Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley, then 51, was past her prime. In the Minnesota church protest, he live-streamed with protesters on YouTube. The broadcast began with Lemon standing with the group in a car park where he says: "This is an operation that is secret. "I can't tell you what is going to happen, but you're going to watch it live unfold here on 'The Don Lemon Show.'" He followed the group - whom he called "resistance protesters" - into the church, initially without his camera operator. His microphone picked up audio of a woman shouting "excuse me pastor". Protesters chant "Justice for Renee Good", referring to the US citizen who was fatally shot in her vehicle on 7 January during a confrontation with an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer in Minneapolis. Footage showed a chaotic scene unfolding inside the church, which belongs to the Southern Baptist Convention, as protesters and members of the congregation shout at each other. Lemon repeatedly says he is there as a journalist and is unaffiliated with demonstrators. "We're not part of the activists, but we're here just reporting on them," he says. The pastor says: "This is unacceptable, it's shameful. It's shameful to interrupt a public gathering of Christians in worship." Harmeet Dhillon, of the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division, said during an interview with podcaster Megyn Kelly on Friday: "We're going to pursue this to the ends of the Earth." The White House appeared to celebrate the arrest, posting a photo of Lemon on its official X account with the caption "when life gives you lemons", next to an emoji of chain links. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass called the detention of Lemon "shocking" and "alarming." CNN said it raised "profoundly concerning questions about press freedom and the First Amendment". The network said it would follow Lemon's case closely. This is the second high-profile incident this month of the Trump administration investigating a journalist, raising the alarm of free speech advocates. On 14 January, the FBI showed up unannounced to the home of a Washington Post reporter with a search warrant and seized her devices over the alleged leak of classified information, although she herself was not charged with any crime. Protests are continuing in Minnesota, where an operation by federal immigration agents has sparked confrontations that have left two US citizens dead: Renee Good, a mother-of-three, and Alex Pretti, a nurse.

**Excerpt**

Civil rights investigation opened into Alex Pretti shooting The Department of Justice (DOJ) has opened a civil rights investigation into the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by federal immigration agents, the US deputy attorney general has said. Todd Blanche said he did not want to "overstate" the move, calling it "a standard investigation by the FBI when there are circumstances like what we saw". The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said the FBI would lead the investigation into Pretti's shooting in Minneapolis, with support from the DOJ's Civil Rights Division. His death came just weeks after Renee Good was shot dead by federal officers in the same city. "We're looking at everything that would shed light on that day," Blanche told a news conference. He added the investigation would "to the extent it needs to" involve lawyers at the civil rights division. The investigation was previously being led by the Homeland Security Investigations branch of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the BBC's US partner CBS News reported. Two agents involved in Pretti's shooting have been placed on administrative leave while the incident is investigated, the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said on Thursday. According to a preliminary DHS report sent to Congress, two officers fired their weapons at Pretti during a scuffle. Initial official accounts had alleged Pretti brandished his gun. The 37-year-old intensive care nurse, who was a US citizen, is understood to have joined protests in the city after Renee Good was shot dead by an ICE agent in Minneapolis on 7 January. Their deaths sparked fresh demonstrations in the state, and prompted public outcry across the US and criticism from lawmakers in both parties. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey have called for federal agents to be withdrawn entirely from the state's capital region. The state has also asked a federal judge to stop Operation Metro Surge, the DHS's immigration enforcement initiative which began on 1 December and involves some 3,000 officers. President Donald Trump has said his administration is "going to de-escalate a little bit" in Minnesota, while his border tsar Tom Homan said on Thursday that the administration planned to "draw down" federal forces if local officials co-operated. "We are not surrendering our mission at all. We're just doing it smarter," Homan told a news conference in Minneapolis, without specifying what form a de-escalation might take.

**Excerpt**

An ingredient for this curry is missing - and in eight minutes, it's at the door Tanisha Singh is getting ready for work early one morning and cooking a simple curry for her lunchbox when she realises she's out of tomatoes. Onions are already frying in the pan. Going out to buy vegetables is not an option, as local vegetable vendors won't be open. So Tanisha picks up her phone. On a quick-delivery app, tomatoes are available. Eight minutes later, the doorbell rings. The tomatoes have arrived. What might feel remarkable in some parts of the world has become commonplace in Delhi and other big Indian cities. Groceries, books, soft drinks and even the occasional iPhone can now be delivered to people's doorsteps in minutes. It's a convenience many don't strictly need, yet have quickly grown used to. Unlike traditional retailers, platforms such as Blinkit, Swiggy, Instamart and Zepto don't deliver from large supermarkets or distant warehouses. Instead, they operate out of small storage units embedded deep inside residential neighbourhoods. Known as "dark stores", these facilities are typically located just a few kilometres from customers, allowing delivery riders to reach homes in minutes. Think of them as a mini version of Costco - packed with essentials, but designed purely for speed. And because customers never walk into these spaces, everything inside is arranged for fast picking rather than browsing. To see how this works, the BBC visited one such dark store in north-west Delhi. Inside, goods are stacked neatly on racks - with vegetables in one section, freezer units in another corner, and shelves stuffed with crisps, fizzy drinks and even pet food. The aisles are so narrow only the workers can weave through them, moving fast and rarely bumping into each other. The moment an order pops up on the screen, workers jump into action - picking, scanning, and packing items into the trademark brown paper bags with such speed it almost feels robotic. "Done in under a minute," store manager Sagar says proudly. Delivery riders walk up to the counter, almost in tune with the packers. Packing and pickup happen almost simultaneously - every step planned to reduce the time taken, even by seconds. Delivery driver Muhammad Faiyaz Alam is 26. He collects a brown bag and agrees to let us join him for the ride. The destination is 2.2km (1.4 miles) away, about six minutes, according to the digital map. There are no traffic lights on the route and he drives swiftly through narrow streets. But the delivery doesn't end when we reach the location pin. In many dense Delhi neighbourhoods, lanes split unexpectedly, buildings look similar and proper addresses are often missing - things digital maps rarely catch. People usually rely on landmarks instead - like "near the blue gate" or "behind the chemist" and so on. Here, the drop‑off is "near a public bank ATM", which is not immediately visible. So Alam calls the customer, follows their directions and eventually spots the right door. From order to doorstep, the entire process takes 16 minutes. Alam earns 31 rupees (£0.25; $0.30). He doesn't waste time after delivering the order and quickly heads back to the dark store, where another order is already waiting. The cycle repeats for hours, interrupted only by short food breaks. The startlingly quick pace is closely tied to how riders are paid. Alam says he tries to complete around 40 deliveries a day. On a good day, he takes home between 900 and 1,000 rupees, after deducting money spent on fuel and food. But his earnings fluctuate constantly, depending on order volume, distance, and the incentives offered by the app. He is one of millions working in India's rapidly expanding gig economy, which is expected to employ 23.5 million people by 2030. Low-paid convenience work is nothing new in India, but what has changed in recent years is the scale. Digital platforms have turned informal deliveries into a vast, app-driven workforce governed by algorithms. Like most gig workers, Alam is classified as a "partner", not an employee. He gets no fixed salary, no paid leave, and no social security. Although the government has promised labour reforms that could offer basic protections to gig workers, they are yet to be implemented. Each day, Alam, like many other riders, logs in to the app and books his work slots, also called "gig slots". The idea is simple - the more deliveries riders complete during those windows, the more "streak" incentives they unlock, boosting their pay and rewarding longer hours. In December, Alam says he earned an additional 16,000 rupees through incentives alone. He completed more than 1,000 orders and worked 406 hours that month. But this setup can unravel quickly for drivers. Earlier this month, Alam's phone was stolen mid-shift. He had already worked five consecutive days for more than 12 hours and was just two days away from earning another 5,000-rupee incentive. Without his phone, he could not log in and his streak reset instantly. "I was sad for a few days," Alam says. "But what can I do? At least I got the standard pay." This incentive structure is not unique to India, but it is intensified by labour availability and weak worker protections, says researcher and author Vandana Vasudevan. "These workers are classified as independent contractors, not salaried employees," she says. "They have no social security or benefits, yet algorithms still control their work through ratings, penalties and pay." This pressure shows on the roads. Alam admits he often speeds, squeezes through traffic and sometimes jumps signals to stay on target. Late deliveries can trigger customer complaints or warnings from managers. Last month, delivery workers in several Indian cities went on strike over falling incomes, unpredictable incentives and unsafe conditions. It sparked a massive social media debate and the labour ministry ordered platforms to drop aggressive marketing language promising "10-minute deliveries". Experts say the move may not dramatically alter daily conditions for riders, but it does remove the expectation that every order should arrive within a fixed time. To understand why that pressure exists at all, it helps to look at how quick commerce has grown in Indian cities. The sector exploded after the pandemic, when lockdowns kept people indoors and crowded markets felt unsafe. In many Western countries, grocery delivery services such as Getir surged during that period - but once the restrictions eased and people returned to supermarkets - many scaled back or were forced to shut down. India, however, followed a different trajectory. "In other countries platforms avoid committing to a fixed 10-minute promise and instead use terms like 'very fast' - thus lowering customer expectations. They also charge a premium for faster delivery, but in India there are no such constraints," she adds. Here, you can even order a single avocado - and while it may cost a bit more than buying it from the neighbourhood shop, many urban consumers are willing to pay that premium simply to save time. That willingness has driven its growth in metropolitan cities, says Ankur Bisen, a partner at retail advisory firm Technopak. "Quick commerce has tapped into a huge pool of time-poor urban residents who spend long hours commuting and would rather order in essentials than step out again," he says. Despite the buzz, quick commerce remains a small fraction of India's total retail economy and profitability remains elusive. "They're still losing money," Bisen says, adding that these players are yet to come up with a sustainable business model. Intense competition between Blinkit, Swiggy, Instamart, Zepto and now even Amazon keeps pushing companies to chase customers with ever-shorter delivery promises and heavy discounts in a price-sensitive market. For users like Singh, quick commerce has shifted from an occasional convenience to a daily habit. "It's not that I can't live without quick delivery," she says. "But I've grown so used to it that we forget it is a rare privilege and that there is human labour behind it." There are signs that awareness is beginning to shift. A recent survey by community platform LocalCircles found that 74% of respondents supported the government's decision to drop the "10-minute delivery" tagline. Nearly 40% said they were willing to wait longer for their groceries, rather than receive them at ultra-fast speed. Whether that willingness translates into meaningful change on the ground remains uncertain. For now, the speed of India's cities is still being measured in minutes - and carried on the backs of workers who have little choice but to keep moving.
