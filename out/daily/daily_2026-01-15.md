Iran judiciary denies plan to execute detained protester Erfan Soltani Iran's judiciary has denied it scheduled the execution of a man arrested in connection with the country's recent protests. Norway-based Kurdish human rights organisation Hengaw said earlier this week that the family of Erfan Soltani, 26, had been told he faced execution on Wednesday, only days after he was detained. On Wednesday, Hengaw cited them as saying Soltani's execution had been "postponed" but warned that "serious and ongoing concerns" regarding his life remained. "This is good news. Hopefully, it will continue!" said US President Donald Trump, who had warned Iran not to execute protesters. The Iranian judiciary said Soltani faced charges of "colluding against national security" and "propaganda activities against the establishment", which are not punishable by the death penalty, state broadcaster IRIB reported. It called reports by foreign media organisations that Soltani faced execution a "blatant act of news fabrication". Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi also said in an interview with US television that there was "no plan" to hang people. It came after Trump threatened to take "very strong action" if executions were carried out, amid mounting speculation of possible US military strikes. On Wednesday, he told reporters that "very important sources on the other side" had informed him "the killing in Iran is stopping, and there's no plan for executions". Soltani, a clothes shop owner, was arrested at his home last Thursday in connection with the protests in the northern city of Fardis, west of Tehran, according to the group and his family. However, the judiciary said he was arrested during "riots" on Saturday and was being held in a prison in the neighbouring city of Karaj, according to IRIB. Speaking to the BBC from Europe, a cousin called Somaya said Soltani was still in jail and she remained concerned about him, although she had heard very little news because of the internet blackout in Iran. However she said a message sent via the Starlink satellite internet service had said he had not had a defence lawyer and his family were under a lot of pressure from the authorities. "Erfan is the heart of that family. He's a very calm, very kind person," she said, adding that he loved photography, sport and animals and had just wanted "basic rights" for himself and the people of Iran. "He had thousands of hopes for himself and other young people." Somaya said the Iranian government had hoped that executing Erfan would "scare people into stopping the protests". "They didn't have any reason to arrest Erfan. There are many Erfans. The only strategy of the government is to end the protests this way," she said. Later on Thursday, the US Treasury department said Trump had directed it to impose new sanctions on five senior Iranian officials whom it accused of being "the architects of the Iranian regime's brutal crackdown on peaceful demonstrators". They included the secretary of the Supreme Council for National Security, Ali Larijani, who the Treasury said co-ordinated the response to the protests, as well as the commanders of the Revolutionary Guards and police forces in the western province of Lorestan and southern province of Fars, where the Treasury said security personnel had shot dead many civilians. Responding to the judiciary's statement, the director of the Norway-based group Iran Human Rights said threats of the death penalty against detainees and their families were not uncommon. The chief justice, Gholamhossein Mohseni-Ejei, has advocated for the swift trial and punishment of arrested "rioters". "Those elements who beheaded people in the streets or burned people alive must be tried and punished as quickly as possible," he said in a video on Wednesday. "If we don't do it fast, it won't have the same impact." Justice Minister Amin Hossein Rahimi meanwhile said that any individual arrested during the protests that took place between last Thursday and Saturday was "definitely a criminal". Over the past three years, Iran has hanged at least 12 men who were sentenced to death in connection with the 2022 "Woman, Life, Freedom" protests. Human rights groups said their convictions came after torture-tainted "confessions" and grossly unfair trials. The current wave of protests began after shopkeepers in Tehran went on strike over the rising cost of living and the depreciating value of the currency. They quickly spread across the country and turned against Iran's clerical establishment, particularly the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The slogans chanted by demonstrators have included "Death to the dictator" and "Seyyed Ali [Khamenei] will be toppled this year". The protests escalated significantly last Thursday and were met with deadly force by authorities, masked by a near total shutdown of the internet and communication services. According to the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), at least 2,453 protesters have been killed since the unrest began, as well as 14 children, 156 people affiliated with the security forces or government, and 14 uninvolved civilians. It reports that another 18,470 protesters have been arrested. Iran Human Rights says it has so far verified the killing of at least 3,428 protesters by security forces and estimates that around 20,000 people have been arrested. Canada's Foreign Minister, Anita Anand, said on Thursday that a Canadian citizen had "died in Iran at the hands of Iranian authorities", without identifying them. "Peaceful protests by the Iranian people - asking that their voices be heard in the face of the Iranian regime's repression and ongoing human rights violations - have led the regime to flagrantly disregard human life," she added. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies also said a staff member of the Iranian Red Crescent, Amir Ali Latifi, had been killed and five of his colleagues wounded "in the line of duty in Gilan province" on 10 January.

Venezuelan Nobel Peace Prize winner presents her medal to Trump Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado has told reporters that she presented the medal for her Nobel Peace Prize to President Donald Trump at a private White House meeting on Thursday, but did not say if he accepted it. "I think today is a historic day for us Venezuelans," she said after meeting Trump, the first time the two have met in-person. In the weeks after US forces seized Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in Caracas, Trump has declined to endorse Machado, whose movement claimed victory in 2024's widely contested elections, as its new leader. He is instead dealing with the acting head of state there, Delcy Rodríguez, Maduro's former vice-president. After leaving the White House, Machado spoke to supporters gathered at the gates outside, telling them in Spanish, according to the Associated Press: "We can count on President Trump." "I presented the president of the United States the medal of the Nobel Peace Prize," Machado later told journalists in English, calling it "a recognition for his unique commitment with our freedom". It is not clear whether Trump accepted the award. Trump, who often speaks about his desire to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, had expressed displeasure when it was given to Machado and she decided to accept the honour last year. The BBC has reached out to the White House for comment. Machado said last week that she would share it with Trump, but the Nobel Committee later clarified that it was not transferable. "Once a Nobel Prize is announced, it cannot be revoked, shared, or transferred to others," the committee said in a statement last week. "The decision is final and stands for all time." Asked for a reaction to Machado's remarks, the committee directed the BBC to their previous statement. Before the White House meeting on Thursday, the Nobel Peace Center posted on X that "a medal can change owners, but the title of a Nobel Peace Prize laureate cannot". In her remarks, Machado described how the Marquis de Lafayette, who fought in America's Revolutionary War, gave a medal bearing the likeness of George Washington to Simon Bolivar, one of the founding fathers of modern Venezuela. The gift was "a sign of the brotherhood" between her country and the US "in their fight for freedom against tyranny," Machado said. "And 200 years in history, the people of Bolivar are giving back to the heir of Washington a medal - in this case a medal of the Nobel Peace Prize - as a recognition for his unique commitment with our freedom," she said. Machado also visited Congress to meet US senators during her visit to Washington, where her remarks to reporters were drowned out by supporters chanting "María, presidente" and waving Venezuelan flags. Machado had been expected to use her time with Trump to try to persuade him that backing Rodríguez's interim government was a mistake, and that her opposition coalition should be in charge of this transition. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters as the meeting was underway on Thursday that Machado is "a remarkable and brave voice for many of the people of Venezuela" and that Trump "was looking forward to this meeting and expecting a frank and positive discussion" about the current realities of life in Venezuela. Trump has previously described Machado as a "freedom fighter", but rejected the notion of appointing her to lead Venezuela after Maduro's removal, arguing that she lacks sufficient domestic support. Since Maduro was seized on 3 January, the Trump administration has moved quickly to remake Venezuela's oil sector, which had been under US sanctions. On Wednesday an American official said the US had completed its first sale of Venezuelan oil, valued at $500m (£373m). Oil tankers suspected of transporting sanctioned Venezuelan oil have also been seized by the US, with US forces saying they had boarded a sixth tanker on Thursday. A Venezuelan government envoy is expected to travel to Washington on Thursday to meet US officials and take initial steps toward reopening the country's embassy, the New York Times reported. The emissary is reported to be a close ally and friend of Rodríguez, who has been described as "extremely co-operative" by the White House. Rodríguez delivered the annual Message to the Nation speech in Caracas on Thursday, in which she said she was willing to attend meetings in Washington as well. "If I ever have to go to Washington as acting president, I will do so standing tall, walking, and not crawling," she said, calling on the country to "not be afraid of diplomacy" with the US. Trump and Rodríguez also spoke by phone on Wednesday, with Trump later describing his counterpart on social media as "a terrific person". Rodríguez, meanwhile, described the call as "productive and courteous" and characterised by "mutual respect."

Iran authorities demanding large sums for return of protesters' bodies, BBC told Families of people killed in the protests in Iran have told the BBC that the authorities are demanding large sums of money to return their bodies for burial. Multiple sources have told BBC Persian that bodies are being held in mortuaries and hospitals and that security forces will not release them unless their relatives hand over money. At least 2,435 people have been killed during more than two weeks of protests across the country. One family in the northern city of Rasht told the BBC that security forces demanded 700 million tomans ($5,000; £3,700) to release the body of their loved one. It was being held at the Poursina Hospital mortuary, along with at least 70 other dead protesters, they said. Meanwhile in Tehran, the family of a Kurdish seasonal construction worker went to collect his body, only to be told they must pay a billion tomans ($7,000; £5,200) to receive it. The family told the BBC that they could not afford the fee and were forced to leave without their son's body. A construction worker in Iran typically earns less than $100 a month. In some cases, hospital staff have phoned the relatives of the dead to give them an advance warning to come and get the bodies before security forces can extort any funds. BBC Persian has been told about a woman - who we are not identifying for her safety - who did not know her husband was killed until she received a phone call on 9 January on his phone from hospital staff. They told her she should quickly come and collect his body before security forces arrived and demanded payment for its release. BBC Persian was told about this situation by a London-based relative, who has spoken to her. The woman then took her two children to the hospital to find her husband's body. She put it in the back of a pickup truck, and drove for seven hours to their hometown in western Iran to bury him. "I rode in the back of the pickup truck, crying over his body for seven hours while my children sat in the front seat," she told her London relative. BBC Persian has also received reports that officials at Tehran's Behesht-e Zahra mortuary are telling families that if they claim their child was a member of the Basij paramilitary force and was killed by protesters, the body will be released without charge. The family member told the BBC in a message: "We were asked to participate in a pro-government rally and portray the body as that of a martyr. We did not agree to this." In another case in Tehran, a source told BBC Persian that several families broke into a mortuary to retrieve bodies out of fear they would be taken away by the authorities. "Several families, fearing that the authorities might keep the bodies or bury them without their knowledge, broke open the morgue door and pulled the bodies out of ambulances," the source told the BBC. The families then guarded the bodies for several hours on the ground in the hospital courtyard to prevent them from being taken away until they could find private ambulances to transport them, the source said. An internet and communications blackout has made it difficult to get a full picture of what is happening on the ground. International human-rights groups have no direct access to the country and, along with other international news organisations, the BBC is not allowed by the Iranian government to report on the ground. Demonstrations began in the capital, Tehran, on 29 December, following a sharp fall in the value of the Iranian currency against the dollar. As the protests reached dozens of other towns and cities, they turned against Iran's clerical rulers and security forces launched a violent crackdown. The protests escalated significantly last Thursday and were met with deadly force by authorities. According to the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), at least 2,435 protesters have been killed since the unrest began, as well as 13 children and 153 people affiliated with the security forces or government. It reports that another 18,470 protesters have been arrested. Meanwhile, arrests have continued across the country. Security forces and Revolutionary Guard intelligence units have detained activists, lawyers, and ordinary citizens.

Votes being counted in Uganda election as opposition alleges rigging Votes are being counted in parts of Uganda amid an internet shutdown and opposition accusations of rigging in presidential and parliamentary elections. "Massive ballot-stuffing reported everywhere," declared presidential hopeful Bobi Wine in a post on social media, without providing documentary proof. The authorities have not responded to his allegations of electoral fraud, nor to his claim that "many" polling agents and supervisors belonging to his NUP party were "abducted, and others chased off polling stations". Delays of up to four hours have been blamed on malfunctioning biometric machines used to verify voters' identities. Some have linked the problems to the network outage - plus a lack of voting materials, and equipment not arriving at some stations on time. Polling stations therefore closed later than planned. The electoral commission says that anybody who joined the queue by 17:00 local time (14:00GMT) was able to cast their ballot. Earlier on, the electoral agency apologised for the "technical glitches" and said officials were working to resolve them. In the presidential race, Yoweri Museveni, 81, in power since 1986, is seeking a seventh successive victory as he faces a challenge from Bobi Wine, a charismatic 43-year-old pop star. The result of the presidential vote will be announced by 16:00 local time (13:00 GMT) on Saturday, the electoral commission has said. Voting had finished by 18:00 local time in the polling stations in the capital, Kampala visited by the BBC, despite the delays. While data on turnout has not yet been published, this suggests that some people may have gone home without voting. However, others were determined to cast their ballots and there was widespread frustration at the problems in the morning. "I'm angry because I have not voted up to now. We are meant to start at seven, but up to now [08:00] we haven't started. The ballots papers are not even there, I don't even know what to say," Kaweesi Ismail, a voter in Kampala, told the BBC. Election chief Simon Byabakama ordered the use of the national voters' register where biometric machines failed to function. The problems appear to have affected both areas seen as pro-government as well as those thought to be opposition strongholds. Casting his vote in his native Rwakitura Village in the western Mbarara region, President Museveni said he had also experienced difficulties. "I put my thumbprint on the machine but it did not accept it. However, my face was accepted instantly by the machine. The machine works," he said. Asked if he would accept the election outcome, the president said: "This is one of the manipulations - we have to find out why, what was the problem?" "We are now verifying whether this was deliberate," he added. The presidential poll is essentially a two-horse race between Museveni and Wine, but given the president has won the six previous elections, analysts say he is likely to further extend his time in power. Wine has promised to tackle corruption and impose sweeping reforms, while Museveni argues he is the sole guarantor of stability and progress in the country. The campaign period was marred by the disruption of opposition activities - security forces have been accused of assaulting and detaining Wine's supporters. Police spokesperson Kituuma Rusoke dismissed these complaints, accusing opposition supporters, particularly those belonging to Wine's National Unity Platform (NUP) party, of being disruptive. Internet access was suspended on Tuesday, with Uganda's Communications Commission saying the blackout was necessary to prevent misinformation, fraud and the incitement of violence - a move condemned by the UN human rights office as "deeply worrying". The NUP has rejected this explanation, accusing the regulator of trying to stop the opposition from mobilising and sharing evidence of election fraud. The party has launched an offline vote-monitoring app in case of a blackout. The app, called Bitchat, uses Bluetooth technology to share images of the results forms from polling stations and voting data without internet access, according to Wine. The former leader of a guerrilla army, Museveni has benefitted from two constitutional amendments - removing age and term limits - that have allowed him to keep running for office. Wine, real name Robert Kyagulanyi, lost to the president in the 2021 elections, although Wine dismissed the results, alleging fraud. Alongside Museveni and Wine, six other presidential candidates are on this year's ballot papers. Voters will also chose a new parliament, with 353 seats up for grabs. For many of those voting on Thursday, the economy is the key issue. The majority of the population is under 30 and although the average income is steadily rising, there are not enough jobs for all the young people looking for work. There are also concerns about poor infrastructure and disparities in access to quality education and healthcare. During the campaign period, opposition supporters have faced escalating harassment, including arrest on politically motivated charges, according to both the United Nations and Amnesty International. Wine's rallies, unlike those of Museveni, have been disrupted by security forces. Amnesty has described the use of tear gas, pepper spray, beatings and other violent acts as "a brutal campaign of repression" ahead of the vote.

**Excerpt**

Pitfalls loom as Trump's Gaza peace plan enters second phase On the face of it, the announcement of phase two of President Donald Trump's peace plan for Gaza would seem like progress. But there remains a huge lack of clarity and detail about the future of the strip and the 2.1 million Palestinians who live there. Furthermore, there are many pitfalls. First, Trump's plan demands that Hamas, as well as other groups in Gaza, agree to disarm. Announcing phase two of the deal, the US Special Envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, said failure to do so would "bring serious consequences". But Hamas has so far adamantly refused to give up its weapons, which it sees as tools of resistance to Israel's decades-long military occupation. If it maintains that position, there are already far-right members of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition government who are champing at the bit to resume the war and "finish the job". While massively diminished militarily, US intelligence has long estimated that Hamas has likely recruited more new members in Gaza than have been killed by Israel during the war. The ceasefire, which has been in place since October last year, is already fragile at best. Both sides have accused each other of repeated violations. More than 450 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli strikes since it came into force, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. The Israeli military says three of its soldiers have been killed in attacks by Palestinian armed groups during the same period. Secondly, there is little clarity over to what extent Israel will be required to withdraw its forces from Gaza. It has given no indication that it is willing to pull back completely, insisting it needs to maintain a strong security presence in Gaza. Israel officials talk of "a new reality" in Gaza, insisting that the strip will never go back to the way it was before Hamas launched its deadly attack on 7 October 2023. So, there could be continued wrangling over how far Israeli forces withdraw. Then there is the issue of governance. Who will run Gaza, if not Hamas, which came to power after winning Palestinian elections almost exactly 20 years ago? Who will provide policing, security, schools, hospitals? For more than a year now, there has been the idea that some sort of International Stabilization Force could provide security in Gaza. Egypt, Turkey, the UAE, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, as well as the West Bank-based, Palestinian Authority, have all been suggested as potential countries that would make up this force. But none have committed and, again, the detail is unclear. Anyone seen as "riding in on the back of Israeli tanks" is likely to meet a frosty reception from Palestinians in Gaza. Under Trump's peace plan, Gaza will supposedly have three levels of governance. As the lowest level, the strip will be run by a new government of technocrats made up of figures from civil society within Gaza. The names of its members were announced on Wednesday, with Hamas having agreed to have no role in the government. Above that will be an Executive Committee based outside Gaza to oversee the new government's work. It is likely to be made up of non-Palestinians, with former British prime minister Tony Blair said be among those who will sit on the committee. Blair is widely distrusted by Palestinians, being seen as too close to Israel, and for his role, alongside former US president George W Bush, in the second Iraq War launched in 2003. Finally, above the Executive Committee will be the Board of Peace, with Trump as its chairman. The current British Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, Italy's leader Giorgia Meloni, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan are rumoured to be among the board's proposed members. Many Palestinians say having foreigners in effect running Gaza smacks of colonialism. The question is: do they have a choice? And all the while, the humanitarian situation in Gaza remains utterly bleak. Since the ceasefire was announced last October, more aid has been allowed into the strip, but aid agencies say it is still nowhere near enough. Hundreds of thousands of Gazans remain homeless and are living in makeshift tents. The last few months in the region has seen grim winter weather, with torrential rain, high winds and temperatures below 5C (41F). Gaza has experienced severe flooding, with buildings collapsing and tents blown away. Most children have had little or no education for more than two years. What does the future hold for them? So, while phase two of the peace plan may seem like progress, there remain many reasons for pessimism.

Aid workers cleared of human trafficking charges in Greece A group of aid workers who were put on trial in Greece for rescuing migrants on the island of Lesbos have been acquitted of all charges. The 24 former volunteers were arrested seven years ago - accused of human trafficking and other offences - and could have faced up to 20 years in jail. They had worked for an NGO that rescued asylum-seekers at risk of drowning between 2015 to 2018, when hundreds of thousands of migrants crossed the narrow straits from Turkey to Greece. Their case was widely criticised by aid agencies and human rights campaigners as an attempt to criminalise humanitarian aid, and was seen as having profound implications for migration policy across Europe. The defendants, who worked for the Emergency Response Centre International (ERCI), included the former Syrian migrant and former competitive swimmer Sara Mardini, who returned to Lesbos to rescue other refugees, and whose story was told in the Netflix drama, The Swimmers. She and the others were arrested in 2018. They were cleared of some accusations, including espionage, in 2023, but their trial on the remaining charges of facilitating the illegal entry of foreigners into Greece, money-laundering and membership of a criminal organisation only began last month. "All defendants are acquitted of the charges" because their aim was "not to commit criminal acts but to provide humanitarian aid", presiding judge Vassilis Papathanassiou told the court on Thursday. Prosecutor Dimitris Smyrnis had earlier recommended their acquittal, emphasising that "no independent basis establishing the criminal liability of the defendants has been demonstrated". During the trial, the court heard evidence from a senior police officer testifying about the defendants' use of an encrypted messaging service, WhatsApp, to share information about the location and state of boats carrying migrants. He testified that information had not been shared with the Greek authorities. But a Greek coast guard officer, Stavros Gagarellis, gave evidence that the volunteers had cooperated closely with his organisation. The judge ruled that "a communication group on the internet cannot be regarded as a criminal organisation," saying: "Waiting to rescue a human life cannot be considered facilitation of illegal entry. "None of the defendants attempted to act in such a way as to allow any of the transported persons - refugees or otherwise - to evade inspection by the authorities," he added. Zacharias Kesses, the lawyer for Sara Mardini and another defendant, Sean Binder, said after the verdict: "I'm astonished that it took 2,889 days for the prosecutor to realise that the accusation made no sense whatsoever—something everyone except him already knew." Binder, an Irish-German lawyer who, alongside Mardini, was held in pre-trial detention for three months in 2018, said: "Right now it's a relief and anger cocktail, equally balanced. I am obviously very relieved that I'm not going back to prison. But I'm also very angry that it's taken this long to get here." Binder, now 31, has also spoken of how the allegations had affected his life: "I've spent the past seven years in limbo. I had hoped to have a job, a career, some savings by now. I'd have hoped to be able to be a father. I'm trained as a lawyer, but I wasn't allowed to represent my clients until I was acquitted." Eve Geddie of the human rights organisation Amnesty International said: "We hope today's decision sends a strong signal to Greece and other European countries that solidarity, compassion and defending human rights should be protected and celebrated, not punished." A BBC radio documentary on the case, "Assignment: Greece-Rescuers on Trial" will be broadcast on BBC World Service on Tuesday, January 20, and will available on BBC Sounds.

Boeing knew of flaw in part linked to UPS plane crash, US safety board report says An aircraft that crashed in flames in Kentucky in November had a structural flaw that had been identified by Boeing on similar planes 15 years ago, according to investigators. The MD-11F freighter operated by UPS, crashed after one of its engines separated from the wing as it was preparing to take off from Louisville. The plane briefly lifted off from the runway, before hurtling out of control into an industrial area. Fifteen people died as a result, including three crew and 12 on the ground. In an update report, the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) revealed that cracks found in the engine mounting assembly had previously occurred on several other aircraft. At the time the manufacturer responsible for the aircraft, Boeing, concluded that the issue "would not result in a safety of flight condition". The MD-11 is a relatively elderly design that was originally produced by McDonnell Douglas. Boeing acquired the company in 1997. The last MD-11 came off the production line in 2001, but Boeing has continued providing parts and service support. In the aftermath of the Kentucky disaster, the NTSB issued a preliminary report which drew attention to cracks in the engine attachment mechanism. Its latest update goes further, describing fractures due to evidence of "fatigue" – or repeated stresses - in a critical bearing, as well as the mounting it is meant to sit in. It points out that Boeing had previously found failures of the same part on four occasions, affecting three different aircraft. In 2011, the company sent a "service letter" to operators warning them of its findings. This is a non legally-binding document used to alert operators about important safety or maintenance information. In this case, Boeing recommended that the part be included in a general visual inspection every five years. It also pointed out changes to the inspection procedure contained in the aircraft maintenance manual, and drew attention to a revised bearing assembly that could be fitted – although this was not mandatory. Tim Atkinson, a former air accident investigator who now works as an aviation safety consultant, said the NTSB's update made disturbing reading. "The structure concerned is not decorative, it's an essential part of the mechanism that attaches the engine to the wing, and carries loads such as thrust and drag," he explained. "It's extraordinary that Boeing concluded that a failure of this part would not have safety consequences," he claimed. Boeing's internal processes have come under fire on a number of occasions in recent years. Criticisms have focused on how the design of its 737 Max included flawed software that was implicated in two accidents, in 2018 and 2019, that together cost 346 lives. Quality controls in its factories have also come under scrutiny, after a door panel fell off a brand new 737 Max shortly after take-off in early 2024. In a statement, Boeing said: "We continue to support the investigation led by the NTSB. Our deepest condolences go out to the families who lost loved ones and our thoughts remain with all those affected." The NTSB's investigation is continuing. It has not yet issued any firm conclusions about the cause of the accident, and is unlikely to do so until it publishes its final report.

US forces seize a sixth Venezuela-linked oil tanker in Caribbean Sea The US has seized a sixth tanker in the Caribbean Sea in its ongoing efforts to control exports of Venezuelan oil, officials say. The vessel, Veronica, was boarded in a predawn operation "without incident" as it was defying President Donald Trump's "quarantine of sanctioned vessels", said the US military. "The only oil leaving Venezuela will be oil that is coordinated properly and lawfully," the Southern Command said. Since the US military strikes on Venezuela and seizure of its president Nicolás Maduro this month, Trump has said he plans to tap into the country's huge oil reserves. "The Veronica is the latest tanker operating in defiance of President Trump's established quarantine of sanctioned vessels in the Caribbean," US Southern Command said in a post on social media. It also posted a video showing Marines and sailors boarding the tanker. Veronica, a crude oil tanker sailing under a Guyanese flag, departed empty from Venezuelan waters in early January, according to monitoring service TankerTrackers.com. The International Maritime Organization's database shows the vessel was previously registered in Russia under different names. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem posted on social media that Thursday's tanker seizure was carried out with "close coordination with our colleagues" in the military as well as the state and justice departments. "Our heroic Coast Guard men and women once again ensured a flawlessly executed operation, in accordance with international law," Noem added. It suggests Washington's crackdown on the so-called dark fleet, comprising more than 1,000 vessels that transport sanctioned oil, will continue as the US works with Venezuela's interim government to control the country's oil sales. It also comes a day after an American official said the US had completed its first sale of Venezuelan oil, valued at $500m (£373m). Trump last week asked oil executives at the White House to invest $100bn in Venezuela's energy infrastructure. They said significant changes would be needed make the country an attractive investment. The blockade has sharply curtailed Venezuelan oil exports, with only ships associated with Chevron and bound for the US operating as usual, according to Matt Smith, head of US analysis at Kpler. Loadings have fallen roughly in half this month to about 400,000 barrels per day, he said. The Veronica, a relatively small tanker with a sanctioned owner, was among about 17 ships that attempted to breach the blockade earlier this month, according to the firm. Smith said it was unclear why vessels from the so-called dark fleet would risk seizure, but noted the financial cost of delays. "If a tanker was supposed to be moving crude and can't get through, that's money lost," he said. He said the US quarantine had created a bottleneck of supply that would otherwise be headed to countries, mainly China. But as the US starts selling Venezuelan oil, he said there were signs the situation was evolving with some tankers now headed to the Bahamas for storage. The latest tanker seizure came just hours ahead of a meeting between Trump and Venezuela's opposition leader Maria Corina Machado at the White House. Trump has previously described her as a "freedom fighter", but rejected the notion of appointing her to lead Venezuela after Maduro's removal, arguing that she lacks sufficient domestic backing. He instead backed Delcy Rodríguez, Maduro's former vice-president. Trump describes Rodríguez as an "ally", and she has not been charged by US officials with any crimes. Machado is expected to use her face time with Trump to try to persuade him that his decision to back Rodríguez's interim government is a mistake, and that her opposition coalition should be in charge of this transition. A Venezuelan government envoy, too, is expected to travel to Washington on Thursday to meet US officials and take initial steps towards reopening the country's embassy, the New York Times reported. "The emissary is reported to be a close ally and friend of the interim president, Delcy Rodríguez, who has been described as "extremely co-operative" by the White House. On Thursday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the $500m energy deal was struck in large part because of help from Rodriguez. She said the interim president had also confirmed that Venezuela would be releasing political prisoners from Venezuela. "There were five Americans who were recently released this week as well," Leavitt said. "So, the president likes what he's seeing. And we'll expect that co-operation to continue."

Ethiopia says seized ammunition sent by Eritrea to rebels as tensions rise Ethiopian police say they have seized thousands of rounds of ammunition sent by Eritrea to a violent armed rebel group, stoking fears of renewed armed conflict. Eritrea has denied the allegation and accused Ethiopia of "floating false flags to justify the war that it has been itching to unleash for two long years". It comes at a volatile moment for the relationship between the Horn of Africa neighbours, which share a fractious and violent history. Hopes of tentative peace, forged during a 2020-22 civil war in northern Ethiopia, have of late given way to a war of words over control of the Red Sea. This latest claim appears to be a sign of further escalation. On Wednesday, Ethiopian police said in a Facebook statement that they had seized "more than 56,000 rounds of ammunition" in the Amhara region intended to "arm the Fano" rebels, and had arrested two suspects. "The preliminary investigation conducted on the two suspects who were caught red-handed has confirmed that the ammunition was sent by the Shabiya government" - a term for Eritrea's ruling party - they said. Eritrea's Information Minister Yemane Gebremeskel denied the claim and accused Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's Prosperity Party (PP) of seeking a pretext to attack. Relations between the two countries have frequently been strained. After a decades-long battle for independence, Eritrea, which has a 1,350km (840-mile) Red Sea coastline, officially seceded from Ethiopia in 1993, leaving it landlocked. Five years later, a border war erupted in which more than 100,000 people died. In 2018, the two nations signed an historic declaration to normalise relations. Eritrean troops then fought in support of the Ethiopia government during the civil war that broke out in Ethiopia's Tigray region. But relations soured when Eritrea was excluded from the peace deal that ended the conflict in November 2022. In the three years since, Ethiopia's government has been grappling with a violent insurgency, waged by the Fano rebels, who now control large parts of its northern Amhara region. Eritrea has previously denied meddling in Ethiopian affairs. Ethiopia's calls for access to the Red Sea through Eritrea have caused relations with Eritrea to further strrain in recent months. Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy first openly declared in 2023 that his nation's access to the sea was an existential matter, which Eritrea dismissed. In an interview earlier this week with state-run media, Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki accused Abiy's party had declaring war on his country. He said Eritrea did not want war, but added: "We know how to defend our nation." Abiy has said Ethiopia does not seek conflict with Eritrea and wants to address the issue of sea access through dialogue.

Explosion and fire in Dutch city of Utrecht caused by gas leak, officials say A fire that broke out following a large explosion at a house in the Dutch city of Utrecht was caused by a gas leak, officials say. At least four people were injured in the incident, which happened near Visscherssteeg, an alley in the city centre, on Thursday afternoon. Utrecht Mayor Sharon Dijksma said none of the injuries were life-threatening. The cause of the gas leak is unknown but it is not thought to have been caused deliberately. The blaze has since been put out but it took firefighters several hours. Large plumes of smoke were seen rising above the house, and the nearby streets were covered with rubble and glass. One eyewitness told RTL News that they had heard a "deafening bang" and that " everything in the alley was destroyed". Other people told the Volksrant newspaper that the walls and windows of several buildings were blown out, and many nearby shops were damaged. Local residents were evacuated, while members of the public were advised to stay away from the area.

**Excerpt**

Singapore's opposition leader stripped of title after conviction for lying Singapore's Leader of the Opposition in parliament, Pritam Singh, has been stripped of his title by the prime minister following a vote by lawmakers. The vote took place on Wednesday in parliament, which is overwhelmingly dominated by the ruling People's Action Party (PAP). The move follows Singh's conviction for lying under oath to a parliamentary committee. Singh has consistently maintained his innocence. He remains a member of parliament and secretary-general of the largest opposition party, Workers' Party (WP), but will lose privileges such as additional allowances and the right of first reply during parliamentary debates. Singh's case stands out as one of the only criminal convictions against a sitting opposition lawmaker. He was also the first person to hold the title of Leader of the Opposition. Critics have previously accused Singapore's government of using the judiciary to go after its political opponents - charges authorities have always denied. On Wednesday, Indranee Rajah, the Leader of the House who had initiated the debate, said that Singh's lies "strike at the trust" Singaporeans place in parliament and accused him of "failing to take responsibility". Singh defended himself during the debate, saying that his "conscience remains clear" and disagreed with the debate's resolution that his behaviour was "dishonourable and unbecoming". He also vowed to continue his work as an MP. After three hours of debate, the parliament backed a motion that agreed Singh should not be the Leader of the Opposition. All 11 present WP members voted against it. The parliament also agreed to review the implications for two other WP lawmakers at another time. On Thursday, Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said in light of Singh's conviction and the vote that it was "no longer tenable" for him to continue as the Leader of the Opposition. He also invited the WP to nominate another of their MPs to take the title. In response to BBC queries over text messaging, Singh responded with a single word: "#WeContinue". The WP said it will deliberate on the move and respond "in due course". It previously said it would conduct an internal review of whether Singh contravened their rules. The party holds 12 seats in Singapore's 108-seat parliament. What to know about Singh's case The saga began in 2021, when WP lawmaker Raeesah Khan claimed in parliament that she had witnessed police misbehave towards a sexual assault victim. She later admitted that her anecdote was not true, but said during a parliamentary committee investigation that the party's leaders, including Singh, had told her to "continue with the narrative" despite knowing about the lie. Khan has since resigned from the party and parliament, and was fined for lying and abusing her parliamentary privilege. A criminal case was subsequently brought against Singh for lying under oath to the parliamentary committee during hearings for Khan's case. Last February a court found him guilty and fined him several thousands of dollars. It ruled that Singh's actions were "strongly indicative" that he had not wanted Khan to clarify her lie. But Singh, who maintained his innocence throughout the closely-watched trial, argued that he had wanted to give Khan time to deal with what was a sensitive issue. In December he lost an appeal against the conviction.

**Excerpt**

From behind bars, Aung San Suu Kyi casts a long shadow over Myanmar As of Wednesday the Burmese democracy campaigner Aung San Suu Kyi will have spent a total of 20 years in detention in Myanmar, five of them since her government was overthrown by a military coup in February 2021. Almost nothing is known about her state of health, or the conditions she is living in, although she is presumed to be held in a military prison in the capital Nay Pyi Taw. "For all I know she could be dead," her son Kim Aris said last month, although a spokesman for the ruling military junta insisted she is in good health. She has not seen her lawyers for at least two years, nor is she known to have seen anyone else except prison personnel. After the coup she was given jail sentences totalling 27 years on what are widely viewed as fabricated charges. Yet despite her disappearance from public view, she still casts a long shadow over Myanmar. There are repeated calls for her release, along with appeals to the generals to end their ruinous campaign against the armed opposition and negotiate an end to the civil war that has now dragged on for five years. The military has tried to remove her once ubiquitous image, but you still see faded posters of "The Lady", or "Amay Su", Mother Su, as she is affectionately known, in tucked away corners. Could she still play a role in settling the conflict between the soldiers and the people of Myanmar? After all, it has happened before. Back in 2010 the military had been in power for nearly 50 years, brutally crushed all opposition and run the economy into the ground. Just as it is doing now, it organised a general election which excluded Aung San Suu Kyi's popular National League for Democracy, and which it ensured its own proxy party, the USDP, would win. As with this election, which is still under way in phases, the one in 2010 was dismissed by most countries as a sham. Yet at the end of that year Aung San Suu Kyi was released, and within 18 months she had been elected an MP. By 2015 her party had won the first free election since 1960, and she was de facto leader of the country. To the outside world it seemed an almost miraculous democratic transition, evidence perhaps that among the stony-faced generals there might be genuine reformers. So could we see a re-run of that scenario once the junta has completed its three-stage election at the end of this month? A lot has changed between then and now. Back then there had been many years of engagement between the generals and an assortment of UN envoys, exploring ways to end their pariah status and re-engage with the rest of the world. It was a more optimistic era; the generals could see their South East Asian neighbours prospering through trade with the Western world, and they wanted an end to crippling economic sanctions. They also sought better relations with the US as a counterbalance to their dependence on China, at a time when the Obama administration was making its celebrated "pivot" to Asia. The top generals were still hard-line and suspicious, but there was a group of less senior officers keen to explore a political compromise. It is not clear what finally persuaded the military leadership to open the country up, but they clearly believed their 2008 constitution, which guaranteed the armed forces one-quarter of the seats in a future parliament, would be enough, with their well-funded party, to limit Aung San Suu Kyi's influence once she was released. They badly underestimated her massive star power, and they underestimated how much their decades of misrule had alienated most of the population. In the 2015 election the USDP won just over 6% of the seats in both houses of parliament. In the next election in 2020 it expected to perform much better, after five years of an NLD administration which had started with impossibly high hopes, and had inevitably disappointed many of them. But the USDP fared even worse, winning just 5% of seats in the two houses. Even many of those who were dissatisfied with Aung San Suu Kyi's performance in government still chose hers over the military's party. This raised the possibility that she might eventually win enough support to change the constitution, and end the military's privileged position. It also ruled out the armed forces commander Min Aung Hlaing's hopes of becoming president after his retirement. He launched his coup on 1 February 2021, the day Aung San Suu Kyi was due to inaugurate her new government. This time there are no reformers in the ranks, and no hopes of the kind of compromise which restored democracy back in 2010. The shocking violence used to put down protests against the coup has driven many young Burmese to take up arms against the junta. Tens of thousands have been killed, tens of thousands of homes have been destroyed. Attitudes on both sides have hardened. The 15 years Aung San Suu Kyi was detained after 1989, under conditions of house arrest in her lakeside family home in Yangon, were very different from the conditions she is being held in today. Her dignified, non-violent resistance won her admirers across Myanmar and around the world, and during the occasional spells of freedom the military gave her she was able to give rousing speeches from her front gate, or interviews to journalists. Today she is invisible. Her long-held belief in non-violent struggle has been rejected by those who have joined the armed resistance, who argue that they must fight to end the military's role in Myanmar's political life. There is a lot more criticism of how Aung San Suu Kyi governed when she was in power than before. Her decision to lead Myanmar's defence against charges of genocide at the International Court of Justice over the military's atrocities against Muslim Rohingyas in 2017 badly tarnished her saint-like international image. It had much less resonance inside Myanmar, but many younger opposition activists are now willing to condemn how she handled the Rohingya crisis. At the age of 80, with uncertain health, it is not clear how much influence she would have, were she to be released, even if she still wants to play a central role. And yet her long struggle against military rule made her synonymous with all the hopes of a freer, more democratic future. There is simply no-one else of her stature in Myanmar, and for that reason alone, many would argue, she is probably still needed if the country is to chart a path out of its current deadlock.

**Excerpt**

'It was terrifying': Residents describe carnage after Thai train crash Residents in Thailand's Ban Thanon Khot are accustomed to the rumbling of trains – rail is a key mode of transportation connecting the remote town with major cities. But on Wednesday, the mundane rhythm ended in tragedy. "The noise was abnormally loud. A huge, crashing sound," said school volunteer Pitchaya Promenade. "I saw a blue crane sliding. It seemed stuck for a moment, and suddenly it flipped over." The construction crane had collapsed onto a moving train, killing at least 32 people and injuring 66 others. Most were students and workers travelling for school and work. Thailand's Public Health Ministry said there were still three people missing from the accident. Rescuers were still pulling bodies out of the mangled train when the BBC arrived at the scene in the evening. Parts of it were completely crushed. "If I had to describe the damage visually, it looked like a spoon scooping into a slice of cake," said Pitchaya, 32, who is trained in basic first aid and was able to attend to some of those wounded. "There was an elderly woman hanging upside down [from a carriage]... Another woman, whose right arm appeared to be broken, was holding onto her." One of the train carriages had caught fire from the collision, which further complicated rescue efforts. Emergency responders used cranes and hydraulic cutting tools to free passengers trapped in the wreckage. "People were screaming 'Help! Help!' and smoke was starting to rise," said restaurant owner Penporn Pumjantuek, who works about 100m (328 ft) from the scene. "Oil from the train was spilling everywhere." She recalls being "torn between fear and courage". "I'm still scared when I think about it" she told BBC Thai. "I still remember that moment, running in to help them, when there was no one else there yet. They were crying. It was terrifying." A one-year-old and an 85-year-old were among those injured, with seven people in critical condition, authorities said on Wednesday. Suphann Imchantrik, a local resident, was among those who helped the one-year-old. "The child was still breathing, but barely," the 52-year-old said. "I saw those dead too… lying there. There were injured people. Everything was right there. It was a heartbreaking sight." The crane involved in the accident was being used to build an overhead railway that is part of a US$5.4bn (£4bn) China-backed project to link Bangkok with southwestern China via Laos. Many questions remain unanswered. Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul has called for an investigation, while the State Railway of Thailand has said it is suing the Italian-Thai Development Company - the firm in charge of the section of the railway where the incident took place. This is the same company responsible for the construction of a Bangkok skyscraper that collapsed last March during an earthquake, when no other buildings in the city fell. Amorn Pimanmas, an engineering professor at Bangkok's Kasetsart University, believes that human, rather than natural, factors are the more likely cause of Wednesday's tragedy. Given that there were no storms, no flooding, and no significant vibration from the train passing underneath, "natural causes can almost entirely be ruled out as the origin of the incident", Amorn said. Thailand is no stranger to deadly construction accidents, due in part to weak enforcement of safety standards and regulations. In 2023, a freight train collided with a pick-up truck that was crossing railway tracks in the country's east, killing eight people and injuring four others. Meanwhile, over the past seven years, around 150 people have been killed in numerous accidents on a road improvement project from Bangkok to the south of the country.
