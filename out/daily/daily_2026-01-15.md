Astronauts splash down to Earth after medical evacuation from space station Four astronauts evacuated from the International Space Station (ISS) have landed back on Earth after their stay in space was cut short by a month due to a "serious" medical issue. The crew's captain, Nasa astronaut Mike Fincke, exited the spacecraft first, smiling and wobbling slightly on his feet before lying down on a gurney, following normal procedures. Nasa's Zena Cardman, Japan's Kimiya Yui and cosmonaut Oleg Platonov followed, waving and beaming at cameras. "It's so good to be home!", said Cardman. It is the first time astronauts have been evacuated due to a health issue since the station was put into Earth's orbit in 1998. The team, known as Crew-11, will now receive medical checks before being flown back to land after the splash down off the coast of California. In a news conference after splash-down, Nasa administrator Jared Isaacman said the sick astronaut is "fine right now" and in "good spirits". Judging by past Nasa communications about astronauts' health, it is unlikely that the identity of the crew member or details of the health issue will be released to the public. Control of the ISS has been handed over to Russian cosmonaut Sergey Kud-Sverchkov and two other crew members. The astronauts arrived on the ISS on 1 August expecting to complete a standard six and a half month stay. They were due to come home in mid-February. ut last week, a scheduled spacewalk by Fincke and Cardman was called off at the last minute. Hours later, Nasa revealed a crew member had become ill. "It's bittersweet," said Mr Fincke when he handed over the keys to the ISS to Kud-Sverchjov on Monday. In a social media post, he stressed that all crew members on board were "stable, safe, and well cared for". Orbiting Earth at an altitude of 250 miles, the International Space Station (ISS) makes 16 orbits of our planet a day, travelling at a speed of 17,500 miles per hour. It is run by five space agencies and carries out wide-ranging scientific research about space and the effects on humans, animals and plants of living in microgravity. The ISS carries some medical equipment and astronauts are trained to deal with minor medical issues, but it does not have a doctor on board. The evacuation was a serious test of Nasa's procedures for dealing with medical issues. By all accounts, it passed, although there may be questions about how well the agency could have responded if the astronaut had suffered a medical emergency. The early departure leaves the ISS with a skeleton crew of just three astronauts - Nasa's Chris Williams and cosmonauts Kud-Sverchkov and Sergei Mikaev - until another four arrive in February. "Despite all the changes and all the difficulties, we are going to do our job onboard ISS, performing all the scientific tasks, maintenance tasks here, whatever happens," Kud-Sverchkov said on Monday. He then issued his first command - a group hug. The incident is unprecedented in the history of the ISS, which has been permanently crewed for 26 years. Space missions have ended early due to health issues just twice before. In 1985, Soviet cosmonaut Vladimir Vasyutin and his colleagues returned four months ahead of schedule from a mission to the Salyut 7 space station due to a urological issue. And in 1987, a heart arrhythmia caused Soviet cosmonaut Aleksandr Laveykin to leave the Mir space station early. As more and more humans travel into space, including for tourism and a possible occupation of the Moon or even Mars, space experts say doctors will need to travel on missions.

European military personnel arrive in Greenland as Trump says US needs island A 15-strong French military contingent has arrived in Greenland's capital Nuuk, as several European states send soldiers there as part of a so-called reconnaissance mission. The deployment, which will also include personnel from Germany, Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands and the UK, comes as US President Donald Trump continues to press his claim to the Arctic island, which is a semi-autonomous part of Denmark. French President Emmanuel Macron said the initial contingent would be reinforced soon with "land, air, and sea assets". Senior diplomat Olivier Poivre d'Arvor saw the mission as sending a strong political signal: "This is a first exercise... we'll show the US that Nato is present." The movement of military personnel comes after Denmark and Greenland's foreign ministers travelled to Washington for a meeting with US Vice-President JD Vance on Wednesday. Following the meeting, Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said while the talks were constructive, there remained a "fundamental disagreement" between the two sides and later criticised Trump's bid to buy Greenland. Trump, meanwhile, doubled down on his bid to bring Greenland under US control, telling reporters in the Oval Office, "we need Greenland for national security". Although he did not rule out the use of force, he said late on Wednesday that he thought something could be worked out with Denmark. "The problem is there's not a thing that Denmark can do about it if Russia or China wants to occupy Greenland, but there's everything we can do. You found that out last week with Venezuela." Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Poland was not planning to join the European military deployment to Greenland, but warned that any US military intervention there "would be a political disaster". "A conflict or attempted annexation of the territory of a Nato member by another Nato member would be the end of the world as we know it - and which for many years guaranteed our security," he told a press conference. Russia's embassy in Belgium meanwhile expressed "serious concern" at what was unfolding in the Arctic, accusing Nato of building up a military presence there "under the false pretext of a growing threat from Moscow and Beijing". However, the European Nato deployment consists of only a few dozen personnel as part of Danish-led joint exercises called Operation Arctic Endurance. While heavy in symbolism, it was not immediately clear how long they would stay. Germany was sending an A400M transport plane to Nuuk on Thursday with a contingent of 13 soldiers, although officials said they would stay in Greenland only until Saturday. Danish defence officials said they had decided with the government of Greenland that there would be an increased military presence around Greenland in the coming period to bolster Nato's "footprint in the Arctic for the benefit of both European and transatlantic security". Macron, in his new year address to France's armed forces, said Europeans had a special responsibility to Greenland "because this territory belongs to the European Union and it's also one of our Nato allies". The US already has a military base in Greenland, currently staffed by up to 150 people, and has the option of bringing in far greater numbers under existing agreements with Copenhagen. But the Danish-led initiative is seen as signalling to the Trump administration that its European allies also have a stake in security in the Arctic and North Atlantic. Sweden's prime minister said Swedish army officers had been sent to Nuuk on Wednesday. Two Norwegian soldiers, one British military officer and a Dutch naval officer were also being sent. Downing Street said the UK shared President Trump's concern about "the security of the High North", and said the deployment involved "stepping up with stronger exercising, to deter the Russian aggression and the Chinese activity." Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said on Thursday that defence and protection of Greenland was a common concern for the entire Nato alliance. Danish Defence Minister Troels Lund Poulsen said the intention was to have a military presence "in rotation", with the aim of having a more permanent military presence on the island with foreign allies taking part in exercise and training activities. Copenhagen has disputed Trump's justification for wanting to control Greenland. Rasmussen, its foreign minister, said on Wednesday there was no "instant threat" from China or Russia that Denmark and Greenland could not accommodate, although he shared American security concerns to some extent. A Democratic-led US delegation is due to visit Denmark on Friday for talks with Danish MPs. Rasmussen spoke alongside Greenland's foreign minister after talks with Vance and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Wednesday. "The president's ambition is on the table," the Danish diplomat told Fox News. "Of course we have our red lines. This is 2026, you trade with people but you don't trade people." Greenland's Prime Minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, said this week that the territory was in the midst of a geopolitical crisis, and that if his people were asked to make a choice they would choose Denmark over the US. "Greenland does not want to be owned by the United States. Greenland does not want to be governed by the United States. Greenland does not want to be part of the United States," he stressed.

**Excerpt**

From behind bars, Aung San Suu Kyi casts a long shadow over Myanmar As of Wednesday the Burmese democracy campaigner Aung San Suu Kyi will have spent a total of 20 years in detention in Myanmar, five of them since her government was overthrown by a military coup in February 2021. Almost nothing is known about her state of health, or the conditions she is living in, although she is presumed to be held in a military prison in the capital Nay Pyi Taw. "For all I know she could be dead," her son Kim Aris said last month, although a spokesman for the ruling military junta insisted she is in good health. She has not seen her lawyers for at least two years, nor is she known to have seen anyone else except prison personnel. After the coup she was given jail sentences totalling 27 years on what are widely viewed as fabricated charges. Yet despite her disappearance from public view, she still casts a long shadow over Myanmar. There are repeated calls for her release, along with appeals to the generals to end their ruinous campaign against the armed opposition and negotiate an end to the civil war that has now dragged on for five years. The military has tried to remove her once ubiquitous image, but you still see faded posters of "The Lady", or "Amay Su", Mother Su, as she is affectionately known, in tucked away corners. Could she still play a role in settling the conflict between the soldiers and the people of Myanmar? After all, it has happened before. Back in 2010 the military had been in power for nearly 50 years, brutally crushed all opposition and run the economy into the ground. Just as it is doing now, it organised a general election which excluded Aung San Suu Kyi's popular National League for Democracy, and which it ensured its own proxy party, the USDP, would win. As with this election, which is still under way in phases, the one in 2010 was dismissed by most countries as a sham. Yet at the end of that year Aung San Suu Kyi was released, and within 18 months she had been elected an MP. By 2015 her party had won the first free election since 1960, and she was de facto leader of the country. To the outside world it seemed an almost miraculous democratic transition, evidence perhaps that among the stony-faced generals there might be genuine reformers. So could we see a re-run of that scenario once the junta has completed its three-stage election at the end of this month? A lot has changed between then and now. Back then there had been many years of engagement between the generals and an assortment of UN envoys, exploring ways to end their pariah status and re-engage with the rest of the world. It was a more optimistic era; the generals could see their South East Asian neighbours prospering through trade with the Western world, and they wanted an end to crippling economic sanctions. They also sought better relations with the US as a counterbalance to their dependence on China, at a time when the Obama administration was making its celebrated "pivot" to Asia. The top generals were still hard-line and suspicious, but there was a group of less senior officers keen to explore a political compromise. It is not clear what finally persuaded the military leadership to open the country up, but they clearly believed their 2008 constitution, which guaranteed the armed forces one-quarter of the seats in a future parliament, would be enough, with their well-funded party, to limit Aung San Suu Kyi's influence once she was released. They badly underestimated her massive star power, and they underestimated how much their decades of misrule had alienated most of the population. In the 2015 election the USDP won just over 6% of the seats in both houses of parliament. In the next election in 2020 it expected to perform much better, after five years of an NLD administration which had started with impossibly high hopes, and had inevitably disappointed many of them. But the USDP fared even worse, winning just 5% of seats in the two houses. Even many of those who were dissatisfied with Aung San Suu Kyi's performance in government still chose hers over the military's party. This raised the possibility that she might eventually win enough support to change the constitution, and end the military's privileged position. It also ruled out the armed forces commander Min Aung Hlaing's hopes of becoming president after his retirement. He launched his coup on 1 February 2021, the day Aung San Suu Kyi was due to inaugurate her new government. This time there are no reformers in the ranks, and no hopes of the kind of compromise which restored democracy back in 2010. The shocking violence used to put down protests against the coup has driven many young Burmese to take up arms against the junta. Tens of thousands have been killed, tens of thousands of homes have been destroyed. Attitudes on both sides have hardened. The 15 years Aung San Suu Kyi was detained after 1989, under conditions of house arrest in her lakeside family home in Yangon, were very different from the conditions she is being held in today. Her dignified, non-violent resistance won her admirers across Myanmar and around the world, and during the occasional spells of freedom the military gave her she was able to give rousing speeches from her front gate, or interviews to journalists. Today she is invisible. Her long-held belief in non-violent struggle has been rejected by those who have joined the armed resistance, who argue that they must fight to end the military's role in Myanmar's political life. There is a lot more criticism of how Aung San Suu Kyi governed when she was in power than before. Her decision to lead Myanmar's defence against charges of genocide at the International Court of Justice over the military's atrocities against Muslim Rohingyas in 2017 badly tarnished her saint-like international image. It had much less resonance inside Myanmar, but many younger opposition activists are now willing to condemn how she handled the Rohingya crisis. At the age of 80, with uncertain health, it is not clear how much influence she would have, were she to be released, even if she still wants to play a central role. And yet her long struggle against military rule made her synonymous with all the hopes of a freer, more democratic future. There is simply no-one else of her stature in Myanmar, and for that reason alone, many would argue, she is probably still needed if the country is to chart a path out of its current deadlock.

'It was terrifying': Residents describe carnage after Thai train crash Residents in Thailand's Ban Thanon Khot are accustomed to the rumbling of trains – rail is a key mode of transportation connecting the remote town with major cities. But on Wednesday, the mundane rhythm ended in tragedy. "The noise was abnormally loud. A huge, crashing sound," said school volunteer Pitchaya Promenade. "I saw a blue crane sliding. It seemed stuck for a moment, and suddenly it flipped over." The construction crane had collapsed onto a moving train, killing at least 32 people and injuring 66 others. Most were students and workers travelling for school and work. Thailand's Public Health Ministry said there were still three people missing from the accident. Rescuers were still pulling bodies out of the mangled train when the BBC arrived at the scene in the evening. Parts of it were completely crushed. "If I had to describe the damage visually, it looked like a spoon scooping into a slice of cake," said Pitchaya, 32, who is trained in basic first aid and was able to attend to some of those wounded. "There was an elderly woman hanging upside down [from a carriage]... Another woman, whose right arm appeared to be broken, was holding onto her." One of the train carriages had caught fire from the collision, which further complicated rescue efforts. Emergency responders used cranes and hydraulic cutting tools to free passengers trapped in the wreckage. "People were screaming 'Help! Help!' and smoke was starting to rise," said restaurant owner Penporn Pumjantuek, who works about 100m (328 ft) from the scene. "Oil from the train was spilling everywhere." She recalls being "torn between fear and courage". "I'm still scared when I think about it" she told BBC Thai. "I still remember that moment, running in to help them, when there was no one else there yet. They were crying. It was terrifying." A one-year-old and an 85-year-old were among those injured, with seven people in critical condition, authorities said on Wednesday. Suphann Imchantrik, a local resident, was among those who helped the one-year-old. "The child was still breathing, but barely," the 52-year-old said. "I saw those dead too… lying there. There were injured people. Everything was right there. It was a heartbreaking sight." The crane involved in the accident was being used to build an overhead railway that is part of a US$5.4bn (£4bn) China-backed project to link Bangkok with southwestern China via Laos. Many questions remain unanswered. Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul has called for an investigation, while the State Railway of Thailand has said it is suing the Italian-Thai Development Company - the firm in charge of the section of the railway where the incident took place. This is the same company responsible for the construction of a Bangkok skyscraper that collapsed last March during an earthquake, when no other buildings in the city fell. Amorn Pimanmas, an engineering professor at Bangkok's Kasetsart University, believes that human, rather than natural, factors are the more likely cause of Wednesday's tragedy. Given that there were no storms, no flooding, and no significant vibration from the train passing underneath, "natural causes can almost entirely be ruled out as the origin of the incident", Amorn said. Thailand is no stranger to deadly construction accidents, due in part to weak enforcement of safety standards and regulations. In 2023, a freight train collided with a pick-up truck that was crossing railway tracks in the country's east, killing eight people and injuring four others. Meanwhile, over the past seven years, around 150 people have been killed in numerous accidents on a road improvement project from Bangkok to the south of the country.

**Excerpt**

Zelensky declares energy emergency as biting cold persists Ukraine has declared a state of emergency in the country's energy sector, with a particular focus on Kyiv, as ongoing Russian strikes continue to leave thousands of residents without power. President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Moscow of deliberately exploiting the harsh winter conditions as part of its war strategy, with overnight temperatures in Kyiv recently dropping to around -20C. The declaration comes as Zelensky's US counterpart Donald Trump said he was holding up efforts to secure a peace deal to end nearly four years of war with Russia. He told the Reuters news agency on Wednesday that Ukraine "is less ready to make a deal" than Russian president Vladimir Putin. When asked why peace talks have not yet resolved the conflict, Trump responded: "Zelensky". Trump's assessment drew approval from the Kremlin on Thursday, with spokesman Dmitry Peskov telling reporters: "President Putin and the Russian side remain open [to talks]." The American and Ukrainian leaders are both expected to attend the World Economic Forum in Switzerland next week, although Trump suggested no formal plans were arranged for them to meet. In recent weeks, Russian attacks on Kyiv have left thousands of homes without regular power, heating or running water. After one particularly heavy night of missile and drone attacks last week, 70% of the capital was left without power for several hours. Following a special cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Zelensky said a round-the-clock task force would be set up to fix damage caused by Russian strikes and worsening weather conditions. He said the new measures would include procuring vital energy equipment and resources from abroad to replace damaged installations. "The First Deputy Prime Minister – Minister of Energy of Ukraine has been assigned to oversee work supporting people and communities under these conditions," he wrote on X. He also ordered an increase in the number of emergency help points around Kyiv to provide heat and power for residents, a move which could see a relaxing of current midnight curfew in the capital. Russian attacks on energy infrastructure have not been limited to the capital. Last week, Ukrainian officials said that more than one million people in south-eastern Ukraine spent hours without heating and water supplies as a result of Russian air strikes. DTEK, Ukraine's biggest private energy provider, is living in permanent crisis mode because of Russian attacks on the grid, its CEO, Maxim Timchenko, told the BBC last month. As the fourth anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion approaches, Timchenko said Russia had repeatedly targeted DTEK's energy grid with "waves of drones, cruise and ballistic missiles" and the company had found it difficult to cope. He added that the intensity of strikes had been so frequent "we just don't have time to recover". DTEK currently provides power for 5.6 million Ukrainians.

Federal agent shoots Minneapolis man in leg after shovel attack, officials say A federal officer has shot a man in the leg in the US city of Minneapolis after being attacked with a shovel as he tried to make an arrest, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) says. Tensions have been running high in the city since an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent shot dead a woman last week, sparking protests there which spread to other US cities. In a statement on X, the DHS said the latest shooting happened after a car chase involving a Venezuelan national who was in the country illegally. It ended in a crash and the driver was joined by two more people who all attacked the officer, it said. Fresh clashes broke out between protesters and law enforcement in the Hawthorne area of the city, near the scene of the incident, and city officials appealed for calm. Local media, including the Minnesota Star Tribune, reported that protesters damaged a number of vehicles that were believed to belong to the federal government. In a social media post on Thursday morning, US President Donald Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act if Minnesota officials did not act to "stop the professional agitators". This is a 200-year-old law which allows the president to use active-duty military personnel for law enforcement duties inside the US, and which Trump has previously said he might invoke elsewhere. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said the situation in the city, where a new deployment of federal agents has arrived against the wishes of local officials, was "unsustainable". Tensions over immigration enforcement have been running high in the city since the fatal shooting on 7 January of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good by an ICE agent, who was standing in front of her car as she drove forwards. The man wounded in Wednesday's shooting was taken to hospital with non-life threatening injuries and an ICE officer was also taken to hospital to be treated for injuries, the DHS said. It prompted renewed clashes between demonstrators and law enforcement, the city's police chief Brian O'Hara said, adding that his officers were hit by fireworks, ice and snowballs. Minneapolis city officials said on X: "We understand there is anger. We ask the public to remain calm." "The City of Minneapolis again demands that ICE leave the city and state immediately," they added. The DHS statement said that after the pursuit the man got out of his car and an altercation took place between him and the federal agent. It added: "While the subject and law enforcement were in a struggle on the ground, two subjects came out of a nearby apartment and also attacked the law enforcement officer with a snow shovel and broom handle. "As the officer was being ambushed and attacked by the two individuals, the original subject got loose and began striking the officer with a shovel or broom stick." The DHS statement went on to say, "fearing for his life and safety as he was being ambushed by three individuals, the officer fired defensive shots", and added that "both attackers are in custody" while the subject and agent were in hospital. Law enforcement officials who spoke to the BBC's US partner, CBS News, gave additional details of what happened in the aftermath of the shooting. They said the man hit by the bullet fled into a home and barricaded himself inside with three others. This resulted in additional agents being called to the residence, which was then breached with the help of a specialised ICE team, the officials said. All of those who were inside the home were believed to have been taken into custody. The BBC could not immediately verify details in the statements. O'Hara said the FBI was investigating the incident. Around 3,000 federal officers have been deployed to Minnesota over recent weeks. In a statement on X responding to reports of ICE shooting the man in the leg, US Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said: "Minnesota insurrection is a direct result of a FAILED governor and a TERRIBLE mayor encouraging violence against law enforcement. It's disgusting." Shortly before news of the shooting, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz urged Trump to end the "occupation" of ICE officers in the state. "Angry is not a strong enough word," Walz said in a video on social media. Officials have offered differing accounts of the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good, with the Trump administration saying the ICE agent acted in self-defence, while local officials argue the woman posed no danger. Videos of the incident show ICE agents approaching a car, which is in the middle of the street. As she attempts to drive off, one of them at the front of the vehicle points his gun at the driver and fires three shots. The FBI is also investigating that incident. Minneapolis city leaders have said Good was at the scene as a legal observer - a volunteer who monitors law enforcement activity. The Trump administration says she was impeding the work of federal agents and tried to kill one of them in an act of "domestic terrorism". An online fundraiser set up for Good's widow and family has raised more than $1.4m. Another online fundraiser for the ICE agent at the centre of the deadly confrontation has raised $740,000.

**Excerpt**

She's offered to share her Nobel with Trump. But what might Machado ask for in return? Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado may hold the Nobel Peace Prize, but she knows there is only one foreign endorsement that really matters: Donald Trump's. She will meet the US president at the White House on Thursday, after publicly offering to share her Nobel with him - a prize he has long coveted. Trump has said it would be an "honour" to accept the award, although the Norwegian Nobel Institute said legally it is not possible to transfer the prize. Previously, Trump had criticised the Nobel committee for bypassing him and giving Machado the award. Largely, he has appeared cool towards Machado, who was given the award in recognition of her long fight for democracy in Venezuela. In 2023, she won the opposition primary by a landslide, and was barred from running against Venezuela's president, Nicolás Maduro, whose re-election a year later was widely condemned as illegitimate. Yet after a US operation ousted Maduro earlier this month, Trump backed Maduro's vice-president, Delcy Rodríguez, saying Machado was "not respected" enough to lead the country. For her part, Rodríguez said at her first press conference as interim president on Wednesday that Venezuela was entering a "new political era" marked by greater tolerance for "ideological and political diversity." Machado will be hoping to use her face time with the US president on Thursday to persuade him that his decision to back Rodríguez's interim government is a mistake, and that her opposition coalition should be in charge of this transition. When BBC Mundo spoke to Machado after her most recent conversation with Trump – before the US intervened in Venezuela on 3 January – she told me that she thanked him for what he was doing "for peace, freedom, and democracy", insisting that together they would "liberate" Venezuela. But immediately after the US operation, Trump announced that he planned to "run" Venezuela himself and that he was content to keep Rodríguez's interim government in place, saying that she was "essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again". On Wednesday, Trump told reporters he had a "great conversation" with Rodríguez and praised her as being a "terrific person" following a long phone call. Could a meeting between Machado and Trump in the Oval Office change all that? Trump is famously unpredictable in his personal relationships with other politicians, but how he sees Machado's role is likely to depend less on what she says than on what Rodríguez does in the coming weeks, and whether it meets Trump's approval. While many opposition supporters were shocked when Trump sidelined Machado in favour of Rodríguez, some are now beginning to understand what may have been behind that decision. Machado is a polarising figure. Though loved by her supporters - who, among other things, admire her skill in uniting a previously fragmented opposition - she is hated by the regime and its loyalists for that very same reason. To them, she is a formidable and above all, outspoken opponent. While the government now commands only minority popular support, according to polls and analysts, it retains firm control over the state's institutions, including the military. Armed civilian groups known as colectivos, financed by the state, remain an integral part of the pro-government movement. In this political and security climate, expressing public support for Machado, or for US intervention, is fraught with risk. Even some of Maduro's opponents fear what could happen if Trump was to install an opposition leader without holding fresh elections. Venezuelans are divided on Trump's actions – even among those who opposed Maduro. While some whisper support, others take particular issue with his statements suggesting that the US could control Venezuela and its oil. The division over who should lead the country is deeper still. Many Venezuelans admire Machado and recognise her as the only opposition leader who maintained a coherent and consistent challenge to Maduro's government. Here in Caracas, some people have told the BBC that, contrary to Trump's claim, she enjoys strong support within the country. They point to her landslide victory in the opposition primary ahead of the 2024 presidential election and her ability to mobilise thousands of Venezuelans to protest when Maduro declared victory in the election, even though independently verified tallies showed the candidate backed by Machado had won. That group views Rodríguez as one of the architects of Maduro's government and its abuses. They will want Machado to press Trump at the White House on how the US plans to "run" Venezuela and to try and convince him that, while his promise to "Make Venezuela Great Again" by controlling the country's oil industry may appeal to some US Maga supporters, it does little to restore democracy. Others, however, agree with Trump and believe Rodríguez should oversee the transition. They view her as the best option to avoid the instability that could be triggered by a backlash from supporters of the current government and the colectivos. They would not welcome the opposition taking power after a US military operation in which Maduro was captured and sent to New York to face drug trafficking and arms charges. The army and the colectivos are currently unlikely to take orders from the opposition and, at least in the short term, some feel the status quo is safer. A prominent Venezuelan political analyst – who did not want to be named – told the BBC that many people believe Trump's ability to overthrow Maduro was made possible largely because of Machado's efforts to weaken the regime. "Personally, I doubt that Trump fully believes what he said. If he truly thought Machado lacked support in Venezuela, why would he host her at the White House?" he said. "More than 80% of Venezuelans want political change," he adds. "They believe the opposition are the only ones capable of overseeing a process of returning to democracy in Venezuela. "And most of those Venezuelans who want change do not believe it would happen under Delcy Rodríguez."

'I carried my wife's body for an hour and a half' - BBC hears stories of protesters killed in Iran Warning: This article contains graphic descriptions of death and injury Heading home after joining a protest in Tehran on 8 January, Reza put his arms around his wife Maryam to protect her. "Suddenly, I felt my arm go light – there was only her jacket in my hands," he told a family member, who later spoke to BBC Persian. Maryam had been fatally shot - and they had no idea where the bullet had come from. Reza carried Maryam's body for an hour and a half. Exhausted, he sat down in an alley. After a short time, the door of a nearby house opened. The people who lived there took them into their garage, brought a white sheet and wrapped Maryam's body in it. Days before Maryam headed out to the protests, she had told her children - aged seven and 14 – about what was happening in their country. "Sometimes parents go to the protests and don't come back," she said. "My blood, and yours, is no more precious than anyone else's." Reza and Maryam's names have been changed for safety reasons. Maryam is one of thousands of protesters who should have returned home but never did, as the authorities responded to the rapid spread of demonstrations across Iran with a deadly crackdown. The US-based Iranian Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) says it has been able to confirm the killing of at least 2,400 protesters, including 12 children, during the past three weeks. It is extremely difficult to determine the death toll, which is expected to rise in the coming days, because the country remains under a near-total internet blackout imposed by Iranian authorities on Thursday night. Human-rights groups have no direct access to the country and, along with other international news organisations, the BBC is unable to report on the ground. Iranian authorities have not provided a death toll but local media have reported 100 security personnel have been killed, and protesters - whom they have portrayed as "rioters and terrorists" - have set fire to dozens of mosques and banks in various cities. Demonstrations began in the capital, Tehran, on 29 December, following a sharp fall in the value of the Iranian currency against the dollar. As the protests reached dozens of other towns and cities, they turned against Iran's clerical rulers. Security forces soon launched a violent crackdown, with at least 34 protesters reported killed by 7 January, the 11th day of the unrest. However, it appears the bloodiest crackdown was last Thursday and Friday, when thousands of people took to the streets across the country and called for an end to the rule of the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. BBC Persian has received dozens of accounts from inside Iran. Defiant despite potential repercussions, the witnesses said they wanted to ensure the rest of the world knew of the violence against the protesters. "Our neighbourhood smells of blood - they killed so many," one told BBC Persian. Another recalled security forces "mostly shooting at heads and faces". The protests have spread across all 31 provinces. And the information trickling in clearly shows the scale of the killings in smaller cities and towns is just as severe as in major cities. In Tonekabon, a town of 50,000 people in the north, Sorena Golgun was killed on Friday. The 18-year-old university student was "shot in the heart" running from an ambush by security forces, according to a family member. Like Sorena, many of the other protesters killed were young and full of dreams. Robina Aminian, a 23-year-old fashion-design student who hoped to study in Milan, was shot dead in Tehran on Thursday. Her mother spent about six hours travelling from their home, in the western city of Kermanshah, to collect Robina's body from Tehran. On her way back, she held her beloved daughter in her arms. But when she arrived, the security forces made her bury the body in a remote cemetery outside the city - with no other family or friends present. Not all those killed were protesters. Navid Salehi, a 24-year-old nurse in Kermanshah, was shot multiple times leaving work on Thursday. The bodies of many protesters were sent to the Kahrizak Forensic Medical Centre, in Tehran. The scenes there were so distressing Sahanand, who did not want to give his real name, decided to travel almost 1,000km to a border area so he could send out video footage by using the mobile data networks of neighbouring countries. On Saturday, Sahanand had seen more than 2,000 bodies lying on the ground, he said. Again, the BBC has no means to confirm this. However, in two newly emerged videos from Kahrizak, BBC Verify and BBC Persian have counted at least 186 bodies in one piece of footage and at least 178 bodies in the other. The two videos probably show some of the same bodies, so we cannot be definitive, but the true figure is likely to be much higher. One young woman, speaking to BBC Persian on condition of anonymity, described last week's events as like "a war". The protesters remained "more united than ever before" but it was too much for her and this week she had fled the country - like many, gripped by fear the authorities will start a new wave of executions and prosecutions. "I'm really afraid of what might happen to those who are still in Iran," she added. Additional reporting by Farzad Seifikaran and Hasan Solhjou

### 10. [Why the UAE has incurred the wrath of Somalia](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c99k4jxz0ndo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

Why the UAE has incurred the wrath of Somalia For weeks, Somalia has been engaged in intense diplomatic efforts to rally international support after Israel recognised its breakaway region of Somaliland as an independent state. Through diplomatic outreach and high-level phone calls, Somalia's government has won the backing of key countries across Africa and the Middle East, rallying them to oppose the recognition. But one relationship has sharply deteriorated - Somalia's long-standing partnership with the United Arab Emirates (UAE). For years, the oil-rich Gulf state has been viewed as a significant player in Somalia's security, economy, and politics, as the country has a coastline of more than 3,000km (1,864 miles) along the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean - a strategic maritime region hit by piracy and weapon-smuggling that has contributed to instability in both Africa and the Middle East. The UAE cultivated multi-layered relationships with both Somalia's federal government and its regions, and has been involved in port operations in Bosaso in Puntland and Kismayo in Jubaland, as well as Berbera in Somaliland. But on Monday, Somalia's federal government announced the cancellation of all port management and security cooperation agreements with the UAE, accusing it of undermining the country's sovereignty. "We had a good relationship with the UAE, but unfortunately, they didn't engage us as an independent and sovereign nation. After a careful assessment, we were forced to take the decision that we took," Somalia's President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud said in a televised address following an extraordinary cabinet meeting. The UAE has not yet responded to his comments. Omar Mahmoud, a senior researcher at the International Crisis Group think-tank, tells the BBC that Israel's recognition of Somaliland formed the backdrop to the decision. "Somalia views this as an infringement of its territorial integrity and believes the UAE played a behind-the-scenes role in supporting the outcome," Mahmoud says. In late December, Israel became the first country in the world to recognise Somaliland's independence. This led to huge celebrations in Somaliland's capital, Hargeisa, as Israel had given the territory the recognition it had yearned for since it seceded from Somalia more than 30 years ago, forming its own government, and adopting its own passport and currency. In exchange, Somaliland said it would sign up to the 2020 Abraham Accords, which have so far seen the UAE, Bahrain and Morocco establish full diplomatic relations with Israel, giving Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government a boost at a time it has faced a backlash over the war in Gaza. "The region is increasingly defined by divergent geopolitical blocs, with the UAE and Israel on one side, and Saudi Arabia, Turkey and others on the other," Mahmoud says. On Monday, The Middle East Eye news site reported that the diplomatic fall-out has led to the UAE evacuating its security personnel and heavy military equipment from the air base in Bosaso. Mahmoud says that Somalia's relationship with the UAE has been steadily deteriorating since 2024, when Ethiopia - a major ally of the Gulf state in the Horn of Africa - signalled that it was prepared to recognise Somaliland's independence, in a trade-off that would see it establish a navel base along the breakaway state's coast. "Somali suspicion of the UAE grew following Ethiopia's 2024 memorandum of understanding with Somaliland to swap sea access for recognition, as Somalia saw the UAE as potentially supporting an agreement it strongly opposed. "But Ethiopia only promised recognition. Israel went ahead and did it, and that raises the stakes," Mahmoud adds. The analyst points out that Somalia has also accused the UAE of using its territory to help Yemeni separatist leader Aidarous al-Zubaidi leave the country, and this was likely to have been "the final straw" that led to the rupture in their relationship. "Using Somalia's airspace, Somalia's airfields to smuggle a fugitive is not something that Somalia condones," Ali Omar, Somalia's state minister for foreign affairs, told Al Jazeera. Last week, the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen made a similar accusation, alleging that al-Zubaidi, who heads Yemen's separatist Southern Transitional Council, first crossed into Berbera by ship, and was then flown by a cargo aircraft to Abu Dhabi via Mogadishu under the "supervision" of UAE officers. The UAE denies backing the separatists in Yemen. This is not the first time diplomatic relations between Somalia and the UAE have soured. In 2018, Somalia, then under President Mohamed Abdullahi Farmajo, severed ties with the UAE, accusing it of interference in Somalia's internal affairs. At the time, the current president was an opposition figure who strongly defended the UAE's involvement in Somalia, but he has now adopted a sharply different position, trying to exploit differences between the UAE and Saudi Arabia over the war in Yemen to his advantage. "Regional developments including Israel's recognition of Somaliland and shifting dynamics in Yemen involving Saudi Arabia and the Southern Transitional Council created sufficient pressure for the government to act decisively," Samira Gaid, an analyst with Balqiis Insight think-tank, tells the BBC. However, Mahmoud says Somalia's federal government lacks the capacity to enforce its decision to cancel port deals with the UAE, as it does not exercise authority over the breakaway state of Somaliland. Nor does it have much control over the ports in Puntland and Jubaland, two semi-autonomous regions within Somalia. "The Somali government has little presence on the ground in these areas and is locked into political competition with these administrations over the division of power within Somalia's federal system," Mahmoud says. The Dubai-based logistics company, DP World, appears to be unperturbed by the federal government's announcement, saying its operations at Berbera port in Somaliland will continue. "DP World remains focused on the safe, efficient operation of the port and on delivering trade facilitation and economic benefits for Somaliland and the wider Horn of Africa region," it said in a statement to Reuters, adding that questions about "political decisions, intergovernmental discussions, or diplomatic positions should be directed to the relevant authorities". Its statement came as no surprise as Somaliland said that all its agreements with the UAE "remain lawful and binding". As for Jubaland, it said it regarded the federal government decision as "null and void", while Puntland condemned it as being "inconsistent with the principles of constitutional governance". However, Mahmoud says that Somalia still has some leverage over the UAE, and its allies. "Mogadishu controls the country's airspace and can use that, alongside diplomatic pressure, to push both the UAE and the regional administrations. "Somalia is also likely to rally partners such as Turkey and Saudi Arabia in support of its position," he adds. Mahmoud does not see relations between Somalia and the UAE improving in the foreseeable future, as "trust has been lost". "It would take a great deal of diplomacy and concrete steps to mend that," he says. More about Somalia from the BBC: Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

Watch: Astronauts return to Earth after medical evacuation Four astronauts who left the International Space Station (ISS) a month early due to one of the crew members falling ill have returned to Earth on Thursday. Crew 11 disembarked the Dragon Endeavour at about 01:30 local time (09:30 GMT) after an 11 hour journey back to Earth, splashing down off the coast of California. The astronauts, Mike Fincke and Zena Cardman, Japan's Kimiya Yui and cosmonaut Oleg Platonov, arrived on the ISS on 1 August expecting to complete a standard six and a half month stay. Nasa did not disclose details of the illness due to privacy reasons. Read more on this story here.
