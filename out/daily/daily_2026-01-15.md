Trump told 'killing has stopped' in Iran after violent protest crackdown Donald Trump has said he has been told "the killing in Iran has stopped", but the US president has not ruled out military action against the country over its violent crackdown on anti-government protesters. According to human rights groups, more than 2,400 people have been killed in the recent crackdown by the Iranian authorities in response to nationwide protests. Trump's comments on Wednesday came after the US and UK both reduced the number of personnel at the Al-Udeid air base in Qatar. Officials told CBS, the BBC's US partner, that a partial American withdrawal was a "precautionary measure". Iran's airspace was closed to nearly all flights for five hours overnight, with several airlines announcing that they will reroute flights around Iran. The UK's Foreign Office has also temporarily closed the British embassy in Tehran, which will now operate remotely, a government spokesperson said. Trump had earlier threatened "very strong action" against Iran if the government executed protesters, after reports emerged that a 26-year-old man who had been arrested during the height of the demonstrations had been sentenced to death. Erfan Soltani was scheduled to be executed on Wednesday, his family had told BBC Persian. They later told the Norway-based Kurdish human rights group Hengaw that his execution had been postponed. On Thursday, Iranian state media said Soltani was arrested during the protests but denied he was sentenced to death. Speaking from the White House, Trump said his administration had been told "on good authority" that "the killing in Iran is stopping, and there's no plan for executions". When questioned by a reporter, Trump said that "very important sources on the other side" had informed him of the developments, adding that he hoped the reports were true. Iranian authorities have reportedly failed to give Soltani's family any more information about his case, citing only that he had been arrested in connection with a protest. The clothes shop owner was detained in the city of Fardis, just west of Tehran, last week. Responding to reports of potential executions, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said "hanging is out of the question" and there would be "no hanging today or tomorrow". Speaking to Fox News, he also warned the US president to "not repeat the same mistake that you did in June," adding: "If you try a failed experience, you will get the same result." In June 2025, the US bombed three of Iran's nuclear sites over fears Tehran could use them to build a nuclear weapon. Initial demonstrations over the collapse of the Iranian currency began in late December, but swiftly expanded into a wider crisis of legitimacy for Iran's clerical leadership. In addition to the temporary closure of the British embassy in Tehran, the US Mission to Saudi Arabia has advised its personnel and citizens to "exercise increased caution and limit non-essential travel to any military installations in the region". Italy and Poland have published statements urging their citizens to leave Iran, while Germany has issued a notice to air operators recommending that flights do not enter Iranian airspace, citing potential risk from "escalating conflict and anti-aviation weaponry". German airline Lufthansa issued a statement confirming its flights would avoid Iranian and Iraqi airspace "until further notice". The US embassy in Doha has advised its personnel to exercise increased caution and limit non-essential travel to the Al-Udeid air base, while the Qatari government said it would continue to "implement all necessary measures to safeguard the security and safety of its citizens and residents". Al-Udeid is the largest US military base in the Middle East with about 10,000 personnel based there, as well as around 100 UK staff. It is not clear how many will be leaving. Earlier this week, the US president had urged Iranians to "KEEP PROTESTING" via a post on his Truth Social platform, promising that "HELP IS ON ITS WAY". Trump has been reluctant to lend his support to any challengers to Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, saying that "we aren't really up to that point yet" in an interview with Reuters on Wednesday. When asked whether he could support Iranian opposition figure Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran's last shah, Trump said "I don't know whether or not his country would accept his leadership, and certainly if they would, that would be fine with me". "He seems very nice, but I don't know how he'd play within his own country," Trump added. Many Iranian demonstrators called for Pahlavi's return during the protests which began more than three weeks ago, but it is difficult to establish the extent of his backing within the country. Trump also said that the Iranian government could fall due to the protests, but added that "any regime can fail". Tehran has imposed an internet blackout on the country since last Thursday, as authorities stepped up their crackdown on anti-government demonstrations. The BBC and most other international news organisations are also unable to report from inside Iran, making obtaining and verifying information difficult. The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) said it had so far confirmed the killing of 2,435 protesters, as well as 13 children. The group said a further 882 deaths remain under investigation. Are you an Iranian in the UK? Are you struggling to speak to family in the country? Get in touch here or use the form below.

'I carried my wife's body for an hour and a half' - BBC hears stories of protesters killed in Iran Warning: This article contains graphic descriptions of death and injury Heading home after joining a protest in Tehran on 8 January, Reza put his arms around his wife Maryam to protect her. "Suddenly, I felt my arm go light – there was only her jacket in my hands," he told a family member, who later spoke to BBC Persian. Maryam had been fatally shot - and they had no idea where the bullet had come from. Reza carried Maryam's body for an hour and a half. Exhausted, he sat down in an alley. After a short time, the door of a nearby house opened. The people who lived there took them into their garage, brought a white sheet and wrapped Maryam's body in it. Days before Maryam headed out to the protests, she had told her children - aged seven and 14 – about what was happening in their country. "Sometimes parents go to the protests and don't come back," she said. "My blood, and yours, is no more precious than anyone else's." Reza and Maryam's names have been changed for safety reasons. Maryam is one of thousands of protesters who should have returned home but never did, as the authorities responded to the rapid spread of demonstrations across Iran with a deadly crackdown. The US-based Iranian Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) says it has been able to confirm the killing of at least 2,400 protesters, including 12 children, during the past three weeks. It is extremely difficult to determine the death toll, which is expected to rise in the coming days, because the country remains under a near-total internet blackout imposed by Iranian authorities on Thursday night. Human-rights groups have no direct access to the country and, along with other international news organisations, the BBC is unable to report on the ground. Iranian authorities have not provided a death toll but local media have reported 100 security personnel have been killed, and protesters - whom they have portrayed as "rioters and terrorists" - have set fire to dozens of mosques and banks in various cities. Demonstrations began in the capital, Tehran, on 29 December, following a sharp fall in the value of the Iranian currency against the dollar. As the protests reached dozens of other towns and cities, they turned against Iran's clerical rulers. Security forces soon launched a violent crackdown, with at least 34 protesters reported killed by 7 January, the 11th day of the unrest. However, it appears the bloodiest crackdown was last Thursday and Friday, when thousands of people took to the streets across the country and called for an end to the rule of the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. BBC Persian has received dozens of accounts from inside Iran. Defiant despite potential repercussions, the witnesses said they wanted to ensure the rest of the world knew of the violence against the protesters. "Our neighbourhood smells of blood - they killed so many," one told BBC Persian. Another recalled security forces "mostly shooting at heads and faces". The protests have spread across all 31 provinces. And the information trickling in clearly shows the scale of the killings in smaller cities and towns is just as severe as in major cities. In Tonekabon, a town of 50,000 people in the north, Sorena Golgun was killed on Friday. The 18-year-old university student was "shot in the heart" running from an ambush by security forces, according to a family member. Like Sorena, many of the other protesters killed were young and full of dreams. Robina Aminian, a 23-year-old fashion-design student who hoped to study in Milan, was shot dead in Tehran on Thursday. Her mother spent about six hours travelling from their home, in the western city of Kermanshah, to collect Robina's body from Tehran. On her way back, she held her beloved daughter in her arms. But when she arrived, the security forces made her bury the body in a remote cemetery outside the city - with no other family or friends present. Not all those killed were protesters. Navid Salehi, a 24-year-old nurse in Kermanshah, was shot multiple times leaving work on Thursday. The bodies of many protesters were sent to the Kahrizak Forensic Medical Centre, in Tehran. The scenes there were so distressing Sahanand, who did not want to give his real name, decided to travel almost 1,000km to a border area so he could send out video footage by using the mobile data networks of neighbouring countries. On Saturday, Sahanand had seen more than 2,000 bodies lying on the ground, he said. Again, the BBC has no means to confirm this. However, in two newly emerged videos from Kahrizak, BBC Verify and BBC Persian have counted at least 186 bodies in one piece of footage and at least 178 bodies in the other. The two videos probably show some of the same bodies, so we cannot be definitive, but the true figure is likely to be much higher. One young woman, speaking to BBC Persian on condition of anonymity, described last week's events as like "a war". The protesters remained "more united than ever before" but it was too much for her and this week she had fled the country - like many, gripped by fear the authorities will start a new wave of executions and prosecutions. "I'm really afraid of what might happen to those who are still in Iran," she added. Additional reporting by Farzad Seifikaran and Hasan Solhjou

**Excerpt**

Rift at top of the Taliban: BBC reveals clash of wills behind internet shutdown It was a piece of audio obtained by the BBC that revealed what worries the Taliban's leader most. Not an external danger, but one from within Afghanistan, which the Taliban seized control of as the previous government collapsed and the US withdrew in 2021. He warned of "insiders in the government" pitted against each other in the Islamic Emirate the Taliban set up to govern the country. In the leaked clip, the supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada can be heard giving a speech saying that internal disagreements could eventually bring them all down. "As a result of these divisions, the emirate will collapse and end," he warned. The speech, made to Taliban members at a madrassa in the southern city of Kandahar in January 2025, was more fuel to the fire of rumours which had been circulating for months - rumours of differences at the very top of the Taliban. It is a split the Taliban leadership has always denied - including when asked directly by the BBC. But the rumours prompted the BBC's Afghan service to begin a year-long investigation into the highly secretive group - conducting more than 100 interviews with current and former members of the Taliban, as well as local sources, experts and former diplomats. Because of the sensitivity over reporting this story, the BBC has agreed not to identify them for their safety. Now, for the first time, we have been able to map two distinct groups at the very top of the Taliban - each presenting competing visions for Afghanistan. One entirely loyal to Akhundzada, who, from his base in Kandahar, is driving the country towards his vision of a strict Islamic Emirate - isolated from the modern world, where religious figures loyal to him control every aspect of society. And a second, made up of powerful Taliban members largely based in the capital Kabul, advocating for an Afghanistan which - while still following a strict interpretation of Islam - engages with the outside, builds the country's economy, and even allows girls and women access to an education they are currently denied beyond primary school. One insider described it as "the Kandahar house versus Kabul". But the question was always whether the Kabul group, made up of Taliban cabinet ministers, powerful militants and influential religious scholars commanding the support of thousands of Taliban loyalists, would ever challenge the increasingly authoritarian Akhundzada in any meaningful way, as his speech suggested. After all, according to the Taliban, Akhundzada is the group's absolute ruler - a man only accountable to Allah, and not someone to be challenged. Then came a decision which would see the delicate tug of war between the most powerful men in the country escalate into a clash of wills. In late September, Akhundzada ordered the internet and phones to be shut off, severing Afghanistan from the rest of the world. Three days later the internet was back, with no explanation of why. But what had happened behind the scenes was seismic, say insiders. The Kabul group had acted against Akhundzada's order and switched the internet back on. "The Taliban, unlike every other Afghan party or faction, is remarkable for its coherence – there have been no splits, not even much dissent," explains an expert on Afghanistan, who has been studying the Taliban since they were established. "Bound into the movement's DNA is the principle of obedience to one's superiors, and ultimately to the Amir [Akhundzada]. That's what made the act of turning the internet back on, against his explicit orders, so unexpected, and so notable," the expert said. As one Taliban insider put it: this was nothing short of a rebellion. A man of faith Hibatullah Akhundzada did not begin his leadership like this. Indeed, sources say he was chosen as the Taliban's supreme leader in 2016 in part because of his approach of building consensus. Lacking battlefield experience himself, he found a deputy in Sirajuddin Haqqani - the feared militant commander, then one of the US's most wanted men with a $10m (£7.4m) bounty on his head. A second deputy was found in Yaqoob Mujahid, Taliban founder Mullah Omar's son – young, but bringing with him his Taliban bloodline, and its potential to unify the movement. The arrangement continued throughout negotiations with Washington in Doha to end the 20-year war between Taliban fighters and US-led forces. The eventual agreement, in 2020, resulted in the sudden and dramatic recapturing of the country by the Taliban, and the chaotic withdrawal of US troops in August 2021. To the outside world, they were a united front. But both deputies would find themselves quietly demoted to ministers as soon as the Taliban returned to power in August 2021, with Akhundzada now a lone power centre, insiders told the BBC. Even Abdul Ghani Baradar - the powerful and influential co-founder of the Taliban who had led negotiations with the US - found himself in the role of deputy prime minister instead of prime minister as many had expected. Instead, Akhundzada - having shunned the capital where the government sits in favour of remaining in Kandahar, a base of power for the Taliban - began surrounding himself with trusted ideologues and hardliners. Other loyalists were given control of the country's security forces, religious policies and parts of the economy. "[Akhundzada], from the outset, sought to form his own strong faction," a former Taliban member - who later served in Afghanistan's US-backed government - told the BBC. "Although he lacked the opportunity at first, once he gained power, he began doing so skilfully, expanding his circle using his authority and position." Edicts began to be announced without consultation with Kabul-based Taliban ministers, and with little regard for public promises made before they took power, on issues like allowing girls access to education. The ban on education, along with women working, remains one of the "main sources of tension" between the two groups, a letter from a UN monitoring body to the Security Council noted in December. Meanwhile, another insider told the BBC that Akhundzada, who had started out as a judge in the Taliban's Sharia courts of the 1990s, was becoming "even more rigid" in his religious beliefs. Akhundzada's ideology was already such that he not only knew but approved of his son's choice to become a suicide bomber, according to two Taliban officials after his death in 2017. And he is convinced that making the wrong decision could have implications beyond his lifetime, the BBC has been told. "Every decision he makes he says: I'm accountable to Allah, on judgement day, I will be questioned why I didn't take an action," one current Taliban government official explained. Two people who have been in meetings with Akhundzada described to the BBC how they were faced with a man who barely spoke, choosing to communicate mainly through gestures, interpreted through a team of elderly clerics in the room. In more public settings, other eyewitnesses said he obscures his face - covering his eyes with a scarf draped over his turban, and often standing at an angle when addressing an audience. Photographing or filming Akhundzada is forbidden. Only two photos of him are known to exist. Getting a meeting has also become increasingly difficult. Another Taliban member told the BBC how Akhundzada used to hold "regular consultations", but now "most Taliban ministers wait for days or weeks". Another source told the BBC the Kabul-based ministers have been told to "travel to Kandahar only if they receive an official invitation". At the same time, Akhundzada was moving key departments to Kandahar - including distribution of weapons, which had previously come under the control of his former deputies Haqqani and Yaqoob. In its December letter, the UN monitoring team noted Akhundzada's "consolidation of power has also involved a continued build-up of security forces under the direct control of Kandahar". Reports suggest Akhundzada issues direct orders all the way down to local police units - bypassing ministers in Kabul. One analyst argues the result is that "real authority has been transferred to Kandahar" - something Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid denied to the BBC. "All the ministers have their power in their ministerial framework, undertaking daily works and making decisions - all the powers are delegated to them and they carry out their duties," he said. However, "from a Sharia perspective, he [Akhundzada] has the absolute power", Mujahid added - saying "to avoid God-forbidden division, his decisions are final". Men 'who have seen the world' Among the Kabul group, unhappiness was growing and alliances were strengthening. "They [the Kabul group] are people who have seen the world," one analyst told the BBC. "Therefore, they believe that their government, in its current form, cannot last." The Kabul group want to see an Afghanistan which moves towards the model of a Gulf state. They are concerned about the concentration of power in Kandahar, the nature and enforcement of virtue laws, how the Taliban should engage with the international community and women's education and employment. But despite advocating for Afghan women to have more rights, the Kabul group is not described as moderate. Instead, insiders see them as "pragmatic", unofficially led by Baradar - the Taliban founding member who still commands great loyalty. He is also thought to be the "Abdul" referred to by Donald Trump as the "head of the Taliban" during a 2024 US presidential election campaign debate. In fact, he was the group's chief negotiator with the US. The Kabul group's shifting positions have not gone unnoticed. "We remember that they [the Taliban leaders based in Kabul] used to destroy television sets, but now they appear on TV themselves," one analyst said. They also understand the power of social media. Former deputy Yaqoob - whose father led the Taliban during its first rule, when music and television were banned - finds himself increasingly popular with young Taliban members and some ordinary Afghans, evident in gushing TikTok videos and merchandise adorned with his face. But no one has been more effective in rebranding themselves than his fellow former deputy, Sirajuddin Haqqani. His ability to evade capture as his network orchestrated some of the most lethal and sophisticated attacks in the Afghan war against US-led forces - including a 2017 truck bombing in Kabul which killed more than 90 civilians near the German embassy - elevated him to near-mythical status among supporters. During this time, only one known photograph of him existed - taken by a BBC Afghan journalist. But then, six months after the US withdrawal, Haqqani marched out in front of the world's cameras at a graduation ceremony of police officers in Kabul, his face uncovered. It was the first step towards a new image: no longer a militant, but a statesman - one with whom the New York Times would sit down in 2024 and ask: is he Afghanistan's best hope for change? Just a few months later, the FBI would quietly drop the $10m bounty on his head. Yet analysts and insiders repeatedly told the BBC that openly moving against supreme leader Akhundzada was unlikely. Arguably the most visible opposition to his edicts had been minor and limited - for example not enforcing regulations like the ban on shaving beards in regions controlled by Kabul group-aligned officials. But larger acts of rebellion have always been considered unthinkable. One former Taliban member emphasised to the BBC that "obedience to [Akhundzada] is considered mandatory". Haqqani himself, in his interview with the New York Times, played down any chance of an open split. "Unity is important for Afghanistan currently so we can have a peaceful country," he said. Instead, one analyst said, the Kabul group is choosing to send "a message to both the international community and Afghans", one which says: "We are aware of your complaints and concerns, but what can we do?" At least, that was the case before the order came to shut down the internet. A breaking point The Taliban's supreme leader is a man with a deep distrust of the internet; he believes its content to be against Islamic teachings, and is so dedicated to his belief that an aide reads out the latest news or social media posts to him each morning instead, his spokesman once explained to the BBC. The Kabul group believe that a modern country cannot survive without it. The supreme leader's internet shutdown order began in provinces controlled by Akhundzada's allies, before it was expanded to the whole country. Sources close to the Kabul group and within the Taliban government described what happened next - an almost unprecedented moment in the Taliban's history. "It surprised many members of the movement," one source said. In short, the Kabul group's most powerful ministers came together and convinced Kabul-based Prime Minister Mullah Hassan Akhund to order it switched back on. In fact, the group had already made its unhappiness with the edict known before the internet was cut across the country: the group's de-facto leader, Baradar, travelled to Kandahar to warn one of Akhundzada's most loyal governors that they needed to "wake him up" - adding they had to stop being the supreme leader's "yes" men. "You don't tell him the truth openly; whatever he says, you just implement," he was reported as saying by a Kandahar insider. His words, the source said, were dismissed. On Monday, 29 September, an order came into the telecommunications ministry directly from the supreme leader to shut everything down. "No excuses" would be accepted, a source in the ministry told the BBC. On Wednesday morning, a group of Kabul group ministers - including Baradar, Haqqani and Yaqoob - gathered at the prime minister's office, joined by the telecommunications minister. Here, they urged the Kandahar-aligned prime minister to take charge and reverse the order. According to one source, they told him the full responsibility lay with them. It worked. The internet returned. But perhaps more importantly, within those few days, it was as if what Akhundzada had hinted at in that speech months earlier had come to pass: insiders were threatening Taliban unity. But why this order? One expert points out Taliban members have been happy to follow Akhundzada despite disagreeing with edicts like the ones on girls' education. Meanwhile, many of those who had challenged him openly before had paid a price. In February 2025, the then-deputy foreign minister had to flee the country after warning publicly the leadership was straying from "the path of God" in "committing injustice against 20 million people" - a reference to the female education ban. UN monitors point to at least two others who have been arrested after questioning Akhundzada's decrees on girls' education, in July and September 2025. But there is also evidence of Akhundzada and his allies moving to keep figures like Haqqani close - despite the latter's public criticisms of the supreme leader's consolidation of power. Even so, tipping over from words into actions and so decisively disregarding an order was arguably another step all together. As one expert points out, this time it may have been worth the risk. Their positions come with power and an "ability to make money", the expert says. But both depended on the internet, now crucial to both governing and commerce. "Turning off the internet threatened their privileges in a way that keeping older girls out of education never did," the expert points out. "Maybe that's why they were 'brave' that one time." After the internet was turned back on, speculation was rife about what would happen next. A source close to the Kabul group suggested the ministers will be slowly removed or demoted. However, the Kandahar insider suggested it might be the supreme leader who backed down "because he fears such opposition". As the year drew to an end, it appeared publicly that nothing had changed. The letter to the UN Security Council noted some UN member states "have downplayed the division between leaders in Kandahar and Kabul as akin to a family dispute that would not alter the status quo; all senior leaders are invested in the success of the Taliban enterprise". Zabiullah Mujahid, the senior Taliban government spokesman, has categorically denied any split. "We will never allow ourselves to be divided," he told the BBC in early January 2026. "All officials and leadership know that a split can be harmful for all, for Afghanistan, religiously prohibited and forbidden by Allah." However, he did also acknowledge that differences in "opinion" exist among Taliban members, but equated it to "a difference of opinion in a family". Half way through December, those "differences" had appeared to surface once more. Haqqani was filmed addressing a crowd in his home province of Khost during Friday prayers, warning that anyone who "gets to power through the nation's trust, love and faith and then abandons or forgets the same nation... is not a government". The same day, Akhundzada loyalist Neda Mohammad Nadem - the higher education minister - made his own speech to graduating students at a madrassa in a neighbouring province. "Only one person leads and the rest follow orders, this is a true Islamic government," he said. "If there are too many leaders then problems will emerge and this government that we have achieved will be ruined." After the dispute over the internet, these recent comments are set against a very different backdrop to those made by Akhundzada in the leaked audio at the start of 2025. Yet whether 2026 will be the year that the Kabul group move to make meaningful change for the women and men of Afghanistan is very much still up for debate. "As ever… the question remains after apparent disagreement within the Emirate's top tier – will words ever lead to action?" says one expert. "They haven't yet."

ICE agent shoots Minneapolis man in leg after attack, officials say An Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer has shot a man in the leg in the US city of Minneapolis, where an ICE agent shot dead a woman last week. In a statement, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said federal officers initially pursued the man in a car chase because he was illegally in the US from Venezuela. The City of Minneapolis confirmed a man was shot and taken to hospital for non-life threatening injuries. An ICE officer was also taken to hospital to be treated for injuries, the DHS said. Tensions over immigration enforcement have been running high in the city since the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good by an ICE agent on 7 January. Good's death has sparked protests in Minneapolis, which have also spread to multiple other US cities. The latest shooting prompted renewed clashes between demonstrators and law enforcement, the city's police chief Brian O'Hara said, adding his officers were hit by fireworks, ice and snowballs. Minneapolis city officials said on X: "We understand there is anger. We ask the public to remain calm." "The City of Minneapolis again demands that ICE leave the city and state immediately," they added. In response to Wednesday's incident, a DHS statement said the man got out of his car and an altercation took place between him and an ICE official. It added that during the incident two other people emerged from a nearby apartment building and allegedly "attacked" the officer. "Fearing for his life and safety as he was being ambushed by three individuals, the officer fired defensive shots," the DHS statement said, adding "both attackers are in custody". The BBC could not immediately independently verify details in the statements. O'Hara said the FBI is investigating the incident. In response to the latest ICE shooting, Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey accused federal officers of "creating chaos" across the state. Around 3,000 federal officers have been deployed to Minnesota over recent weeks. Officials have offered differing accounts of the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good, with the Trump administration claiming the ICE agent was acting in self defence, while local officials say the woman posed no danger. Videos of the incident show ICE agents approaching a car, which is in the middle of the street. As it attempts to drive off, one of them at the front of the vehicle points his gun at the driver and fired three shots. The FBI is investigating the incident. Minneapolis city leaders have said Good was at the scene as a legal observer of ICE activities - a volunteer who monitors police and security forces at protests and operations. Good's mother told the Minnesota Star Tribune that her daughter was "not part of anything" that involved challenging ICE agents. But White House officials, including President Donald Trump, have said Good was not simply observing, but also interfering in the officers' work. A fundraiser set up for Good's widow and family has raised more than $1.4m. In a statement on X responding to reports of ICE shooting the man in the leg, US Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said: "Minnesota insurrection is a direct result of a FAILED governor and a TERRIBLE mayor encouraging violence against law enforcement. It's disgusting." Shortly before news of the latest shooting emerged, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz urging Trump to end the "occupation" of ICE officers in the state in a video on social media. "Angry is not a strong enough word," Walz said during his address.

**Excerpt**

Singapore's opposition leader stripped of title after conviction for lying Singapore's Leader of the Opposition in parliament, Pritam Singh, has been stripped of his title by the prime minister following a vote by lawmakers. The vote took place on Wednesday in parliament, which is overwhelmingly dominated by the ruling People's Action Party (PAP). The move follows Singh's conviction for lying under oath to a parliamentary committee. Singh has consistently maintained his innocence. He remains a member of parliament and secretary-general of the largest opposition party, Workers' Party (WP), but will lose privileges such as additional allowances and the right of first reply during parliamentary debates. Singh's case stands out as one of the only criminal convictions against a sitting opposition lawmaker. He was also the first person to hold the title of Leader of the Opposition. Critics have previously accused Singapore's government of using the judiciary to go after its political opponents - charges authorities have always denied. On Wednesday, Indranee Rajah, the Leader of the House who had initiated the debate, said that Singh's lies "strike at the trust" Singaporeans place in parliament and accused him of "failing to take responsibility". Singh defended himself during the debate, saying that his "conscience remains clear" and disagreed with the debate's resolution that his behaviour was "dishonourable and unbecoming". He also vowed to continue his work as an MP. After three hours of debate, the parliament backed a motion that agreed Singh should not be the Leader of the Opposition. All 11 present WP members voted against it. The parliament also agreed to review the implications for two other WP lawmakers at another time. On Thursday, Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said in light of Singh's conviction and the vote that it was "no longer tenable" for him to continue as the Leader of the Opposition. He also invited the WP to nominate another of their MPs to take the title. In response to BBC queries over text messaging, Singh responded with a single word: "#WeContinue". The WP said it will deliberate on the move and respond "in due course". It previously said it would conduct an internal review of whether Singh contravened their rules. The party holds 12 seats in Singapore's 108-seat parliament. What to know about Singh's case The saga began in 2021, when WP lawmaker Raeesah Khan claimed in parliament that she had witnessed police misbehave towards a sexual assault victim. She later admitted that her anecdote was not true, but said during a parliamentary committee investigation that the party's leaders, including Singh, had told her to "continue with the narrative" despite knowing about the lie. Khan has since resigned from the party and parliament, and was fined for lying and abusing her parliamentary privilege. A criminal case was subsequently brought against Singh for lying under oath to the parliamentary committee during hearings for Khan's case. Last February a court found him guilty and fined him several thousands of dollars. It ruled that Singh's actions were "strongly indicative" that he had not wanted Khan to clarify her lie. But Singh, who maintained his innocence throughout the closely-watched trial, argued that he had wanted to give Khan time to deal with what was a sensitive issue. In December he lost an appeal against the conviction.

Widespread delays hit Uganda election amid internet shutdown Polls have opened in Uganda's presidential and parliamentary elections, though voting has been disrupted by logistical delays in parts of the country amid an internet shutdown. In the morning, the BBC observed growing frustration among voters queuing at some polling stations in the capital, Kampala, where voting had yet to start. Election officials are yet to comment. The delays have been blamed on failures of biometric identification kits, which some have linked to the network outage, as well as a lack of equipment in some places. In the presidential race, Yoweri Museveni, 81, in power since 1986, is seeking a seventh successive victory as he faces a challenge from a charismatic pop star. Where voting has been taking place, there are reports that the biometric machines used to verify voters' identities are still malfunctioning in some areas. "Some biometric machines are not working. I don't know if it's the internet," a ruling party official told AFP news agency. Delays have also been caused by polling materials and equipment failing to arrive at some stations on time. "We arrived early at the polling station, but the voting equipment has not yet arrived," a voter in Kampala told state-run UBC TV. The problems appear to be affecting areas that are seen as pro-government as well as areas that are seen as pro-opposition. The presidential poll is essentially a two-horse race between Museveni and singer-turned-politician Bobi Wine, but given the president has won the six previous elections, analysts say he is likely to further extend his time in power. Wine, 43, has promised to tackle corruption and impose sweeping reforms, while Museveni argues he is the sole guarantor of stability and progress in the country. The campaign period was marred by the disruption of opposition activities - security forces have been accused of assaulting and detaining Wine's supporters. Police spokesperson Kituuma Rusoke dismissed these complaints, accusing opposition supporters, particularly those belonging to Wine's National Unity Platform (NUP) party, of being disruptive. Internet access had been suspended ahead of voting day, with Uganda's Communications Commission saying a blackout was necessary to prevent misinformation, fraud and the incitement of violence - a move condemned by the UN human rights office as "deeply worrying". The NUP has rejected this explanation, accusing the regulator of trying to stop the opposition from mobilising and sharing evidence of election fraud. The former leader of a guerrilla army, Museveni has benefitted from two constitutional amendments - removing age and term limits - that have allowed him to keep running for office. Wine, real name Robert Kyagulanyi, lost to the president in the 2021 elections. According to the electoral commission, he gained 35% of the vote compared to Museveni's 59%, although Wine dismissed the results, alleging fraud. Alongside Museveni and Wine, six other presidential candidates are on this year's ballot papers. Voters will also chose a new parliament, with 353 seats up for grabs. For many of those voting on Thursday, the economy is the key issue. The majority of the population is under 30 and although the average income is steadily rising, there are not enough jobs for all the young people looking for work. There are also concerns about poor infrastructure and disparities in access to quality education and healthcare. During the campaign period, opposition supporters have faced escalating harassment, including arrest on politically motivated charges, according to both the United Nations and Amnesty International. Wine's rallies, unlike those of Museveni, have been disrupted by security forces. Amnesty has described the use of tear gas, pepper spray, beatings and other violent acts as "a brutal campaign of repression" ahead of the vote. "Some people say if you don't declare so-and-so as president, you will see. I tell them that I am not in the business of donating votes," said Simon Byabakama, vowing that only the voters would decide who won the election. The 2021 elections were also characterised by violence - dozens of people were killed in protests and the security forces were responsible for at least some of these deaths, a BBC investigation found. Since Saturday, security has been heightened in Kampala, Uganda's capital city. Officers have been marching in formation and conducting patrols, while armoured vehicles have been stationed at various locations. Some Kampala residents have travelled to rural areas, saying they believe it is safer there during the election period. "Because Ugandan elections are often violent, I decided to re-register my polling centre in my home village," one man told the BBC. He wished to remain anonymous. "I'm glad I made that decision, because as you can see now, there is a heavy and intimidating security presence in the city. So while I will still vote in my village, I am also staying away from this security scare." Polls are due to close at 16:00 local time (13:00 GMT) on Thursday, although anyone in the queue at this time will be allowed to vote. The result of the presidential vote will be announced by the same time on Saturday, the electoral commission has said.

Denmark warns of 'fundamental disagreement' after White House talks on Greenland Denmark's foreign minister has said there is a "fundamental disagreement" with the US over Greenland after talks at the White House. Lars Lokke Rasmussen said the meeting with Vice-President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Wednesday had been "frank but constructive". But he added that US President Trump was insisting on "conquering" Greenland which was "totally unacceptable". "We made it very, very clear that this is not in the interest of [Denmark]," he said. Trump afterwards reiterated his interest in acquiring the resource-rich island, a position that has rattled allies across Europe and stoked tensions with Nato. The hour-long meeting between the US, Denmark and Greenland failed to bring a major breakthrough, although all sides agreed to set-up a high-level working group to discuss the future of the autonomous Danish territory. Rasmussen said there were "red lines" the US could not cross, and the working group would meet in the coming weeks in an effort to find a compromise. He added that Denmark and Greenland were open to the possibility of the US opening more military bases on the island. "It's productive to start discussions at a high level," he said. Rasmussen also said there was an "element of truth" in Trump's view that security should be bolstered to counter Russian and Chinese interests in the Arctic. But he said the president's comments about the presence of Russian and Chinese warships around Greenland were "not true". Despite being a sparsely populated territory, Greenland's location between North America and the Arctic makes it well placed for early warning systems in the event of missile attacks and for monitoring vessels in the region. Trump has repeatedly said acquiring it is vital to US national security. The US already has more than 100 military personnel permanently stationed at its Pituffik base in Greenland's north-western tip, a facility that has been operated by the US since World War Two. Under existing agreements with Denmark, the US has the power to bring as many troops as it wants to Greenland. After the talks on Wednesday, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Greenland Vivian Motzfeldt said the territory was open to greater co-operation with the US but also opposed a takeover. "We have shown where our limits are," Motzfeldt said. Vance and Rubio did not immediately comment after the meeting. Trump, meanwhile, told reporters in the Oval Office: "We need Greenland for national security." "The problem is there's not a thing that Denmark can do about it if Russia or China wants to occupy Greenland, but there's everything we can do," he said, adding that he does not believe the US can rely on Denmark to defend the island. The talks came as allies in Europe moved quickly to show support for Greenland. Sweden on Wednesday pledged to send armed forces to the territory at Denmark's request. Germany said in a statement provided to the BBC that it would send a "reconnaissance team" to Greenland to "explore the general conditions for possible military contributions to support Denmark in ensuring security in the region". Speaking in Sweden on Wednesday evening, the UK's Defence Secretary John Healey said after a request from Denmark, the UK would be sending one military officer as part of the reconnaissance team. France's foreign minister said the country planned to open a consulate on the island next month. French President Emmanuel Macron said his country would also participate in the reconnaissance team and that "French military elements" were already on the way to Greenland. Denmark said its military expansion in Greenland will take place "in close co-operation with allies". "Geopolitical tensions have spread to the arctic," it said in a statement. The White House talks were just the latest round of diplomatic discussions over Trump's growing interest in the territory. It is unclear whether the president is considering using military force to seize the island, and he once again declined to rule it out when asked on Wednesday. Other options reportedly under consideration include purchasing the territory - though neither Danes nor Greenlanders have said it is for sale. Since taking office, Vance has criticised Denmark's stewardship of Greenland. The vice president visited soon after taking office. Trump has argued control of the territory is critical for his planned missile defence system, Golden Dome. "It is vital for the Golden Dome that we are building," Trump said in a social media post early on Wednesday. "NATO should be leading the way for us to get it." Public opinion polls suggest a majority of Greenland residents oppose coming under US control. The island's representative to the US says the last time Greenlanders were asked if they wanted to be part of the US, in January 2025, only 6% were in favour of doing so, while 85% were against. Most Americans oppose US control of Greenland as well. A Reuters/Ipsos poll released Wednesday indicated that just 17% of Americans support the US seizing Greenland, compared to 47 percent who said they opposed Trump's push to acquire the island. The latest talks on Greenland follow US military operations in Venezuela and against ISIS targets in Syria. Trump has also threatened to take military action to stop Iran's crackdown on a growing protest movement engulfing the nation. Are you in Greenland?

### 8. [Why the UAE has incurred the wrath of Somalia](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c99k4jxz0ndo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

Why the UAE has incurred the wrath of Somalia For weeks, Somalia has been engaged in intense diplomatic efforts to rally international support after Israel recognised its breakaway region of Somaliland as an independent state. Through diplomatic outreach and high-level phone calls, Somalia's government has won the backing of many countries across Africa and the Middle East, rallying them to oppose the recognition. But one relationship has sharply deteriorated - Somalia's long-standing partnership with the United Arab Emirates (UAE). For years, the oil-rich Gulf state has been viewed as a significant player in Somalia's security, economy, and politics, as the country has a coastline of more than 3,000km (1,864 miles) along the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean - a strategic maritime region hit by piracy and weapon-smuggling that has contributed to instability in both Africa and the Middle East. The UAE cultivated multi-layered relationships with both Somalia's federal government and its regions, and has been involved in port operations in Bosaso in Puntland and Kismayo in Jubaland, as well as Berbera in Somaliland. But on Monday, Somalia's federal government announced the cancellation of all port management and security cooperation agreements with the UAE, accusing it of undermining the country's sovereignty. "We had a good relationship with the UAE, but unfortunately, they didn't engage us as an independent and sovereign nation. After a careful assessment, we were forced to take the decision that we took," Somalia's President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud said in a televised address following an extraordinary cabinet meeting. The UAE has not yet responded to his comments. Omar Mahmoud, a senior researcher at the International Crisis Group think-tank, tells the BBC that Israel's recognition of Somaliland formed the backdrop to the decision. "Somalia views this as an infringement of its territorial integrity and believes the UAE played a behind-the-scenes role in supporting the outcome," Mahmoud says. In late December, Israel became the first country in the world to recognise Somaliland's independence. This led to huge celebrations in Somaliland's capital, Hargeisa, as Israel had given the territory the recognition it had yearned for since it seceded from Somalia more than 30 years ago, forming its own government, and adopting its own passport and currency. In exchange, Somaliland said it would sign up to the 2020 Abraham Accords, which have so far seen the UAE, Bahrain and Morocco establish full diplomatic relations with Israel, giving Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government a boost at a time it has faced a backlash over the war in Gaza. "The region is increasingly defined by divergent geopolitical blocs, with the UAE and Israel on one side, and Saudi Arabia, Turkey and others on the other," Mahmoud says. On Monday, The Middle East Eye news site reported that the diplomatic fall-out has led to the UAE evacuating its security personnel and heavy military equipment from the air base in Bosaso. Mahmoud says that Somalia's relationship with the UAE has been steadily deteriorating since 2024, when Ethiopia - a major ally of the Gulf state in the Horn of Africa - signalled that it was prepared to recognise Somaliland's independence, in a trade-off that would see it establish a navel base along the breakaway state's coast. "Somali suspicion of the UAE grew following Ethiopia's 2024 memorandum of understanding with Somaliland to swap sea access for recognition, as Somalia saw the UAE as potentially supporting an agreement it strongly opposed. "But Ethiopia only promised recognition. Israel went ahead and did it, and that raises the stakes," Mahmoud adds. The analyst points out that Somalia has also accused the UAE of using its territory to help Yemeni separatist leader Aidarous al-Zubaidi leave the country, and this was likely to have been "the final straw" that led to the rupture in their relationship. "Using Somalia's airspace, Somalia's airfields to smuggle a fugitive is not something that Somalia condones," Ali Omar, Somalia's state minister for foreign affairs, told Al Jazeera. Last week, the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen made a similar accusation, alleging that al-Zubaidi, who heads Yemen's separatist Southern Transitional Council, first crossed into Berbera by ship, and was then flown by a cargo aircraft to Abu Dhabi via Mogadishu under the "supervision" of UAE officers. The UAE denies backing the separatists in Yemen. This is not the first time diplomatic relations between Somalia and the UAE have soured. In 2018, Somalia, then under President Mohamed Abdullahi Farmajo, severed ties with the UAE, accusing it of interference in Somalia's internal affairs. At the time, the current president was an opposition figure who strongly defended the UAE's involvement in Somalia, but he has now adopted a sharply different position, trying to exploit differences between the UAE and Saudi Arabia over the war in Yemen to his advantage. "Regional developments including Israel's recognition of Somaliland and shifting dynamics in Yemen involving Saudi Arabia and the Southern Transitional Council created sufficient pressure for the government to act decisively," Samira Gaid, an analyst with Balqiis Insight think-tank, tells the BBC. However, Mahmoud says Somalia's federal government lacks the capacity to enforce its decision to cancel port deals with the UAE, as it does not exercise authority over the breakaway state of Somaliland. Nor does it have much control over the ports in Puntland and Jubaland, two semi-autonomous regions within Somalia. "The Somali government has little presence on the ground in these areas and is locked into political competition with these administrations over the division of power within Somalia's federal system," Mahmoud says. The Dubai-based logistics company, DP World, appears to be unperturbed by the federal government's announcement, saying its operations at Berbera port in Somaliland will continue. "DP World remains focused on the safe, efficient operation of the port and on delivering trade facilitation and economic benefits for Somaliland and the wider Horn of Africa region," it said in a statement to Reuters, adding that questions about "political decisions, intergovernmental discussions, or diplomatic positions should be directed to the relevant authorities". Its statement came as no surprise as Somaliland said that all its agreements with the UAE "remain lawful and binding". As for Jubaland, it said it regarded the federal government decision as "null and void", while Puntland condemned it as being "inconsistent with the principles of constitutional governance". However, Mahmoud says that Somalia still has some leverage over the UAE, and its allies. "Mogadishu controls the country's airspace and can use that, alongside diplomatic pressure, to push both the UAE and the regional administrations. "Somalia is also likely to rally partners such as Turkey and Saudi Arabia in support of its position," he adds. Mahmoud does not see relations between Somalia and the UAE improving in the foreseeable future, as "trust has been lost". "It would take a great deal of diplomacy and concrete steps to mend that," he says. More about Somalia from the BBC: Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

**Excerpt**

'It was terrifying': Residents describe carnage after Thai train crash Residents in Thailand's Ban Thanon Khot are accustomed to the rumbling of trains – rail is a key mode of transportation connecting the remote town with major cities. But on Wednesday, the mundane rhythm ended in tragedy. "The noise was abnormally loud. A huge, crashing sound," said school volunteer Pitchaya Promenade. "I saw a blue crane sliding. It seemed stuck for a moment, and suddenly it flipped over." The construction crane had collapsed onto a moving train, killing at least 32 people and injuring 66 others. Most were students and workers travelling for school and work. Thailand's Public Health Ministry said there were still three people missing from the accident. Rescuers were still pulling bodies out of the mangled train when the BBC arrived at the scene in the evening. Parts of it were completely crushed. "If I had to describe the damage visually, it looked like a spoon scooping into a slice of cake," said Pitchaya, 32, who is trained in basic first aid and was able to attend to some of those wounded. "There was an elderly woman hanging upside down [from a carriage]... Another woman, whose right arm appeared to be broken, was holding onto her." One of the train carriages had caught fire from the collision, which further complicated rescue efforts. Emergency responders used cranes and hydraulic cutting tools to free passengers trapped in the wreckage. "People were screaming 'Help! Help!' and smoke was starting to rise," said restaurant owner Penporn Pumjantuek, who works about 100m (328 ft) from the scene. "Oil from the train was spilling everywhere." She recalls being "torn between fear and courage". "I'm still scared when I think about it<" she told BBC Thai. "I still remember that moment, running in to help them, when there was no one else there yet. They were crying. It was terrifying." A one-year-old and an 85-year-old were among those injured, with seven people in critical condition, authorities said on Wednesday. Suphann Imchantrik, a local resident, was among those who helped the one-year-old. "The child was still breathing, but barely," the 52-year-old said. "I saw those dead too… lying there. There were injured people. Everything was right there. It was a heartbreaking sight." The crane involved in the accident was being used to build an overhead railway that is part of a US$5.4bn (£4bn) China-backed project to link Bangkok with southwestern China via Laos. Many questions remain unanswered. Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul has called for an investigation, while the State Railway of Thailand has said it is suing the Italian-Thai Development Company - the firm in charge of the section of the railway where the incident took place. This is the same company responsible for the construction of a Bangkok skyscraper that collapsed last March during an earthquake, when no other buildings in the city fell. Amorn Pimanmas, an engineering professor at Bangkok's Kasetsart University, believes that human, rather than natural, factors are the more likely cause of Wednesday's tragedy. Given that there were no storms, no flooding, and no significant vibration from the train passing underneath, "natural causes can almost entirely be ruled out as the origin of the incident", Amorn said. Thailand is no stranger to deadly construction accidents, due in part to weak enforcement of safety standards and regulations. In 2023, a freight train collided with a pick-up truck that was crossing railway tracks in the country's east, killing eight people and injuring four others. Meanwhile, over the past seven years, around 150 people have been killed in numerous accidents on a road improvement project from Bangkok to the south of the country.

**Excerpt**

US launches phase two of Gaza peace plan with new technocratic government US envoy Steve Witkoff has announced the start of phase two of President Donald Trump's plan to end the war in Gaza, with a technocratic Palestinian government established in the territory. Under phase one, Hamas and Israel agreed a ceasefire in October, as well as a hostage-prisoner exchange, a partial Israeli withdrawal, and an aid surge. Witkoff said phase two would also see the reconstruction and full demilitarisation of Gaza, including the disarmament of Hamas and other Palestinian groups. "The US expects Hamas to comply fully with its obligations," he warned, noting these include the return of the body of the last dead Israeli hostage. "Failure to do so will bring serious consequences." However, two key points of phase two could be problematic. Hamas has previously refused to give up its weapons without the creation of an independent Palestinian state, and Israel has not committed to fully withdrawing from Gaza. The ceasefire is also fragile at best, with both sides accusing each other of repeated violations. Almost 450 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli strikes since it came into force, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. And humanitarian conditions in the territory remain dire, according to the UN, which has stressed the need for the unrestricted flow of critical supplies. In his statement, Witkoff declared that with the launch of phase two of Trump's 20-point peace plan on Wednesday, Gaza was "moving from ceasefire to demilitarisation, technocratic governance, and reconstruction". "Phase Two establishes a transitional technocratic Palestinian administration in Gaza, the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG), and begins the full demilitarization and reconstruction of Gaza, primarily the disarmament of all unauthorized personnel," he said. Following the announcement, regional mediators Egypt, Qatar and Turkey welcomed the formation of what they called the "Palestinian Technocratic Committee to Administer the Gaza Strip", saying it would contribute to "efforts aimed at consolidating stability and improving the humanitarian situation". They also revealed that the 15-member committee would be headed by Ali Shaath, a former deputy planning minister in the Palestinian Authority (PA), which governs parts of the occupied West Bank not under Israeli control. Gaza's transitional administration will operate under the supervision of a "Board of Peace", which will be chaired by Trump, according to the 20-point plan he unveiled three months ago. Announcements related to the board are expected in the coming days, including when the president visits the World Economic Forum in Davos next week. Nickolay Mladenov, a Bulgarian politician and former UN Middle East envoy, is set to be the board's representative on the ground in Gaza. Trump's plan says an International Stabilisation Force (ISF) will also be deployed to Gaza to train and support vetted Palestinian police forces. Earlier on Wednesday, Hamas and its ally Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) said in a joint statement that they had agreed to support the efforts to form the technocratic Palestinian government "while providing the appropriate environment" for it to begin work. The PA - which is dominated by Fatah, Hamas's rival - also expressed support. Vice-President Hussein al-Sheikh said Trump's leadership urged all Palestinian factions, institutions and segments of society to "ensure the success of this critical transitional phase". He also stressed the importance of linking institutions in the West Bank and Gaza in order to uphold "the principle of one system, one law, and one legitimate weapon". According to Trump's plan, the PA will take over governing Gaza once it has completed reforms and can do so "securely and effectively". Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said he had spoken on Wednesday evening with the parents of Ran Gvili, the last dead hostage in Gaza. He made it clear to Itzik and Talik Gvili that "Ran's return is a top priority and that the declaratory move regarding the establishment of a technocratic committee will not affect the efforts to return Ran for a Jewish burial", the office added. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum insisted: "There is no phase 2 while Ran Gvili in Gaza. Phase Rani must come first." The Israeli government had accused Hamas of deliberately delaying the recovery of the 24-year-old police officer's remains and said it will not reopen the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt – one of its obligations under phase one - until they are handed over. Gvili was among the 251 people abducted during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, when about 1,200 other people were killed. Israel responded to the attack by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 71,430 people have been killed, according to the territory's health ministry.

**Excerpt**

X to stop Grok AI from undressing images of real people after backlash Elon Musk's AI model Grok will no longer be able to edit photos of real people to show them in revealing clothing in jurisdictions where it is illegal, after widespread concern over sexualised AI deepfakes. "We have implemented technological measures to prevent the Grok account from allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing," reads an announcement on X. Reacting to the ban, the UK government claimed "vindication" after Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer called on X to control its AI tool. A spokesperson for UK regulator Ofcom said it was a "welcome development" - but added its investigation into whether the platform had broken UK laws "remains ongoing". "We are working round the clock to progress this and get answers into what went wrong and what's being done to fix it," they said. X's change was announced hours after California's top prosecutor said the state was probing the spread of sexualised AI deepfakes, including of children, generated by the AI model. "We now geoblock the ability of all users to generate images of real people in bikinis, underwear, and similar attire via the Grok account and in Grok in X in those jurisdictions where it's illegal," it said in a statement on Wednesday. It also reiterated that only paid users will be able to edit images using Grok on its platform. This will add an extra layer of protection by helping to ensure that those who try and abuse Grok to violate the law or X's policies are held accountable, according to the statement. With NSFW (not safe for work) settings enabled, Grok is supposed to allow "upper body nudity of imaginary adult humans (not real ones)" consistent with what can be seen in R-rated films, Musk wrote online on Wednesday. "That is the de facto standard in America. This will vary in other regions according to the laws on a country by country basis," said the tech multi-billionaire. Musk had earlier defended X, posting that critics "just want to suppress free speech" along with two AI-generated images of UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer in a bikini. In recent days, leaders around the world have criticised Grok's image editing feature. Over the weekend, Malaysia and Indonesia became the first countries to ban the Grok AI tool after users said photos had been altered to create explicit images without consent. Ofcom said on Monday it would investigate whether X had failed to comply with UK law over the sexual images. If found to have broken the law, Ofcom could issue X with a fine of up to 10% of its worldwide revenue or £18 million, whichever is greater. And if X does not comply, Ofcom could seek a court order to force internet service providers to block access to the site in the UK altogether. Sir Keir warned X could lose the "right to self regulate" amid a backlash over the AI images, but later in the week said he welcomed reports that X was taking action to address the issue. The prime minister said he would "take the necessary measures" and strengthen legislation if X failed to act. He had previously condemned the images created by the tool as "disgusting and shameful", and said the decision to "turn this into a premium service is horrific". X later said the changes to Grok would apply to "all users, including paid subscribers". California Attorney General Rob Bonta said on Wednesday: "This material, which depicts women and children in nude and sexually explicit situations, has been used to harass people across the internet." Policy researcher Riana Pfefferkorn said she is surprised X took so long to deploy the new Grok safeguards and that the editing features should have been removed as soon as the abuse began. Questions remain on how X will enforce its new policies, such as how the AI model will know if an image is of a real person and what actions it will take when users break the rules, said Pfefferkorn. Musk has not presented the company in a serious light either, she said, adding that it would help if he stopped "doing things like re-posting an AI image of Keir Starmer in a bikini."

Labubu toy manufacturer exploited workers, labour group claims A labour rights organisation claims it has found evidence of worker exploitation in a Chinese factory that makes the viral Labubu dolls. China Labor Watch (CLW), a US-based non-governmental organisation, alleges that its investigation found that one of Pop Mart's suppliers made employees work excessive overtime shifts, sign blank or incomplete contracts and did not give them paid leave. The furry Labubu dolls have surged in popularity around the world in recent years and are best known for selling toys in "blind boxes", which hide its content from buyers until it is opened. Pop Mart told the BBC that it is investigating the claims. The Beijing-based toy retailer said it appreciated the details from the review and that it will "firmly" require companies making its toys to correct their practices if the allegations are found to be true. Pop Mart added that it conducts regular audits of its suppliers, including yearly independent third-party reviews carried out by internationally recognised inspectors. CLW said in its report that it had carried out the in-depth probe into Labubu-maker, Shunjia Toys Co Ltd, in the southern Chinese province Guangdong. The BBC has been unable to contact Shunjia Toys Co Ltd for comment. CLW said its researchers conducted 51 in-person interviews with the factory's employees to discuss matters of recruitment, contracts and their working conditions. The factory is a "core manufacturing facility" of Pop Mart toys and employed more than 4,500 workers, according to CLW. The organisation flagged labour issues at Shunjia Toys Co Ltd's factory in Xinfeng County, including what it said were illegal overtime hours, unclear contract practices and a lack of safety training and protections. No child labour was identified at the factory, but it had employed 16-year-old workers who were subject to the same working conditions as adults, without special care that is required under Chinese law, said CLW. It urged Pop Mart to take "immediate action" to address the issues in its supply chain. The non-profit said the firm should compensate affected workers and ensure that its production line complies with Chinese labour laws and internationally recognised labour standards. Such facilities, called original equipment manufacturers (OEM), make products according to pricing and production schedules set by the client. "As a result, labour conditions in OEM facilities are closely shaped by brand sourcing practices," said CLW. Labubus - the fictional elf-like creatures with a row of jagged teeth have become hugely popular. The craze has sparked long queues in shops worldwide. Celebrity endorsements from the likes of Kim Kardashian and Lisa from K-pop group Blackpink have helped Pop Mart to become a major toy retailer.
