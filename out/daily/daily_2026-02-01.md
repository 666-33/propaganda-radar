**Excerpt**

Rape trial puts Norway's royal family in unwelcome glare of public When Marius Borg Høiby stands up in room 250 at Oslo district court on Tuesday, at the start of Norway's biggest trial in years, he will have no moral support from his closest relatives. His mother Crown Princess Mette-Marit will not be there, nor will the man she married when her son was four - the heir to the Norwegian throne, Crown Prince Haakon. For the next seven weeks there will be no pictures of the blond 29-year-old either inside the court or outside - the court has banned them - but the world's press is here in numbers and the palace is keeping well away. Høiby is accused of 38 charges, including the rape of four women, assaulting and threatening a girlfriend and damaging her flat, as well as drugs charges and driving offences. If found guilty he could face more than 10 years in jail. The palace stresses Marius Borg Høiby is not part of the royal family, and that he is not a public figure. But he is considered a close member of the family, by his stepfather the crown prince who sees him as a son, and by Norway's much loved King Harald V, 88, who he has known for much of his life as his grandfather. "It's a very dangerous moment, because the royal family should be role models," says Ulf Andre Andersen, who broke the story for celebrity-focused magazine Se og Hør [See and Hear] in early August 2024 when police were called to a woman's flat in Frogner on the west side of Oslo after reports of a violent incident. Marius Borg Høiby has admitted some of the lesser offences, and after his arrest admitted physical abuse and destroying objects. The indictment alleges he tore down a chandelier, threw a knife at the wall and shattered a mirror, calling the woman words such as whore. The four rape charges date from 2018, at his parents' official residence, the Skaugum estate outside Oslo, to November 2024, after his initial arrest. One of the four, dating back to 2023, involves intercourse while the woman was asleep. The other three also involve sexual assault while the women were incapacitated, which also counts as rape in Norway. "This is the biggest scandal the Norwegian royals ever had," says Andersen's colleague and current Se og Hør editor-in-chief Niklas Kokkinn-Thoresen, who covered the arrest with him at the time. "They've never had to deal with anything of this measure." Known to Norwegians since his mother married into the royal family, Marius has admitted to years of struggles with substance abuse and spoken of "several mental illnesses" since childhood. Approached for comment by the BBC, his lawyers pointed to a previous statement by defence counsel Petar Sekulic: "Høiby is absolutely taking the accusations very seriously, but doesn't acknowledge any wrongdoing in most of the cases – especially the cases regarding sexual abuse and violence." Evidence will emerge from a number of women, not just those he is alleged to have raped. Only one can be identified. Former girlfriend and social influencer Nora Haukland had sought anonymity, but the courts rejected her appeal. The allegations she made in public after his arrest form part of the indictment against him, that he punched her in face, kicked her and choked her, shouting at her that she was a "whore". These are among the very serious charges denied by his defence - as is a charge of transporting 3.5kg of marijuana that was added only last month. But it is the rape and sexual assault allegations that will be the focus of much of the case, and the testimony of the women involved. "A few of the victims in the court case are well known influencers, but most of them are just regular girls who now will have to endure several weeks of having their most intimate experiences investigated in front of hundreds of journalists," says journalist Torgeir Krokfjord who co-wrote a book about Marius Borg Høiby's alleged links to the drugs world. "Just imagine how painful this will be for them." An emotional Crown Prince Haakon addressed the women and their families when he spoke to reporters ahead of his stepson's trial. "We love him, of course, he's an important part of our family," he said, before going on to address the women directly: "We care about them. We know many of you are going through a difficult time right now." Prince Haakon is next in line to the throne. King Harald and Queen Sonja are both 88 and they too will not attend the trial. During the week they will travel to Italy for the start of the Winter Olympics, visiting Norwegian athletes. Crown Princess Mette-Marit meanwhile is very unwell with pulmonary fibrosis, and her doctors are preparing her for a lung transplant. Her illness can be fatal and I understand that, for the royal family, Mette-Marit's health overshadows everything. She appeared in public last week with Crown Prince Haakon, and while she looked fine she has difficulty in breathing. She spoke very personally about her son's problems during a documentary on public broadcaster NRK over Christmas: "What I'm perhaps most upset about is being criticised for how we've handled it as parents. That we haven't taken it seriously, I find that difficult. To be so harshly criticised in a situation where we've tried to do the best we can and sought professional help… so it feels a bit unfair". Norway's royal house has long been known for its openness and there is no big gated courtyard in front of the palace. Norwegians never did put their royals on a pedestal, but the succession of scandals has made them more critical of the family. Tove Taalesen, who is royal correspondent for the Nettavisen website and worked inside the palace for a number of years, believes the crown prince made a big mistake in failing to make his stepson's role clear when he married Mette-Marit in August 2001 and showed the four-year-old to a captive audience from the palace balcony. "He lifted up this sweet, innocent little boy and presented him to the Norwegian people. He was a stepdad and he wanted to include Marius, but at the same time they didn't give Marius any title, any purpose, so he had this odd function in the family - he was a big part of it, but he wasn't a part of it." The royal house has also had to deal with the fallout of another royal wedding, involving Crown Prince Haakon's elder sister, Princess Märtha Louise, to an American shaman, Durek Verrett, not long after Marius Borg Høiby's arrest in August 2024. Märtha Louise agreed to drop her title of princess for business activities over claims that they had used it for commercial gain, but then upset the palace last autumn by taking part in a Netflix documentary on their wedding. And the negative stories keep coming. Among the three million files released on Friday night relating to late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, several hundred mentioned Crown Princess Mette Marit. It has emerged that the crown princess stayed at his house in Palm Beach, Miami, for four nights in January 2013 while he was not there, and that in October 2012 Epstein raised the issue of "wife hunting". In other emails from the HRH Crown Princess account, Epstein is told "you tickle my brain", and he is asked "what do you have to do besides seeing me?" The palace told the BBC that Princess Mette-Marit had always been open about meeting Epstein between 2011 and 2013 and she has released a statement expressing "deep sympathy and solidarity" with Epstein's victims as well as her "poor judgement and regret… it is simply embarrassing". The monarchy is widely respected in Norway - especially because of the popularity of King Harald V, and the recent setbacks do not appear to have caused any lasting damage so far. It still has the support of 73% of the public, according to a survey late last year by pollster Norstat, which suggests most Norwegians are prepared to separate the trial from their overall view of the family. But the royals know they cannot afford to be complacent. Last week, Marius Borg Høiby's sister, Princess Ingrid Alexandra, made a much-publicised visit to the Finnmark area of northern Norway. Although the palace describes her tour before the trial as long-planned and unrelated, some royal watchers here believe it was not a coincidence. She is after all in line to be Norway's queen. Every four years Norway's parliament, the Storting, holds a vote on replacing the monarchy, which by coincidence comes up again on Tuesday, just as the trial at Oslo district court is getting under way. No-one expects it to succeed.

**Excerpt**

Pakistan military says it has killed 92 militants in Balochistan Pakistan' military says it has killed at least 92 militants blamed for deadly co-ordinated attacks in the south-western Balochistan province on Saturday. The military said 15 security service personnel and 18 civilians were also killed. It accused India of supporting the militants. Delhi has repeatedly denied such accusations. The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) rebel group had earlier claimed responsibility for the attacks, saying dozens of soldiers were killed. The claims by both sides have not been independently verified. The escalation is one of the deadliest days of violence in the impoverished province, where Pakistan's government has been battling an ethnic insurgency for decades. In a statement late on Saturday, Pakistan's military blamed the militants for carrying out multiple attacks targeting civilians around the provincial capital Quetta and other cities. The military said it responded by launching "clearance" operations across Balochistan and "successfully thwarted the evil design" of the rebels. Some key administrative buildings in Quetta and roads around them were reported to have been sealed off during the day. Mobile phone services were jammed, and regional train services were suspended as a precaution. Prime Minister Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif later praised the military, pledging to "continue the war against terrorism until its complete eradication". Earlier on Saturday, militants armed with grenades and guns attacked 12 cities and towns across the province, targeting police and paramilitary installations, as well as prison and government buildings. The BLA accuses the federal government of exploiting rich mineral resources of Pakistan's largest province without benefiting the local population. Local activists also blame Pakistani security forces for enforced disappearances - Islamabad denies the allegations. Resistance against the Pakistani government and the militant insurgency advocating for an independent state for the Baloch people began in 1948, after Pakistan's independence from the British Indian Empire. Sharing a volatile border with Iran and Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, Balochistan also boasts a vast coastline along the Arabian Sea. The region derives its name from the Baloch tribe, which has resided here for centuries. Balochs remain the largest ethnic group, followed by the Pashtuns. The largest part of Balochistan is in south-western Pakistan. The Pakistani province covers nearly 44% of the country's total land but is home to about 5% of the country's more than 240 million people. Balochistan is also the richest Pakistani province in terms of natural resources, including gas and minerals.

### 3. [After ICE raids... a once bustling Chicago neighbourhood has changed](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cql4e439g4no?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

After ICE raids... a once bustling Chicago neighbourhood has changed For weeks, all eyes have been on Minneapolis where the anger at the killing of two US citizens by federal immigration agents has turned the Midwestern city into a sea of unrest. President Donald Trump has pledged to "de-escalate" the situation and the new man in charge on the ground, Tom Homan, said on Thursday there will eventually be a "drawdown" in numbers. A few hundred miles away, Chicago has already seen a surge of immigration agents, and a crackdown on its streets, ease off somewhat. Operation Midway Blitz was launched in September with the aim, it said, of targeting "criminal illegal aliens" and it peaked in the weeks that followed. Since then, Chicago and specifically its Hispanic neighbourhoods have had to adjust to a new normal. In Little Village - often referred to as the "Mexican Magnificent Mile" - the fear of raids has caused people to stay indoors, turning one of Chicago's key economic hubs into something resembling a ghost town, business owners and city officials say. "Business has dropped half during the week, sometimes even more than that. People don't want to spend money," says Carlos Macias, who owns the grocery store and restaurant Carniceria y Taqueria Aguascalientes, which his father opened 50 years ago on 26th Street, the main thoroughfare. Macias remembers how a raid on his own store spread fear in the community. The agents wore balaclavas partially covering their faces, he says, and some carried rifles while others had handguns in their holsters. As they moved through the space, they scanned the room, making eye contact with employees and customers. Some people ducked under tables, he recalls, and some began to cry. Others ran towards the back of the building, unsure of the men's intentions. As the tension rose, Macias stepped in. "This is my property," Macias told them. "You're not allowed in here." His words had little effect. The incident is still etched in his brain, and one of the reasons he believes that business has slowed. But while raids may be keeping people at home, Trump says they are necessary to protect American citizens. The Department of Homeland Security says it launched Operation Midway Blitz in honour of Katie Abraham, a 20-year-old US student who was killed in a drunk-driving hit-and-run by an illegal immigrant from Guatemala. The agency says more than 800 undocumented migrants have been arrested, including sex offenders, burglars, murderers and gang members. The downturn in Little Village is having ripple effects on the wider economy of the city, officials say. The two-mile corridor is one of Chicago's key economic hubs, generating some of the city's highest tax revenues outside the downtown Magnificent Mile. And unlike the posh boutiques and flagship international stores that dot that premier North Michigan Avenue address, this street runs through a predominantly Hispanic neighbourhood. Businesses are locally owned and cater largely to the Latino community - a customer base many say is now staying home out of fear. Alderman Michael Rodriguez says he has received reports from local restaurants and food vendors indicating sales have dropped by as much as 60%. One local mobile phone shop, he said, reported no sales over a two-week period. "Since President Trump has been in office, we noticed a major blip in the subsequent days in January and February," Rodriguez says. "Any detrimental impact on the business environment on 26th Street negatively impacts the region." But some political leaders support Trump's deportation plan, which was a central plank of his 2024 election campaign. "I love what he's doing," says Lupe Castillo, a Little Village resident and Republican candidate for Illinois' 4th Congressional District. "I'm sorry it had to come to this point, but this is the Democrats' fault. There are rules in this country. You can come in, but do it the right way. Then you can stay here and pursue the life you want." Castillo, who has lived in Little Village for more than 40 years, said this is the first time she has seen federal agents in the neighborhood but residents should continue supporting local businesses. "Just don't bring any attention to yourself," she said. "I know these people in the neighborhood, they're not bad people, so why would they be afraid? They're only coming after the bad guys." Rodriguez notes that a few businesses have remained steady during these uncertain times, such as some select grocery stores. However, as a lifelong resident of Little Village, Rodriguez says he has never seen anything like this. "We had public parking available for the first time in my life all across 26th Street," Rodriguez says. "At the lunch hour, where our restaurants are typically full, we saw empty restaurants. Even during the pandemic, it seems like we were more resilient." In response to the immigration raids, the city of Chicago has launched a programme to provide support to local businesses that have been affected. Ana Valencia, the Chicago city clerk, introduced an initiative called Shopping in Solidarity to encourages residents - and people from across the city - to shop locally and support their neighbours. "I think Chicagoans have found a way to unite during these crises," Valencia says. "What warms my heart is folks coming in and seeing what a vibrant neighbourhood it is." Despite these efforts, the result of declining foot traffic is being felt across the corridor, even at long-established restaurants like Taqueria Los Comales, a fixture in Little Village for more than five decades. Although Little Village's Chamber of Commerce does not have data on daily sales in the neighbourood, Christina Gonzalez, owner of Taqueria Los Comales and a board member of the Chamber of Commerce, says sales at many shops are down 30% to 60%. She says she herself has been forced to cut employees' hours. "We don't need 10 waitresses to be serving four tables," Gonzalez says. "It just doesn't make sense." Most employees are hired locally, she added, because residents tend to look for work close to home. "The community depends on these small businesses for jobs and income," Gonzalez says. "If they don't have the hours to withstand that, then they aren't getting the income that they need and they start cutting out all of their luxuries." Although it is still too early to know the full economic impact nationwide, economists have argued that mass deportations could harm the GDP, as many migrants work in key sectors, like agriculture, construction and manufacturing. A 2024 report by the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a nonpartisan think tank, argued that mass deportations could cut the GDP by 7% over three years. Similarly, a 2024 report from the US Congress Joint Economic Committee found that, depending on the scale of deportations, prices could rise by up to 9.1% by 2028. But supporters of the president's policies have argued that unchecked immigration ultimately costs more, including by straining public services. In 2024, the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that supports lower levels of immigration, testified before Congress that the lifetime fiscal drain (taxes paid minus costs) for each illegal immigrant is about $68,000 (£51,000). While economists and politicians debate the numbers, for Gonzalez and her employees the concern is more immediate - how to keep the lights on and food on the table. Adolfo Peña, owner of a shoe store called Zapateria Linda's, says his revenue has fallen by at least half since Trump took office. The decline has been particularly difficult for him. A Trump voter in the last election, Peña describes the outcome as a bitter disappointment. "This is the worst thing that has happened to us," he says. "Unfortunately, I voted for him. That hurts me the most. I had the confidence that he was going to change things." Peña said part of the decision to support Trump was driven by his frustration with Joe Biden's border policy. During Biden's presidency, Chicago saw a sharp rise in the number of migrants, with the city receiving over 51,000 arrivals from the southern border. Little Village became a key entry point, with one major shelter in the area housing 220 people in early 2024. Trump's electoral victory in 2024 was propelled by an uptick in Latino voters like Peña, who were concerned about the economy and the strain of illegal immigration. But since coming into office, Peña says his bottom line has been hurt more - first when Trump introduced tariffs on multiple countries, including some of his suppliers, and then during Operation Midway Blitz. "When this problem of ICE came in, everyone disappeared," Peña says. Inside Pollo Feliz, another restaurant in the neighbourhood, Marya works the register and says she has watched foot traffic dwindle. Those that do come into the restaurant take their order to go. "Those who come are those that have papers," Marya, who declined to give her last name, says. "Before, people used to come from far away. Since immigration [enforcement] is here, that doesn't happen any more." Marya says she understands the fear. She has witnessed immigration agents detaining street vendors selling tamales, chicharrónes and empanadas. She also recalls spotting them early in the morning in vehicles with tinted windows, some with their faces covered and rifles protruding. Rodriguez, the local politician, says the number of vendors is no longer what it once was. Before, several food vendors would arrive early to claim their corner spots, with customers already lining up before stalls were fully set up. In the warmer months, almost every corner of 26th Street was occupied. That bustle has since faded. Some vendors have stopped selling food altogether, leaving once-crowded corners empty. "The vendors on the street, who may not have formal documentation status in our country, have expressed to me concern not just for their livelihoods, but for being stripped away from their families," he says. "They're scared that their children won't have their parents at the dinner table." Edwin and Luna, who sell eggs on one of the corners of 26th Street, say street vendors come out less frequently - and for shorter periods. "They don't want to come out," they say. "We're not scared, but at the same time, we are. They don't respect if you're from here. They don't care." ICE raids across the US could increase in the coming months. The Trump administration plans to hire thousands of additional agents, open new detention centres, and work with private companies to locate people without legal status. Congress has also approved $170bn in funding for ICE and Border Patrol through September 2029. For the people of Little Village, the fear of ICE is ever present. It shapes who comes out, who works and who shops. Despite the uncertainty, families, businesses and community members remain committed to adapting and persevering in the new normal.

### 4. [Grammy Awards 2026: How to watch and who will win](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy12z197q8o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

Grammy Awards 2026: How to watch and who will win At the ripe old age of 67, the Grammy Awards are still considered "music's biggest night". This year's ceremony takes place in LA on Sunday, with everyone from Harry Styles to Chaka Khan due to attend. Kendrick Lamar tops the nominations with nine nods, most of them for his sixth album, GNX. He was the main winner at last year's ceremony, too, winning both record and song of the year for his scorching diss track, Not Like Us. Other contenders include Lady Gaga, with seven nominations, along with Bad Bunny, Sabrina Carpenter and Leon Thomas, who have six each. In total, there are 95 awards, distributed over a mind-boggling eight hours. Alongside banner categories like album of the year, we'll find out who had the best album artwork, and who's made the best "ambient, new age or chant" album. Here's everything you need to know ahead of the ceremony. 1) Who's going to win album of the year? Most insiders agree that there's a three-way race for the night's biggest prize - with Bad Bunny, Kendrick Lamar and Lady Gaga the presumed favourites. None of them have ever won before, despite multiple nominations, and there are good reasons to think they're the front-runners. Gaga is a Grammy darling, with 14 wins from 45 nominations. Her seventh album, Mayhem, is a triumphant return to the maximalist pop that made her famous, delivered with the hard-won grace of someone who's endured 18 years in the pop machine. Like Beyoncé last year, voters might feel she's put in the work to earn the top title. Lamar is in a similar position. He's the only artist with album of the year nominations for five consecutive releases, and GNX is a snappy, crowd-pleasing tour de force. Giving him the prize would also go some way to correcting the Grammys' rap problem. The last time a hip-hop album won album of the year was in 2004. But Bad Bunny is the presumptive front-runner. The Puerto Rican star's musically ambitious Debí Tirar Más Fotos, fuses live instrumentation with the hip-swaying pulse of reggaeton, plena, salsa and a multitude of other Latin styles. A win for Bad Bunny would mark the first win for a Spanish language album. That said, the Grammys have a habit of making spectacularly weird decisions, so don't discount the chances of Justin Bieber or Sabrina Carpenter lifting the trophy. Notably, no matter who wins album of the year, it will be their first victory in the category. 2) Will there be justice for Milli Vanilli?! Pop duo Milli Vanilli were stripped of their Grammy Award for best new artist in 1990, when it was discovered that the members, Fab Morvan and Rob Pilatus, had been miming to someone else's vocals. Thirty-six years later, Morvan is nominated for best audiobook for his memoir You Know It's True: The Real Story of Milli Vanilli. It's an eye-opening and harrowing story that lays bare what fame demands of you, and how Morvan struggled to rebuild his life after becoming one of music's biggest punchlines. If he wins, it could be an emotional moment of redemption. 3) Can Olivia Dean win best new artist? The British star is certainly a front-runner. Her joyful, old-school pop songs were deservedly massive last year, pairing classic songcraft with an unabashedly romantic outlook. Her album, The Art Of Loving, had a golden streak in December, just as voters were filling in their ballots, boosting her odds of victory. It came out too late to be shortlisted for album of the year, though. She'll have to wait 12 months for that one. Dean faces strong competition from fellow Brit Lola Young, whose cathartically confrontational single Messy was a breakout hit last year. R&B artist Leon Thomas could also sneak off with the trophy. A former writer for Ariana Grande, SZA and Post Malone, he's the only best new artist nominee to pick up an album of the year nod, which suggests he's popular with voters. The rest of the pack includes influencer-turned-pop star Addison Rae, influencer-turned-pop star Alex Warren, frenetic girl group Katseye, chiselled rock star Sombr and LA indie outfit The Marías. For the second year in a row, all eight new artist nominees will perform during a special segment on Sunday night. 4) What about the other big prizes? One of the year's most fiercely-contested categories is record of the year - better understood as "best single". That's where you'll find Sabrina Carpenter's Manchild butting heads with Lady Gaga's Abracadabra and Chappell Roan's The Subway. But none of them really captured the public imagination in the same way as Rosé and Bruno Mars's APT. A honking great crossover hit, it has exactly the sort of cross-generational appeal the Grammys loves. The only serious competition is Kendrick and SZA's Luther, a sumptuous rap ballad that spent 13 weeks at number one in America last year. If APT wins, it'll be a record-breaker twice over. Rosé will become the first K-pop artist to win a Grammy; and Mars will become the only artist to win record of the year four times. (Right now, he's tied with Paul Simon on three.) The song of the year award - which recognises the songwriters - has almost exactly the same shortlist, with the addition of Golden, from the movie K-Pop Demon Hunters. The prominent use of samples and interpolations in Luther and APT could put them at a disadvantage here; which is good news for Carpenter's Manchild - whose country-pop hybrid appeals to a broad cross-section of voters. Bad Bunny could also win here for DTMF (I should have taken more photos), a gorgeous rumination on the passage of time that segues into a lively celebration of life. 5) Is there a list of Grammy performers? Heck, yeah. And what a list... Justin Bieber - Sabrina Carpenter - Clipse & Pharrell Williams - Olivia Dean - Katseye - Lady Gaga - Lauryn Hill (Tribute to D'Angelo & Roberta Flack) - Reba McIntyre with Brandy Clark and Luka Nelson - The Marías - Bruno Mars - Post Malone, Slash, Chad Smith (Tribute to Ozzy Osbourne) - Addison Rae - Rosé - Sombr - Tyler, The Creator - Leon Thomas - Alex Warren - Lola Young - 6) Will Taylor Swift be performing? Not on your nelly. Rumours that Taylor Swift would turn up and tinkle the ivories were shot down by Grammy producer Ben Winston. Asked about the speculation by the showbiz website Hits Daily Double, he pointed out that the source of the story was... er, the showbiz website Hits Daily Double. "The only reason people think Taylor might be performing or coming is because Hits decided to print it this week and it was picked up globally," he said. "But Hits just totally made that up. And now I am getting asked about it by you, as if it's a real thing, when it was made up in your office!" Also not performing: Bad Bunny. His gig headlining the Super Bowl half time show next month means he's unable to take the stage at the Grammys. 7) Is it finally time for a K-pop Grammy? Right now, no K-pop artist has ever won a Grammy - although BTS have received multiple nominations and even performed at the ceremony. That could change on Sunday. Rosé, one quarter of the South Korean girl group Blackpink, is nominated for three awards for APT, her irresistible, cheerleader chanting duet with Bruno Mars. In the song of the year, she goes head-to-head with the fictional girl group Huntr/x, who appear in the hit animation K-Pop Demon Hunters. And Katseye, a global girl group trained under the arduous K-pop system, are also up for best group and best pop group performance, for their single Gabriela. They might not win, but there's a growing recognition that K-pop has become a cultural and commercial force. For Audrey Nuna, one of the singers behind Huntr/x, getting to perform at the show represents a huge step forward. "You're going to see three Korean faces," she told E! News. "To think about the kids who are going to see that, and hopefully for that to shape their understanding of what they can do in this world, is the stuff that is giving me chills up my spine." In an interview earlier this week, the Recording Academy CEO, Harvey Mason Jr, confirmed there was a "groundswell" amongst voters for a separate K-pop category. Could it be created just in time for BTS's comeback? Watch this space. 8) Any other notable nominees and surprises? Barbra Streisand could correct a historic wrong on Sunday night. Her duets album, The Secret of Life, is nominated for best traditional pop album - a category she has lost 13 times since it was introduced in 1992. Her chances look slim, though, with stronger albums by Lady Gaga, Elton John & Brandi Carlile, and Icelandic jazz singer Laufey all in the running. Festival headliners and generally excellent people Haim could become the first ever all-female band to win best rock album. "We really set out to make a rock album this time, so it's a huge milestone," Alana Haim told the BBC after their nomination. "But we're just grateful for the women that came before us." Wicked may have been snubbed at this week's Bafta nominations, but the cast are up for four Grammys - including best duet, for Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande's rendition of Defying Gravity. Elsewhere, the Dalai Lama is nominated for best audio book, for Meditations: The Reflections Of His Holiness The Dalai Lama. It's the first time a Dalai Lama has received a Grammy nomination. And we could end the night with the youngest-ever Grammy winner. Eight year old Aura V is nominated for best children's album for Harmony, a bubbly, life-affirming record she made with her dad, Harold Simmons II. 9) Will artists address the political situation in the US? In the week that Bruce Springsteen released a song denouncing "King Trump" and "federal thugs" in Minneapolis, it seems impossible that politics won't feature on the Grammys stage. Billie Eilish, nominated for record and song of the year, has called on her fellow musicians to "speak up" about the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers, whose actions have resulted in the death of two protestors. Bad Bunny didn't need prompting. He previously called ICE agents "sons of bitches" who won't leave "people alone and working". President Trump has defended the immigration operation in Minnesota, saying it took "thousands of hardened criminals" out of the state. On Wednesday, however, he said his administration would "de-escalate a little bit", amid rising tensions. Grammys boss Harvey Mason Jr said it was inevitable that emotions would spill onto the stage this Sunday. "You're going to hear and feel what's going on in the world through the music," he told CNN. "Maybe some people will choose to speak out about it, but you're definitely going to feel it in the music, in the performance, in the passion that goes into the art." 10) Who votes for the Grammys? This year, about 15,000 people were eligible to vote for the Grammys - including musicians, producers, lyricists, and even the people who write album liner notes. To qualify, they must be currently working in the music industry, and pay an annual subscription of $150 (£120) to the Recording Academy. All former winners are also eligible to vote. Every member is allowed to vote in up to 10 categories across three fields, such as rock, classical and R&B. They are encouraged only to vote in genres where their expertise lies. Additionally, every member, regardless of their background, gets to vote for the six biggest awards of the night. Those are: Album of the year, record of the year, song of the year, best new artist, songwriter of the year and producer of the year. The 2026 awards recognise music released between 31 August, 2024 and 30 August, 2025. More than 20,000 records were submitted for consideration this year. The winners will not be revealed until the ceremony. 11) How can I watch in the UK? The ceremony is split into two parts, with the first 80 awards distributed during what's called the "premiere ceremony" at 12:30 in Los Angeles / 20:30 in London on Sunday. It's often worth tuning in. The winners in the more obscure categories are less polished and more excited about winning, and the performances are looser and, dare I say it, more musical than the grandiose set pieces you'll see later. It's also the place to see British stars like Wet Leg, Yungblud, FKA Twigs and Sleep Token find out whether they've won in the rock and dance categories. That's also where you want to go to watch red carpet coverage, which kicks off at 15:00 in Los Angeles / 23:00 in the UK. Finally, the main show kicks off at 17:00 Los Angeles / 01:00 Monday in the UK. It's broadcast live in the US on CBS and streaming platform Paramount Plus. At present, there is no way to watch in the UK without circumventing geographical streaming restrictions, but clips from the ceremony appear on social media with incredible speed. Full speeches and select performances are usually uploaded to YouTube the following day.

Pedro Pascal and Meryl Streep lead tributes to Catherine O'Hara Meryl Streep, Pedro Pascal and Ben Stiller are among celebrities to have paid tribute to Emmy-winning actor Catherine O'Hara, who died on Friday aged 71. The Canadian-born star was best known for her roles in the films Beetlejuice and Home Alone, as well as comedy TV series including Schitt's Creek and The Studio. Streep said O'Hara brought "love and light to our world, through whipsmart compassion for the collection of eccentrics she portrayed", while The Last of Us co-star Pascal said he was "eternally grateful" to have worked with her. Ben Stiller said it was "hard to explain the impact she had on comedy", adding that for him there was "no one better". O'Hara died on Friday at her home in Los Angeles following a brief illness, her agent told the BBC. After starting her career in Canada's comedy scene, she turned out a series of unforgettable film performances netting her critical acclaim. Streep, who appeared alongside O'Hara in the 1980s comedy Heartburn, described her death as "such a loss for her family and friends, and the audience she graced as friends". Michael Keaton, who co-starred in 1988's Beetlejuice and its 2024 sequel Beetlejuice Beetlejuice, remarked: "We go back before the first Beetlejuice. She's been my pretend wife, my pretend nemesis and my real life, true friend. "This one hurts. Man am I gonna miss her." Tim Burton, who directed both films, shared a picture of the cast of the latter film on Facebook. "Catherine, I love you," he said. "This picture shows how much light you gave to all of us. You were a special part of my life and afterlife." Alec Baldwin, who also starred in the film, said O'Hara possessed "a quality that was all her own" and described her as "one of the greatest comic talents in the movie business". In his tribute, Pascal said "there is less light in my world" adding: "This lucky world that had you will keep you, always." Her on-screen son in holiday classics Home Alone and Home Alone 2: Lost In New York, Macaulay Culkin, also paid an emotional tribute on Instagram. "Mama. I thought we had time. I wanted more. I wanted to sit in a chair next to you," he wrote. "I heard you. But I had so much more to say. I love you. I'll see you later." O'Hara's popularity had a resurgence of late thanks to her award-winning performance as the outlandish matriarch Moira in Schitt's Creek. The show's co-creator Dan Levy, who played her son David, described O'Hara as "family before she ever played my family". He added on Instagram that he would "cherish every funny memory I was fortunate enough to make with her". His father Eugene Levy - who also starred in the series as O'Hara's on-screen husband Johnny Rose - had a longtime friendship with O'Hara, having collaborated with her many times over a period spanning more than 50 years. "Words seem inadequate to express the loss I feel today," he told Variety in a statement. "I cherished our working relationship, but most of all our friendship. And I will miss her." Annie Murphy, who played their daughter Alexis, wrote on Instagram that O'Hara's laugh "challenged anyone who heard it to join in, and be as delighted as she was". "Gosh, were we ever lucky to have her." Alongside winning a Golden Globe award for best actress in 2021 for her role in Schitt's Creek, O'Hara was nominated for portraying ousted movie executive Patty Leigh in Seth Rogen's satirical swipe at the workings of Hollywood, The Studio, at this year's awards. She also remains nominated at the Actor Awards (formerly the Screen Actors Guild Awards), which take place in March, for her role as Patty. Rogen said on Friday that, when he first met O'Hara, he told her she "was the funniest person I'd ever had the pleasure of watching on screen" and that Home Alone was the film that made him want to make movies. "Getting to work with her was a true honour," he wrote on Instagram. O'Hara was also described as "one of the comic giants of our age" by actor and director Christopher Guest, who worked with her on four films including 2006's For Your Consideration. His wife, actress Jamie Lee Curtis, shared a clip of O'Hara in Guest's 1996 mockumentary Waiting for Guffman, alongside the caption "BEST OF THE BEST IN SHOW", a reference to the title of one of his later films that also starred O'Hara. Fellow Canadian actor and comedian Mike Myers - of Austin Powers and Shrek fame - described her death as "a very sad day for comedy and for Canada". Former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau described her as a "beloved Canadian icon", while the country's current leader Mark Carney said it had "lost a legend". O'Hara is survived by her husband Bo Welch, her sons Matthew and Luke, and her six siblings.

### 6. [Federal judge denies request to block ICE surge in Minnesota](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c78vgnz3z6eo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

Federal judge denies request to block ICE surge in Minnesota A federal judge on Saturday denied a state government request to block the Trump administration's deployment of thousands of federal immigration agents in Minneapolis, Minnesota. In a ruling, District Court Judge Katherine Menendez said the immigration enforcement operation "has had, and will likely continue to have, profound and even heartbreaking, consequences on the State of Minnesota". But, she said, state officials had not proved that the Trump administration's surge of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in Minneapolis was unlawful. The ruling comes as thousands nationwide have taken to the streets to protest the fatal shootings of two US citizens by federal agents. Demonstrators are expected to gather on Saturday afternoon in Minneapolis, after protests were also held in cities across the US on Friday, including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Washington DC. Organisers called on Americans to stay home from work and school. The deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti have caused public outcry across the country, and led to criticism from lawmakers in both parties. Earlier on Friday, the US Justice Department opened a civil rights investigation into Pretti's death. The 37-year-old nurse was the second Minneapolis resident shot and killed by federal immigration officials since their arrival in the state. Good, the first, was killed by an ICE agent on 7 January. In her ruling on Saturday, Judge Menendez said there was "evidence that ICE and CBP agents have engaged in racial profiling, excessive use of force, and other harmful actions". But, she said, state officials "have provided no metric by which to determine when lawful law enforcement becomes unlawful commandeering". State and local officials had argued in their lawsuit that Trump's deployment of 3,000 immigration agents despite objections violated the state's sovereignty. Organisers of nationwide protests on Friday, called the National Shutdown, urged "no work. No school. No shopping" on 30 January to send the message to "stop funding ICE". The action was organised over the deaths of Pretti and Good, as well as others killed by ICE, including Silverio Villegas-Gonzales, who was shot by an ICE agent in September 2025, according to the group's website. Protesters formed the letters "SOS" on top of a frozen lake in southern Minneapolis, while one group marched through the streets carrying a large-scale replica of the preamble to the US constitution. Singer Bruce Springsteen also performed a newly released song in honour of Pretti and Good entitled Streets of Minneapolis at a concert in the city. On Thursday, border tsar Tom Homan suggested the Trump administration could "draw down" federal forces in the state if local officials co-operate. "We are not surrendering our mission at all. We're just doing it smarter," he said during a news conference. Homan began leading on-the-ground efforts in Minneapolis after it was announced Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino would be leaving the area. US President Donald Trump said on Thursday evening: "We will keep our country safe, we'll do whatever we can to keep our country safe." About 3,000 federal agents were sent to Minnneapolis at Trump's directive. The DHS has said it was arresting the "worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens" in an effort to restore public safety in Minnesota, but critics argue migrants with clean records and US citizens are being caught up in the campaign. Dubbed Operation Metro Surge, the immigration enforcement initiative has sparked outcry from residents in Minneapolis, St Paul and other cities in the state. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey have called on federal agents to withdraw from Minneapolis.

**Excerpt**

Musk's SpaceX applies to launch 1m satellites into orbit Elon Musk's SpaceX has applied to launch one million satellites into Earth's orbit to power artificial intelligence (AI). The application claims "orbital data centres" are the most cost and energy-efficient way to meet the growing demand for AI computing power. Traditionally, such centres are large warehouses full of powerful computers which process and store data. Musk's aerospace firm claims processing needs due to the expanding use of AI are already outpacing "terrestrial capabilities". It would increase the number of SpaceX satellites in orbit drastically. Its existing Starlink network of nearly 10,000 satellites has already been accused of creating congestion in space, which Musk denies. The new network could comprise up to one million solar-powered satellites, according to the application filed on Friday with the Federal Communications Commission - which does not specify a timeline for the plan. SpaceX claims the system would deliver the computer capacity required to serve "billions of users globally". It also says it would be the first step towards "becoming a Kardashev II-level civilisation - one that can harness the Sun's full power", referencing a scale of hypothetical alien societies proposed by an astronomer in the 1960s. Musk wrote on his social media site X: "The satellites will actually be so far apart that it will be hard to see from one to another. Space is so vast as to be beyond comprehension." Like the Starlink satellites, which provide high-speed internet, they would operate in low-Earth orbit at altitudes from 500-2,000km (310-1,242 miles). SpaceX claims "orbital data centres" - a concept also being explored by other firms - would be a greener alternative to traditional centres, which require enormous amounts of power and water for cooling. An expert previously told the BBC that launching hardware into orbit remains expensive and that the infrastructure to protect, cool and power them can be complex - while a growing quantity of space debris puts the physical hardware at risk. Separately, another cautioned that the growing number of low-orbit craft increases the possibility of crashes between objects - which could damage machines or send materials falling back to earth. Meanwhile, astronomers complained in 2024 that radio waves from the Starlink network were "blinding" their telescopes and hindering their research. Musk has previously rejected claims that his satellites were taking up too much room and crowding out competitors.

**Excerpt**

More than 200 killed in mine collapse in DR Congo More than 200 people have been killed in a mine collapse in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, rebel authorities have said. The mine, in the town of Rubaya, gave way on Wednesday due to heavy rains, Lumumba Kambere Muyisa, spokesman for the North Kivu region's rebel governor, told reporters. At the time, the death toll remained unclear. Women and children were among those mining coltan - a mineral used to manufacture electronics such as smartphones and computers - at the time. A former supervisor of the mine told the BBC the site was not properly maintained, making accidents more likely and hampering rescue efforts when they occur. He added that the fragile nature of the soil made the situation worse. Women, children and artisanal miners - those not officially employed by a mining firm - are among those killed in the collapse. Around 20 survivors are said to be receiving treatment in hospital. A source whose cousin died in the landslide expressed shock, saying it was "a big loss" for the family and community. "I didn't believe he could pass away in such circumstances," the source, who did not wish to be named, told the BBC, describing his cousin as a "courageous" and "ambitious" man whose main goal was to provide for his wife and two children. "I didn't believe [he was dead] because investigations were still ongoing. His body wasn't found after the accident, so I did have hope that he could be found alive. Unfortunately, some hours later, his body was discovered." Governor Erasto Bahati Musanga, who was appointed by M23 rebels after seizing swathes of territory in North Kivu, visited survivors of the incident on Friday. Rubaya is one of a number of towns across North Kivu under the control of the M23, who international observers say are backed by neighbouring Rwanda. The mines in Rubaya hold about 15% of the world's coltan supply and half of the DR Congo's total deposits. The metallic ore contains tantalum, which is used to produce high-performance capacitors in a range of electronic devices, making it in high demand worldwide. When a BBC team visited the site in July 2025, they observed miners digging manually to source the precious mineral. Conditions at the site are very bad, with dangerous pits dotted around its vast expanse. Since 2024, the M23 rebels have been in control of the mines. The UN has accused the group of imposing taxes on the mining sector for their own benefit. The BBC has contacted the Congolese government in Kinshasa for comment.

### 9. [The king's speech - and why it has foreigners in South Africa worried](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd6we3009dgo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

The king's speech - and why it has foreigners in South Africa worried South Africa's Zulu king has raised eyebrows by using a highly derogatory term for foreigners and saying they must all leave the country during a much-hyped speech that was supposed to have been aimed at calming anti-migrant feelings in his home province of KwaZulu-Natal. Warning: This story contains language some people may find offensive Misuzulu kaZwelithini was addressing his supporters at the place where 20,000 Zulus warriors defeated a British contingent of 1,800 soldiers 147 years ago beneath the rocky outcrop of Isandlwana hill. The Battle of Isandlwana, fought during the Anglo-Zulu war, is something many Zulus wear like a badge of honour: they fought against a foreign army and won - the foreigners were cowed. The ire of many of King Misuzulu's subjects is now directed not at British invaders but at migrants from neighbouring countries like Lesotho, Mozambique and Zimbabwe who have come to South Africa to work. According to official statistics, the country is home to about 2.4 million migrants, about 4% of the population. The 51-year-old monarch did not advocate violence but said all "kwerekwere", an offensive word for African migrants, must pack their bags - even if they were in relationships with South Africans and had children with them. "We must now sit down and discuss this because even if my nephew's father is a 'kwerekwere', the 'kwerekwere' must leave, only the child will remain," he said on Thursday to the delight of his audience - a response which prompted him to burst out laughing. Many online have been quick to point out the irony of his remarks, considering the king's own mother was from Eswatini and one of his wives is also from the neighbouring kingdom. But such xenophobic attitudes have long been an issue in South Africa, leading to deadly outbreaks of violence - and his comments echo those made by his late father Goodwill Zwelithini, who urged migrants in 2015 to "pack their belongings". He later tried to back-pedal, claiming he was misquoted, but the country's human rights body found his comments "hurtful and harmful". More than a decade on, xenophobia and anger directed at migrants remain a key political issue - with some believing foreigners are stealing jobs and benefiting from public services meant for South Africans. The rate of unemployment in the country remains one of the highest in the world at around 33%. This is something new opposition parties - like uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) led by former President Jacob Zuma, whose main support base is in KwaZulu-Natal - have latched on to with populist policies that support the expulsion of undocumented migrants. This has led in recent years to the rise of vigilante anti-migrant groups, like Operation Dudula and March on March, which have gained notoriety for their demands that foreign nationals be removed from the country. "Dudula" means "to remove something by force" in the Zulu language. Their latest campaign took place a few days before the king's speech and not long after the start of the academic year. An angry group of protesters descended on a primary school in the KwaZulu-Natal port city of Durban, claiming that 90% of the pupils there were the children of migrants. The heated demonstration forced the school to call parents to come and collect the students because of safety concerns - and the next day a large contingent of police was deployed to the gates of Addington Primary School. The local authorities hit out at the organisers of the march, which was also supported by MK, and accused them of spreading misinformation. "This has put a lot of people's lives at risk. It is a lie that 90% of learners are children of immigrants. The truth is that immigrants form 37% of the learner population," Mlu Mtshali, an education spokesperson for KwaZulu-Natal, told South Africa's Daily Maverick newspaper. This prompted the education department to reveal that nationally, 253,618 foreign pupils are enrolled in South Africa's public schools - 1.8% of all students. Of these, 14,929 are at public schools in KwaZulu-Natal. Commentators have also pointed out that in South Africa, all children have a legal right to basic education, irrespective of their nationality or status in the country. Following the Addington Primary School protests and ahead of the Battle of Isandlwana commemoration, royal envoys hinted that King Misuzulu would address these concerns. He has no formal political power, but a fifth of South Africa's population is Zulu and the monarchy remains hugely influential with a large budget funded by taxpayers. The king also oversees a trust that owns and controls vast tracts of communal land in KwaZulu-Natal, which is supposed to be for the benefit local communities. "We will speak to the 'kwerekweres' and tell them to leave. There is nobody who does not have a home to return to," the king said. For Dr Vusumusi Sibanda, a human rights lawyer and expert on African diaspora issues, such words are "unfortunate" and "worrying" and encourage ordinary citizens to take the law into their own hands. "The king is respected by [many people], including foreigners, and he's supposed to be that symbol," he told the BBC. Lizette Lancaster, who works at South Africa's Institute for Security Studies think-tank, echoes this, telling me that the king's comments only served to "fuel anti-migrant sentiment and should be strongly condemned". She also weighed in on the actions of vigilante groups, saying that while South African law protected activism, orchestrating vigilante activity "including incitement or actions against migrants, must be identified and dealt with". The leader of March on March, Jacinta Ngobese Zuma, is now facing a public violence charge over the protests at Addington Primary School. And in November, a court ordered Operation Dudula to stop blocking foreign nationals from accessing public health facilities and schools, saying it was illegal. Another topic raised by the king that has the nation talking is his call to drop "Natal" from KwaZulu-Natal's name - again echoing a wish of his father. "We need to remove this 'Natal'. This is KwaZulu, so I don't understand why we have this Natal," the king said. Prior to 1994 and the end of South Africa's racist system of apartheid, the province now known as KwaZulu-Natal was split into two. KwaZulu was classified as a "homeland", a semi-autonomous area reserved for ethnic Zulus, which existed within Natal province. When South Africa ushered in democratic rule with Nelson Mandela elected president, the two were merged and the name conjoined. Over the last three decades, many cities, towns and roads in South Africa have been renamed, replacing them with indigenous ones or calling them after heroes of the struggle against apartheid. But for some commentators, the call to name the province simply KwaZulu is an unpalatable reminder of Zulu nationalism and its potential dangers. In the years after Mandela's release from prison in 1990, political violence between his supporters and those of a Zulu nationalist party nearly derailed the process that led to the end of white-minority rule. There are fears that renaming KwaZulu-Natal would create a kind of exceptionalism that could lead to more trouble in the ethnically diverse country which has 11 official languages. Cultural expert Prof Musa Xulu is also quick to add that it would be wrong to regard KwaZulu-Natal as a Zulu province. "In reality, it's a multicultural province," he told the BBC. "[Re]naming it KwaZulu would be a distortion of history. There was never a time in history when this whole region… was a kingdom of the Zulus," he said. Zulus "don't have the powers to simply push people around and say that the province should be known as KwaZulu", the academic added. Until now King Misuzulu, on the throne since 2022, has mainly made the headlines with regard to the royal succession battle and his controversial divorce. But now he seems to be following in his father's footsteps - and picking at scabs that never get a chance to heal in what is a politically charged environment.
