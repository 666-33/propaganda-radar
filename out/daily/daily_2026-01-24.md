Hundreds of Minnesota businesses close to protest ICE presence Hundreds of businesses in Minnesota closed on Friday and thousands of protesters turned out in severely cold weather to demonstrate against the ongoing immigration crackdown in the state. The widespread rallies come after organisers encouraged residents to skip work or school and refrain from shopping in a show of opposition to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The ICE operation ordered by the Trump administration in Minnesota has been going on for more than six weeks. The administration has characterised it as a public safety operation aimed at deporting criminals illegally in the country. Critics warn migrants with no criminal record and US citizens are being detained too. On Friday, about 100 clergy members were arrested at the Minneapolis airport while holding a protest calling on US airlines to refuse to transport detainees arrested by ICE. A spokesman for the airports commission told the Minnesota Reformer that the arrests took place after the "permitted activity went beyond agreed upon terms" and was to done to protect the public safety and airport access. Thousands of federal officers have been deployed to Minnesota as part of "Operation Metro Surge". The killing of 37-year-old Minneapolis woman Renee Good earlier this month flared tensions across the state and brought condemnation from local officials. "We want ICE out of Minnesota, and we want ICE out of every state, with their extreme overreach," said Bishop Dwayne Royster, whose organisation Faith in Action is supporting local partners in Minneapolis during the strike. "We want Congress to stand up and provide oversight to ICE." Friday's marches are thought to be the largest display of opposition to date to the current immigration policy in the state, as thousands of people walked downtown through temperatures of -23C (-10F). As they made their way to the city's NBA arena to hold an anti-ICE rally, taking place on the home court of the Minnesota Timberwolves, protesters chanted and played music. On Friday morning, Minneapolis resident Corey Lamb closed his business, Harriet Grove Botanicals, in solidarity and headed to a protest. He objected to the presence of ICE agents in his city, and was outraged by Good's death in early January. He also saw the immigration raids as an economic threat to his business, and others in his community. "We have a lot of friends that we rely on, we have a lot of businesses that we rely on, in order to make our business work," Lamb told the BBC. "When those individuals are struggling because they're afraid of being detained or disappeared, it has an effect not only morally but economically on what's going on here, and also in the greater Midwest." Lamb's business was joined by hundreds of others, from restaurants and tattoo parlours to toy stores. Kim Bartmann is the owner of six restaurants in Minneapolis, including four that remain open in the winter but that she shut on Friday. While she supports the cause, she said the decision to participate had been a tricky one, given the costs. "Everyone is in solidarity, but everyone needs to buy groceries and pay their rents," she said, noting that staff at one of her locations had initially asked to stay open, before deciding the risk of backlash over not participating would be too great. "Economically, it is a severe blow to my business," she said. She said sales at her restaurants, which include Barbette and Gigi's Café, have already dropped more than 30% over the past three weeks as a result of the ICE operation, which has prompted her to limit her opening hours as customers and staff stay home. "We have a lot of employees who are US citizens or have paperwork to work in the US who are still terrified to leave their homes," she said. ICE's presence has outraged many of Minnesota's residents, who have protested against their operations and other federal officers operating in their city. This week, school officials in the suburb of Columbia Heights announced that four of their students had been detained by ICE, ranging from ages five to 17. A two-year-old child was also detained on Thursday alongside her undocumented father while returning home from a grocery store in south Minneapolis, according to CBS News, the BBC's US partner. In a speech on Thursday, Vice-President JD Vance called for local Minnesota law enforcement to coordinate with federal officers to carry out immigration enforcement. Minnesota, and some of its cities, have so-called "sanctuary" policies, which limit the ways that local government and law enforcement cooperates with ICE. The Trump administration has criticised these policies as a threat to public safety. Meanwhile, a Minneapolis FBI agent resigned this week over concerns about the bureau's handling of the investigation into Good's shooting, CBS News, the BBC's US partner, reported. The New York Times was first to report the resignation. Tracee Mergen left "in part due to the pressure on her to reclassify/discontinue the investigation" over Good's death, CBS News reported, citing sources. The BBC has contacted the FBI for comment. Earlier this month, US media reported that at least six prosecutors in the Minneapolis US Attorney's office resigned over the administration's handling of the federal investigation.

New Zealand calls off rescue efforts for six missing after landslide Rescue efforts for six missing people buried by a landslide in New Zealand on Thursday have been called off, with efforts now moving to recovering bodies, police have said. "Tragically it is now apparent that we will not be able to bring them home alive," Anderson said, adding that formal identification is underway. Two teenagers are among those who remain unaccounted for, with the youngest aged 15 years old. Search teams located human remains beneath dirt and debris on Friday evening, Police Superintendent Tim Anderson said, after a landslide hit a popular campsite in Mount Maunganui. "This is heartbreaking news for the families and the dozens of people who have been working day and night, hoping for a positive outcome," Anderson said. In a separate incident, two people died - a grandmother and her grandchild - in a different landslide at Welcome Bay, nearby Mount Maunganui, public service broadcaster Radio New Zealand (RNZ) reported. Heavy rain has fallen on New Zealand's North Island for days, with more wet weather forecast for the area over the weekend. Police said conditions have added to the difficulty of rescue efforts, and described the scene at Mount Maunganui as "incredibly challenging... to work through". Fire and emergency services worked through the night to locate those unaccounted for at the campsite before the operation was formally handed over to police on Saturday. The safety of workers on the ground is of "upmost importance", Anderson said. Police have confirmed the names of the six individuals unaccounted for as Lisa Anne Maclennan, 50, from Morrinsville, Måns Loke Bernhardsson, 20, from Sweden, Jacqualine Suzanne Wheeler, 71, from Rotorua, and Susan Doreen Knowles, 71, from Ngongotaha. The youngest victims have been identified by police as Sharon Maccanico, 15, from Auckland and Max Furse-Kee, 15, from Auckland. Chief Coroner Judge Anna Tutton confirmed the identification process is underway, but warned it would likely be "complex" and "painstaking". "We will work very carefully - and as quickly as we can - to reunite families," she said. Prime Minister Christopher Luxon visited the site on Friday. He said it was "inspiring" to see the show of community support as locals helped clear debris in flood-hit areas. Mount Maunganui is a sacred Māori site and one of the most popular campgrounds in New Zealand. It has been repeatedly hit by landslides in recent years.

Indonesia landslide kills 7, dozens more missing At least seven people have died and more than 80 others are missing after a landslide hit Indonesia's West Java province, officials said. The landslide occurred in the West Bandung region, south-east of the capital Jakarta, following days of intense rainfall. More than thirty homes were destroyed after "landslide material buried residential areas, causing fatalities and affecting local residents", Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency said in a statement. Flooding, landslide and extreme weather alerts have also been issued for the broader region. The landslide hit the village of Pasirlangu around 02:30AM on Saturday (19:30 GMT). Two dozen people were evacuated safely from the affected region, according to Abdul Muhari, communication chief of the National Search Agency. Images shared by local news outlets showed homes buried under mud and debris.

### 4. [TikTok US venture to collect precise user location data](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgnj7v2rr5o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

TikTok US venture to collect precise user location data TikTok's new US joint venture has made changes to its privacy policy that include expanding the type of location data the company can collect from its 200 million American users. The new policy was published after investors closed a deal with TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance on Thursday to run the popular short-form video app's business in the US. The new joint venture said in its updated privacy terms that it may now "collect precise location data, depending on your settings" - a change from the previous policy which allowed for the collection of "approximate" location data. TikTok did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment on the change. The company policy added that the sensitive personal information would be processed "in accordance with applicable law" and that users can turn off location services in their device settings at any time. Even before the new venture was established, TikTok collected location information based on a user's SIM card or IP address, or both. But it stopped short of collecting even approximate GPS information from American users operating the most updated version of the app, according to a 2024 version of its privacy policy. Precise location sharing hasn't yet been enabled in the US, where it is expected to be optional and turned off by default so users will be asked to opt in with a pop-up message. TikTok has not said when the update is due to reach American users. TikTok already collects similar data from users in the UK and Europe as part of a new "Nearby Feed" feature that lets users find events and businesses near them. The new American TikTok joint venture is also extending its permissions for gathering information about users interactions with TikTok's artificial intelligence (AI) tools. This includes prompts and questions submitted by users, as well as information about how, when, and where AI content was prompted or created. TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC is comprised of three managing investors including cloud computing giant Oracle, which is investing heavily in AI infrastructure and has taken on significant debt to finance its ambitions in the burgeoning space. Oracle is chaired by Larry Ellison, a Republican megadonor and longtime ally of US President Donald Trump, whose administration helped broker the US TikTok deal. The agreement follows years of tussling between Washington and Beijing that began in Trump's first presidential term, when he tried unsuccessfully to ban the app over national security concerns. In 2024, the US passed a law that required the platform to be banned in the US by January 2025 if ByteDance failed to sell its US operations to American investors. Trump repeatedly postponed the enforcement of legislation until the joint venture was finalised this week. The 2024 law was prompted in part by concerns about the possibility that Beijing might access the data of TikTok's American users. In a statement onThursday, the new joint venture said its mandate was "to secure U.S. user data, apps and the algorithm through comprehensive data privacy and cybersecurity measures". Oracle will oversee the retraining of TikTok's powerful content recommendation algorithm on existing American user data, the joint venture said in its statement, adding that the algorithm "will be secured in Oracle's U.S. cloud environment." ByteDance retains a minority stake just shy of 20% in the joint venture. Other managing investors include the US tech investment firm Silver Lake and Abu-Dhabi state-owned investment fund MGX, which has done business with the Trump family's crypto venture World Liberty Financial. On Friday, Republican Representative John Moolenaar, who chairs the House Select Committee on China, expressed concern about ByteDance's ongoing involvement in TikTok's US operations. "Does this deal ensure China does not have influence over the algorithm? Can the parties involved assure Americans their data is secure?" he said in a statement. "Those are questions that need to be answered as the Select Committee does oversight of this deal."

### 5. [High stakes but low expectations for Ukraine talks with Russia and US](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3edde1pwx8o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

High stakes but low expectations for Ukraine talks with Russia and US Negotiators from Russia, Ukraine and the US have been meeting in Abu Dhabi for their first trilateral talks since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. But whilst the talks take a new format, the core differences remain the same. The stakes are high, but expectations are limited. Donald Trump is pushing hard for a peace deal in Ukraine – the one he promised but hasn't yet delivered – and he said this week that the two sides would be "stupid" if they couldn't agree. But despite some intense shuttle diplomacy by his own envoys, they are hosting the first trilateral talks involving Ukrainian and Russian negotiators with some major issues still unresolved. Ukraine is engaging with the process because it wants peace more than anyone, but also because it needs to keep the US onside. It learned that lesson the hard way last year, when Donald Trump briefly suspended intelligence sharing and military aid. Now, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky says his talks with Trump in Davos were "really positive" and he hopes for more air defence support against Russia's relentless attacks as a result. Often grim-faced after his encounters with the US leader, this time Zelensky seemed unusually upbeat. But he remains cautious on the outcome of talks in the United Arab Emirates. He's described the meetings, which may last two days, as "a step", but shied away from calling it a positive one. "We have to wish it will push us a bit closer to peace," is how he put it. For a while, Zelensky has talked about being 90% of the way to producing a framework deal for peace, but the final 10% was always going to be the hardest - and Russia could still reject the whole thing. "It's all about the eastern part of our country. It's all about the land. This is the issue that's not resolved yet," he explained, spelling out the biggest obstacle that he says still remains. Russia insists that Ukraine should hand over the big slice of the eastern Donbas region, which it has failed to win on the battlefield. Ukraine refuses. Politicians often talk about their red lines, but for this country the line in the Donbas is drawn with the blood of the soldiers who died defending it. Zelensky can't cross it. As I write this, the music from another soldier's funeral is drifting up from a church in the street. On my way back into Ukraine this time, we drove past so many military graves in roadside cemeteries, all marked with flags. The other big issue up for discussion in the UAE is what the US would do, militarily, if Russia were to invade Ukraine again someday. That's what Ukraine calls its "security guarantees", and says are essential. Zelensky says the deal between the US and Ukraine is done, but we have no real details. Russia's response also remains a wide-open question. There's also the giant new doubt about how good a guarantee from Donald Trump really is: the US president's fixation on "acquiring" Greenland has severely undermined Nato. He's also undermined the very principle of protecting a nation's sovereignty, the whole basis for Western support for Ukraine. So can Kyiv trust him to come to the rescue in the next crisis? For now, it doesn't have much choice. As for trusting Vladimir Putin, no one here is under any illusions that his aims have changed. "He really doesn't want it," is what Zelensky said in Davos about Putin and peace. The Kremlin has said that if it doesn't get what it wants at the talking table, it will "achieve its aims on the battlefield" - though it's failed so far, despite sacrificing a huge number of soldiers. So once again, it's targeting civilian infrastructure across the country - but in a more deliberate, sustained, and devastating way than ever before. In the depths of a bitter winter, that's left people freezing in their homes. Today, the mayor of Kyiv again called on city residents to leave if they have somewhere to go. "The enemy will most likely continue to attack the critical infrastructure of the city and the country," Vitali Klitschko warned. After repeat attacks, the system is very fragile. "I address the residents and say honestly: the situation is extremely difficult and this may not be the most difficult moment yet."

**Excerpt**

Four attacks in 48 hours: How east Australia's beaches became a 'perfect storm' for sharks It's "extraordinary", says shark researcher Chris Pepin-Neff: four shark bites within 48 hours, and three of them within a 15-kilometre stretch of Australia's east coast. On 18 January, a 12-year-old boy was taken to hospital with critical injuries and later died after being attacked while swimming in Sydney Harbour. The next day, an 11-year-old's surfboard was bitten at Dee Why beach, hours before a man was attacked at nearby Manly and taken to hospital in critical condition. Then, on 20 January, a fourth surfer "sustained a wound to his chest" after a shark bit his board some 300km (186 miles) up the coast. "This is the closest - in both proximity and in time - series of shark bites that I've ever seen in my 20 years of research," says Pepin-Neff, who is an associate professor of public policy at the University of Sydney. The rapid spate of incidents triggered local and international alarm, with dozens of beaches closed amid fear of further attacks. Predictably, calls for shark culls have gathered momentum and volume. Experts, however, have cautioned against such measures, advocating instead for a greater awareness of shark behaviour and urging a rethink of humans' relationship to these fish. There are multiple factors that likely contributed to the recent spate of incidents, they say – and it's not the sharks that are the problem. Why suddenly so many shark attacks in Australia? Non-provoked shark attacks are usually precipitated by environmental conditions, attractants in the water, or both. The three recent incidents in Sydney - all of which are thought to have involved bull sharks – followed several days' worth of heavy rain, during which the city's official weather station recorded 127 millimetres of downpour within 24 hours – its wettest January day in 38 years. That rainfall would have created "perfect conditions" for bull sharks, according to Rebecca Olive, senior research fellow at RMIT University. "Bull sharks thrive in warm, brackish water, which most other sharks flee," she told the BBC. "They love river mouths and estuaries, so the freshwater that flooded off the land following the recent rain events was perfect for them." Olive and other experts further note that this freshwater would have likely flushed sewage and nutrients into the sea, thus drawing in bait fish and, in turn, sharks. "There's clearly an attractant in the water," Pepin-Neff says, suggesting that a "perfect storm" of low salinity freshwater could have created a "biodiversity explosion". "The bait fish come to the surface, the bull sharks come to the surface, everybody's in the near shore area – and now we have a problem." Are shark attacks increasing overall? Official statistics show that shark bite incidents in Australia have gradually increased over the past 30 years – rising from around eight to 10 per year in the 1990s, to yearly averages in the mid-20s from the 2010s onwards. That doesn't mean sharks are becoming more aggressive, though. More likely is that the higher numbers reflect better data collection, as well as a number of compounding human factors. These include a growing coastal population, an increased uptake of water sports and thicker wetsuits that allow swimmers to stay in the ocean for longer. "The number of total encounters is definitely much higher than it was, just because the population of people who go in the water and do all these things is really high," Pepin-Neff explains. They also point out, however, that the rate of shark bites "doesn't tick up at the amount it should for the proportion of people who are going in the water and doing more things". Olive echoes this point, noting that "given how many people use the ocean each day, incidents and attacks are relatively uncommon, and fatalities are even less common". If it seems as though sharks are becoming more prolific or dangerous, Olive suggests this may just be a result of them being more visible to members of the community – whether because of better reporting systems, the proliferation of drone footage or the outsized attention that shark encounters receive from the media. Pepin-Neff adds that broad, imprecise language around encounters is likely fuelling fears and distorting people's understanding of the risk. When shark sightings, encounters and bites all get conflated under the catchall umbrella of an "attack", the danger seems greater than it is. "There is a problem in being able to meaningfully describe what happened without using the words 'shark attack'," they explain. "And that creates a more emotional community experience that is slightly different to what actually happened." Do shark culls work? In the wake of Sydney's recent flurry of shark attacks, heightened fears have reinvigorated calls for a cull. Typically, this would involve using nets or baited drumlines to catch and kill sharks near popular beaches. Experts reject the suggestion. "I can understand when there are calls for culls in response [to an attack]... but I'm strongly opposed to culling sharks in order that we can maintain an illusion of safety while surfing or swimming in the ocean," says Olive. Pepin-Neff, meanwhile, stresses that scientific research does not support shark culls as an effective method of reducing the danger of an attack. "It just doesn't work," they say. "It makes politicians feel better, and it makes activists feel better, and it makes nobody in the water any safer." In cases of shark encounters, they add, the variable is not the sharks themselves, but rather the attractant that's drawing them to the area. "It doesn't matter if you kill all the sharks in Sydney Harbor – if there's a shark up the coast and the attractant is still in the water, then the shark's going to come in." How can people avoid shark attacks? Both Olive and Pepin-Neff suggest that the best way to minimise risk is to be more conscious and wary of the factors that exacerbate the likelihood of a shark encounter. On an individual level, this might mean avoiding swimming and surfing after heavy rain. For councils it might mean creating more shark enclosures where people can swim safely. More broadly, however, they emphasise the need for beach-goers to adopt a less idyllic and more pragmatic attitude towards the ocean. "In Australia we've got to treat the beach like the bush," says Pepin-Neff. "Australians know how to navigate the wild. We just need to reinforce that the ocean is still the wild." This will require a rethink not only of our relationship with the water, they add, but also our relationship with sharks. "This idea that the ocean is always safe but the sharks are always dangerous – it's the opposite," they say. "The ocean is never safe, and the sharks are not always dangerous. "We're in the way, not on the menu."

**Excerpt**

Tragic chapter on the trains sends rail superpower Spain into crisis "Since the high-speed line was built, 30-something years ago, we never had any problems, it worked perfectly and was fantastic," says Alberto Montavez Montes, a shop-owner opposite Córdoba city hall, where the Spanish and Andalusian flags have been hanging at half-mast. Now, though things feel different: "It's not that there's psychosis, but it does make you just a bit reluctant to get on a train, without a doubt." In just a few tragic days since two high-speed trains collided in this southern region of Spain, with the loss of 45 lives, it has felt that Spain's much-vaunted rail system has been thrown into a sudden, deep crisis. Second only to China in scale, Spain has 3,900 km (2,400 miles) of high-speed (AVE) rail and until now its national network has been admired for its efficiency and safety. In 2009, then-US president Barack Obama singled out Spain for praise when he outlined a vision for the creation of a high-speed rail network across America. The line connecting Madrid and Seville "is so successful that more people travel between those cities by rail than by car and airplane combined", he said. At the time a Spanish-led consortium had just begun work on a high-speed link across the Saudi Arabian desert, confirming the country's status as a rail superpower. That reputation has been humbled this week. Last Sunday, the back three carriages of a train run by private Italian operator Iryo derailed at high speed, along a straight stretch of track, into the path of an oncoming train run by national rail operator Renfe which bore the brunt of the crash. Two days later, a trainee driver was killed when a wall collapsed on to a suburban rail line near Barcelona in the north-east after heavy rainfall, derailing a train. The same day another local train in Catalonia hit a rock, although nobody was injured. And on Thursday, several passengers on a narrow-gauge train suffered minor injuries when a crane struck a carriage. Train drivers in Catalonia refused to work in the wake of the accident near Barcelona, demanding safety guarantees and contributing to two days without local rail services in the region. Separately, train drivers' union Semaf has called a nationwide strike for three days in February over what it has described as "the constant deterioration of the rail network". In addition, several high-speed lines have had their speed limits temporarily reduced, due to safety concerns. Throughout the week, delays, stoppages and other incidents affecting the rail system over recent months have been pored over in the media, while members of the public have aired grievances on social media about uncomfortable or alarming travel experiences. "I think the trains aren't as safe as before," says Olga Márquez, another resident of Córdoba. Her husband regularly travels to Madrid for work, on the same line on which the high-speed collision took place, and she says he has often mentioned vibrations and noises during the journey which suggested to her the track was not in optimum state. "I'm happy to get on a train, but when it comes to my husband, all this makes me think twice," she says. A long delay between the high-speed crash and the rail and rescue services' realisation that two trains – rather than just one – had been involved has created doubts about the emergency response to such tragedies. The government, the civil guard and an independent commission all continue to investigate the Andalusia crash, although sabotage and human error appear to have been ruled out. Meanwhile politicians, commentators, and ordinary Spaniards have been debating the possible cause as well as highlighting weaknesses in Spain's overall rail system. The amount of investment the rail network receives has come under particular scrutiny. The Socialist-led government has sought to dismiss such queries, pointing out, for example, that €700m (£605m) has been invested in updating the Madrid-Andalusia line in recent years, with the stretch of track where the accident took place included in that renovation. "We're not looking at a problem of lack of maintenance, we're not looking at a problem of obsolete [infrastructure], and we're not looking at a problem of lack of investment," said the transport minister Óscar Puente. A preliminary report by rail accident investigation commission CIAF has found that grooves found on the wheels of the derailed Iryo train and three earlier trains suggests that a fracture in the track occurred before the Iryo train went over it. Urging caution, Puente said he suspected "a problem that we have never seen on our network before." Figures released by his ministry show a sharp increase in maintenance spending on the rail system since Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez took office in 2018. However, other data tells a different story: Spain was bottom of an index published by German railway association Allianz pro Schiene of spending per capita on rail infrastructure by 14 European countries in 2024. Salvador García-Ayllón, head of the civil engineering department at Cartagena's University-Polytechnic, described the high-speed network as being "the jewel in the crown of Spanish infrastructure". However, the liberalisation of the rail sector in 2020, allowing France's Ouigo and Italy's Iryo to provide high-speed services, may have increased competitivity and reduced ticket prices, but it has also put more pressure on the system. Around 22 million travellers currently use Spain's high-speed trains each year, around double the number prior to the liberalisation, and 17 times the number of users in 1992, the year the Madrid-Seville line was inaugurated. Salvador García-Ayllón also points to new lines which have been built over recent years – including the north-western region of Galicia and the northern city of Burgos, with a new route along the Mediterranean under construction – whose upkeep presents a challenge. All of this, he said, has left Spanish rail "bursting at the seams". "The challenge is not just to buy a Ferrari, you have to take the Ferrari to the garage," he said. "You have to invest in maintaining the infrastructure you have." The high-speed rail system's reliability has dropped noticeably in recent years. In July of 2025, its trains were 19 minutes late on average, according to data provided by Renfe. Local rail has also seen a rise in incidences, such as delays, cancellations and technical problems, which have more than tripled since 2019 on the Madrid local Cercanías network. Catalonia, which suffered the double accident on Tuesday, has had longstanding and well-documented deficiencies in its suburban Rodalies network, which have fed into its political tensions with Madrid over the last decade. Perhaps inevitably, the recent tragedies have already spilled into the deeply divided political arena. Far-right party Vox has said that "travelling in Spain [by train] is no longer safe", a claim that fits into its repeated insistence that the country is akin to a failed state. The main opposition People's Party (PP), meanwhile, has accused the government of hiding information about the high-speed crash. The prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has acknowledged that the accident in southern Spain caused "irreparable" damage. Yet he also insisted that the high-speed network "is the cause of pride for the country". Not so long ago, few Spaniards would have queried that assertion. Now, many will find it hard to agree.

'Half of my friends were killed' - the girls returning to a school caught up in war It had been a normal day for 18-year-old twins Makarem and Ikram when their school came under fire. Makarem was in an English literature class and Ikram was in a science lesson when they heard "strange sounds" coming from outside the school in Sudan. Then the shelling started. Makarem says her shoulder "tilted" as she was struck. Screaming, her classmates dropped to the floor to avoid shellfire and find somewhere to hide. "We took cover beside the wall and the girl who was standing in front of me put her hand on my shoulder and said: 'Your shoulder is bleeding.'" In the chaos, the two sisters, who had been in separate classrooms, tried to reach each other but couldn't. Later, Ikram searched for her sister, not knowing she'd already been taken to hospital. Like others who were injured, Makarem was taken to hospital by local residents who drove the wounded by car and animal-drawn carts because there was no ambulance service in el-Obeid, the city where they lived. Eventually, her teachers and classmates had to convince Ikram to abandon the search and go home. It was only when Makarem returned home from hospital later that day that her family found out she was still alive. "I waited for her outside the front door and when I saw her coming we all cried," says Ikram, who had been in a part of the school that wasn't hit, so was unharmed. Makarem and Ikram's English teacher and 13 classmates were killed and dozens more injured in the shelling at the Abu Sitta girls' school, in el-Obeid, in North Kordofan state, in August 2024. The school normally has about 300 students. Regional authorities accuse the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) - the paramilitary group at war with the Sudanese army - of firing the shells. The RSF has never commented on the incident and did not respond to the BBC's request for comment. It is not clear whether the shelling of the school was intentional. Makarem says half of her friends at school were killed while the other half were injured. As well as injuring her shoulder, she also suffered a head wound, but was discharged from hospital having received basic treatment. But several days later, after developing severe headaches, she was given a CT scan which found a small piece of shrapnel in her head. "It hurt very much and I had to take many painkillers," she says. Sudan's civil war began in April 2023 and has resulted in the deaths of more than 150,000 people, with millions forced from their homes. The United Nations says the country is now enduring the world's worst humanitarian crisis. Sudan's oil-rich Kordofan region - which is divided into North, South and West Kordofan states - has become a major front line in the war due to its strategic significance, sitting between RSF-controlled areas in the west and eastern areas where the army is mostly in charge. Analysts say whoever controls the region effectively controls the country's oil supply, as well as a large chunk of the country. An estimated 13 million of the 17 million school-age children who have remained in Sudan are out of school, according to the UN. North Darfur, under RSF control, is the worst affected state, according to the charity Save the Children, with just 3% of its schools open. The Abu Sitta school was closed for three months after the attack while it was renovated. Makarem and Ikram said initially they could not imagine returning to the place where their friends and teacher had been killed. "But when I saw my friends returning and telling me that things were OK, I decided to return," says Ikram. Even so, returning to school brought back painful memories. "I used to close my eyes on the way to class to avoid looking at the area where the shelling happened," Ikram says. A number of students were given psychological support at the school when they returned, says headteacher Iman Ahmed. Beds and nurses were also made available at the school to allow injured students to take their exams in comfort. Although el-Obeid is still being subjected to repeated drone attacks, students at the school were playing and laughing in the courtyard when the BBC visited in December. The headteacher describes the girls' determination to continue their studies, despite what happened to them, "as a form of defiance and loyalty to those who were lost". But the situation for children trying to learn in el-Obeid remains challenging. The city lived under a siege by the RSF for more than a year and a half, until the Sudanese army regained control in February 2025. While there is now relative calm, dozens of schools have been converted into shelters for people fleeing the war. El-Obeid hosts nearly one million displaced people across various shelters, according to the state's humanitarian aid commissioner. Ibtisam Ali, a student at a secondary school that has been converted, says she cannot leave her classroom until the end of the school day because the grounds are full of displaced people. "Even going to the bathroom has become a problem for us," she says. Walid Mohamed Al-Hassan, the minister of education in North Kordofan state, said the presence of displaced families in schools had caused problems - including with sanitation - but that these are "the conditions of war and the cost of war". In spite of the war and everything that has happened, Makarem and Ikram, who are now 19, are hopeful about their futures. Ikram completed her studies at school and is now studying English at university in el-Obeid. She was inspired by her English teacher, Fathiya Khalil Ibrahiem, who was killed in the attack. The death of her friends made her even more determined to complete her studies, she says. "I kept reminding myself that we should carry the same ambition to achieve what they were unable to achieve." Makarem, meanwhile, wants to become a doctor like those who treated her after she was injured. She passed her secondary school exams but did not achieve the score required to be admitted to study medicine at university. Makarem says the shrapnel lodged in her head, which cannot be removed surgically, made it hard for her to study at first. "I could only study for an hour and then rest for another hour. It was very difficult." Dr Tarek Zobier, a neurologist in Sudan, said the medical implications of having shrapnel lodged in the head vary from case to case. Some people will experience no symptoms and can live without medical intervention. But if more severe symptoms, such as spasms, are experienced, surgery may be required. For Makarem, the pain is no longer consistent, although it gets worse in winter when it's cold. She relies on painkillers when needed. She's decided to repeat her school year so she can retake her exams. "I believe that I will be able to achieve the score I am aiming for. "I am hopeful for the future," she says.

'I didn't hear from my son for seven months': Inside Yemen's UAE-run secret prisons The BBC has been given access to detention facilities on former United Arab Emirates military bases in Yemen, confirming long-standing allegations of a network of secret prisons run by the UAE and forces allied to it in Yemen's decade-long civil war. One former detainee told the BBC he had been beaten and sexually abused at one of the sites. We saw cells at two bases in the south of the country, including shipping containers with names - apparently of detainees - and dates scratched into the sides. The UAE did not respond to our request for comment, but has previously denied similar allegations. Until recently, the Yemeni government, which is backed by Saudi Arabia, was allied with the UAE against the Houthi rebel movement which controls north-west Yemen. But the alliance between Yemen's two Gulf state partners has fractured. UAE forces pulled out of Yemen in early January and Yemeni government forces and groups allied to them have retaken large swathes of the south from separatists backed by the UAE. This includes the port of Mukalla, where we landed in a Saudi military plane and were taken to visit the former UAE military bases in the Al-Dhaba Oil Export Area. It has been almost impossible for international journalists to get visas to report from Yemen in recent years, but the government invited reporters to view the two sites, accompanied by Yemen's Information Minister Moammar al-Eryani. What we saw was consistent with accounts we have gathered independently, both in our previous reporting and also interviews conducted in Yemen, separately from the government-run site visit. 'No space to lie down' At one site, there were about 10 shipping containers, their interiors painted black, with little ventilation. Messages on the walls appeared to mark the dates detainees said they were brought in, or to count the number of days they had been held. Several were dated as recently as December 2025. At another military base, the BBC was shown eight cells built from brick and cement, including several measuring about one metre square and two metres tall, which Eryani said were used for solitary confinement. Human rights groups have documented testimony describing such facilities for years. Yemeni lawyer Huda al-Sarari has been gathering accounts. The BBC independently attended a meeting she organised, where about 70 people were present who said they had been held in Mukalla, as well as the families of another 30 who they said their relatives were still in detention. Several former detainees told us that each shipping container could hold up to 60 men at a time. They said prisoners were blindfolded, bound at the wrists and forced to remain sitting upright at all hours. "There was no space to lie down," one former prisoner told the BBC. "If someone collapsed, the others had to hold him up." 'All types of torture' The man also told the BBC he was beaten for three days after his arrest, with interrogators demanding he confess to being a member of al-Qaeda - an accusation he denies. "They told me if I didn't admit it, I would be sent to 'Guantanamo'," he said, referring to the US military detention centre at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. "I didn't even know what they meant by Guantanamo until they took me to their prison. Then I understood." He said he was held there for a year and a half, beaten daily and abused. "They didn't even feed us properly," he said. "If you wanted the toilet, they took you once. Sometimes you were so desperate you did it on yourself." He says his captors included Emirati soldiers as well as Yemeni fighters: "All types of torture - when we were interrogated it was the worst. They even sexually abused us and said they would bring in the 'doctor'. "This so-called doctor was Emirati. He beat us and told the Yemeni soldiers to beat us too. I tried to kill myself multiple times to make it end." The UAE was leading a counter-terror campaign in southern Yemen, but human rights groups say thousands of people were detained in crackdowns on political activists and critics. A mother told us her son was detained as a teenager and has been held for nine years. "My son was an athlete," she said. "He had just come back from competing abroad. That day he went to the gym and never came back." "I didn't hear from him for seven months," she said. "Then they let me see him for 10 minutes. I could see all the scars of the torture." She alleged that in the prison at the Emirati-run base, her teenage son was electrocuted, doused with ice-cold water and sexually abused multiple times. She says she attended a hearing in which her son's accusers played a recording of him apparently confessing. "You can hear him being beaten in the background and told what to say," she said. "My son is not a terrorist. You have robbed him of the best years of his life." Testimony and allegations Over the past decade, human rights groups and media organisations - including the BBC and Associated Press - have documented allegations of arbitrary detention, enforced disappearance and torture in detention centres run by the UAE and its allies. Human Rights Watch said in 2017 it had gathered testimonies of detainees held without charge or judicial oversight in unofficial facilities, and subjected to beatings, electric shocks and other forms of ill treatment. The UAE denied these allegations when they were made. The BBC sent detailed allegations to the UAE government about the detention sites we visited and accounts of abuse, but received no response. All sides have been accused of human rights violations in the civil war, which has sparked a devastating humanitarian crisis in the country. Families' questions Families of detainees told the BBC they had repeatedly raised concerns with Yemeni authorities. They believe it would have been impossible for the UAE and its allies to run a detention network without the Yemeni government and its Saudi backers knowing about it. The information minister, Eryani, said: "We weren't able to access locations that were under UAE control until now. "When we liberated them we discovered these prisons… we had been told by many victims that they existed but we didn't believe it was true." His government's decision to give access to international media comes as the rift between Saudi Arabia and the UAE is widening. Their long-strained relationship deteriorated in December when UAE-backed southern separatists, the Southern Transition Council (STC), seized territory controlled by government forces in two western provinces. Saudi Arabia then carried out a strike on what it said was a shipment of weapons from the UAE to the STC in Mukalla, and backed a demand from Yemen's presidential council for Emirati forces to leave the country immediately. The UAE withdrew and within days government forces and their allies retook control of the western provinces as well as all of the south. However, remaining separatists threaten the government's position in some places, including the southern port of Aden. The UAE denied that the shipment had contained weapons and also Saudi allegations that it was behind the STC's recent military campaign. Detainees 'still held' On 12 January 2026, the president of Yemen's Presidential Leadership Council, which oversees the government, Rashad al-Alimi, ordered the closure of all "illegal" prisons in southern provinces previously controlled by the STC, demanding the immediate release of those "held outside the framework of the law". Eryani said some detainees had been discovered inside the facilities, but did not give numbers or further details. Some relatives - including the mother of the athlete - told the BBC that detainees have since been transferred to prisons now nominally under government control. Yemeni authorities say transferring prisoners into the formal justice system is complex, while rights groups warn arbitrary detention may simply continue under different control. "The terrorists are out on the streets," the mother said. "Our sons are not terrorists."
