Trump threatens Canada with 100% tariffs if it 'makes a deal with China' US President Donald Trump has threatened to slap a 100% tariff on Canadian goods if the country strikes a trade deal with China. "If Canada makes a deal with China, it will immediately be hit with a 100% Tariff against all Canadian goods and products coming into the U.S.A.," Trump said on Truth Social. It is unclear what deal Trump is referring to in his social media post. Last week, Canada's Prime Minister Carney announced a "strategic partnership" with China, and agreed to reduce tariffs. At the time, Trump called the move "a good thing". But tensions between the US and Canada have grown in recent days, after Carney said in a speech in Davos that the US-led world order had been ruptured. Carney also urged other "middle powers" to band together in the face of economic coercion by "greater powers", though he did not mention Trump by name. Trump responded to the remarks in his own speech the next day, saying: "Canada lives because of the United States." The US president also withdrew an invitation for Canada to join his new Board of Peace. On Saturday, Trump said in his social media post that if Carney "thinks he is going to make Canada a 'Drop Off Port' for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken". The BBC has contacted the White House and Carney's office for comment. Canada's US trade minister Dominic LeBlanc said in a statement: "There is no pursuit of a free trade deal with China." "What was achieved was resolution on several important tariff issues." LeBlanc said the government was focused on building a stronger Canadian economy and strengthening trade partnerships "throughout the world". Canada has been seeking to diversify trade away from the US, its largest trade partner, following the uncertainty caused by Trump's on-again-off-again tariffs. Under the agreement reached between Carney and Chinese President Xi Jinping last week, China will lower levies on Canadian canola oil from 85% to 15% by March, while Canada will tax Chinese EVs at the most-favoured-nation rate, 6.1% – down from 100%. The deal was seen as a breakthrough after years of strained ties and tit-for-tat tariffs, and could see more Chinese investments in Canada. Carney said the progress made with China sets Canada up "well for the new world order".

Trump says UK soldiers in Afghanistan 'among greatest of all warriors' Donald Trump has praised UK soldiers who fought in Afghanistan after his claim that allied forces avoided the front lines prompted criticism from veterans and politicians. Earlier this week Trump angered US allies by downplaying the role of Nato troops in the war and doubted whether the military alliance would be there for the US "if we ever needed them". Trump's words drew condemnation from international allies, while Sir Keir Starmer called them "insulting and frankly appalling". The UK prime minister spoke to Trump on Saturday, after which the US president used his Truth Social platform to praise UK troops as being "among the greatest of all warriors". Trump was criticised for remarks he made during an interview with Fox News on Thursday in which the president said of Nato troops: "We've never needed them. We have never really asked anything of them. "They'll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan... and they did, they stayed a little back, a little off the front lines." That triggered a huge backlash from the families of soldiers who served in Afghanistan, as well as veterans and politicians from across the Westminster and international spectrum who called for Trump to apologise. Prince Harry said the sacrifices of troops needed to be respected as he pointed out Nato's collective security clause had been invoked once - following the 9/11 attacks. In October 2001 the US invaded Afghanistan to oust the Taliban, whom they said were harbouring Osama Bin Laden and other al-Qaeda figures linked to the 9/11 attacks the previous month. Nato nations contributed troops and military equipment to the US-led war. More than 3,500 coalition soldiers died, about two-thirds of them Americans, as of 2021 when the US withdrew from the country. The UK suffered the second-highest number of military deaths in the conflict behind the US, which suffered 2,461 fatalities. On Saturday, Downing Street said the prime minister and US president spoke about the UK's involvement alongside US and Nato forces in the conflict. A spokesperson said: "The prime minister raised the brave and heroic British and American soldiers who fought side by side in Afghanistan, many of whom never returned home. We must never forget their sacrifice". Shortly after the conversation, Trump posted fresh comments on his Truth Social platform - appearing to step back from his critical comments but stopping short of directly apologising for the words he used in Thursday's interview. He wrote: "The great and very brave soldiers of the United Kingdom will always be with the United States of America. "In Afghanistan, 457 died, many were badly injured, and they were among the greatest of all warriors. "It's a bond too strong to ever be broken. The UK military, with tremendous heart and soul, is second to none (except for the USA). We love you all, and always will!" Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said she was pleased Trump had acknowledged the UK's role in fighting alongside the US and Nato allies in Afghanistan. "It should never have been questioned in the first place," she said. On Friday, the Duke of Sussex released a statement in which he praised the contributions of Nato troops who were in Afghanistan. "I served there. I made lifelong friends there. And I lost friends there," the prince said. "In 2001, Nato invoked Article 5 for the first - and only - time in history. It meant that every allied nation was obliged to stand with the United States in Afghanistan, in pursuit of our shared security. Allies answered that call. "Thousands of lives were changed forever. Mothers and fathers buried sons and daughters. Children were left without a parent. Families are left carrying the cost. "Those sacrifices deserve to be spoken about truthfully and with respect, as we all remain united and loyal to the defence of diplomacy and peace." Most of the 457 British troops who died serving in Afghanistan over a period of nearly 20 years were killed in Helmand - the scene of the heaviest fighting. Hundreds more suffered injuries and lost limbs - including Cpl Andy Reid who lost both his legs and his right arm after stepping on an improvised explosive device (IED) in Afghanistan. "Not a day goes by when we're not in some kind of pain, physically or mentally reflecting on that conflict," he told BBC Breakfast on Friday. Reid recalled working with American soldiers, adding: "If they were on the front line and I was stood next to them, clearly we were on the front line as well." Badenoch, Sir Ed Davey and Nigel Farage were among the Westminster leaders to call out the US president for his comments; while outside the UK, ministers from foreign governments also criticised Trump's remarks. Canada's Minister of National Defence David J McGuinty said Canadian "men and women were on the ground from the beginning, not because we had to, but because it was the right thing to do." American political and military figures have also expressed their anger and frustration over Trump's Nato comments. "I think it's insulting to those who were fighting alongside of us," former national security adviser Herbery Raymond McMaster told the BBC. Trump's new comments on Saturday did not mention any of the other Nato allies who sent troops into Afghanistan. Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said her government "was astonished" to hear Trump's first statement and added "our nation paid a cost that is beyond dispute: 53 Italian soldiers killed and more than 700 wounded". She said on X: "For this reason, statements that downplay the contribution of Nato countries in Afghanistan are unacceptable, especially when they come from an allied nation".

**Excerpt**

China places highest-ranking general under investigation China's defence ministry says it has opened an investigation into the country's highest-ranking general over "grave violations of discipline and the law". The ministry gave no further details about accusations against General Zhang Youxia, who has widely been seen as President Xi Jinping's closest military ally. However in China the accusation of wrongdoing is usually a euphemism for corruption. In its announcement, the ministry said another senior military officer, General Liu Zhenli, was also under investigation. Their removal follows the expulsion of nine top generals in October - one of the largest public crackdowns on the military in decades. Zhang, 75, is a vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC) - the Communist Party group headed by President Xi which controls the armed forces. Zhang also sits on the party's top decision-making body, the 24-person Politburo. His father was one of the founding generals of the Chinese Communist Party. Zhang joined the army in 1968 and is one of only a few senior leaders with combat experience. He was kept in office beyond the customary retirement age for China's military, suggesting President Xi's confidence in him until now. The announcement comes days after rumours appeared that Zhang and Liu could be facing an investigation as they were not present at a high-level party event in December. Since coming to power, President Xi has launched waves of anti-corruption drives through various departments and this campaign has recently focused heavily on the military. He has called corruption "the biggest threat" to the Communist Party and said the fight against it "remains grave and complex". Advocates say the policy promotes good governance, but others believe it has been used as a tool to purge political rivals. With the probe into Zhang and Liu, the CMC is now down from the original seven members to just two: Xi, who is the chairman, and Zhang Shengmin, who is responsible for the military's disciplinary affairs.

Climber delays rope-free skyscraper challenge over rain An American climber has postponed scaling the Taipei 101, one of the world's tallest buildings, rope-free for another 24 hours due to wet weather. Alex Honnold, who scaled El Capitan in California's Yosemite National Park without a rope in 2017, said on Saturday: "Sadly it's raining in Taipei right now so I don't get to go climbing." The skyscraper in Taiwan's capital measures 508m (1,667ft) and is made of steel, glass and concrete. It contains eight sections, each with a slight overhang designed to resemble joints on a bamboo stick. Netflix - which will stream the event - says there will be a delay on the live feed should the worst happen. "It's obviously a conversation that everybody has," Netflix executive Jeff Gaspin told Variety magazine. "We'll cut away. We have a 10-second delay. Nobody expects or wants to see anything like that to happen." The climb is now due to take place on Sunday. Announcing the delay, Netflix said: "Safety remains our top priority, and we appreciate your understanding." Taipei 101 has been conquered before. In 2004, France's Alain Robert, who called himself Spiderman, climbed it in four hours using a safety belt and rope. Netflix said there will be three stages to Honnold's rope-free climb. First, there is an initital 113m section of sloping steel and glass followed by the eight "bamboo" boxes before reaching the final stage which includes scaling the spire at the very top of the tower. Honnold, 40, who is married with two children, said it was "a lifelong dream" to scale a skyscraper. His historic 2017 ascent of El Capitan without a rope was documented in the film Free Solo, which won an Academy Award. An enormous sheer granite rock face of approximately 3,000 feet (915m), El Capitan is a major landmark in Yosemite and entices big-wall rock climbers from all over the world.

**Excerpt**

Germany arrests suspected Hamas member over alleged attack plot German police have arrested a Lebanese national on suspicion of being a member of Hamas and planning attacks in Europe. The man, named as "Mohammad S", was stopped at Berlin's Brandenburg Airport after arriving from Beirut on Friday evening. Federal prosecutors said that in August 2025 he helped procure 300 rounds of ammunition and was involved in an alleged plot to attack Jewish and Israeli institutions. He is due to be brought before a federal judge who will decide on a pretrial detention. Hamas, which controlled Gaza but has been severely weakened by Israeli operations in the territory, is considered a terrorist organisation by the US, UK, Israel and many other countries. The militant Palestinian group carried out the attacks on Israel in October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 people taken hostage. Since then, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry, more than 70,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli military action. German authorities say "Mohammad S" colluded with "Abed Al G", one of three alleged Hamas members arrested last October over planned attacks on Jewish and Israeli institutions. The three were reportedly arrested while meeting for a weapons handover in Berlin. Two of them are Germany nationals, another is from Lebanon. Around the time of the arrests, police searches also took place in the German cities of Leipzig and Oberhausen, Der Spiegel reported. Separately, in November, German authorities arrested another suspected member of Hamas - also a Lebanese national - near the border with the Czech Republic.

**Excerpt**

Pentagon to offer 'more limited' support to US allies in defence strategy shift The US will offer "more limited" support to allies, according to the Pentagon's new National Defense Strategy. In a significant shift to its security priorities, the US Department of Defense now considers security of the US homeland and Western Hemisphere - not China - as its primary concern. Previous versions of the strategy - published every four years - named the threat posed by China as the top defence priority. Relations with China will now be approached through "strength, not confrontation", the report says. The defence strategy reinforces recent calls from President Donald Trump, including for greater "burden-sharing" from allies in countering threats posed by Russia and North Korea. The new 34-page report follows last year's publication of the US National Security Strategy, which said Europe faced civilisational collapse and did not cast Russia as a threat to the US. At the time, Moscow said the document was "largely consistent" with its vision. By comparison, in 2018, the Pentagon described "revisionist powers", such as China and Russia, as the "central challenge" to US security. The new strategy calls on American allies to step up, saying partners have been "content" to let Washington subsidise their defence, although it denies the shift signals a US move towards "isolationism". "To the contrary, it means a focused and genuinely strategic approach to the threats our nation faces," it says. Washington has long neglected the "concrete interests" of Americans, the report says, adding the US does not want to conflate American interests "with those of the rest of the world – that a threat to a person halfway around the world is the same as to an American." Instead, it says allies, especially Europe, "will take the lead against threats that are less severe for us but more so for them". Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine nearly four years ago, is described as a "persistent but manageable threat to NATO's eastern members". Unlike in previous versions of the strategy, Taiwan, the self-governing island claimed by China, is not mentioned. However, the document does write that the US aims to "prevent anyone, including China, from being able to dominate us or our allies". Late last year, the US announced a vast arms sale to Taiwan worth $11bn (£8.2bn), leading China to hold military drills around the island in response. The strategy also outlines a "more limited" role for US deterrence of North Korea. South Korea is "capable of taking primary responsibility" for the task, it adds. In the 12 months since Trump began his second term as president, the US has seized Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, carried out strikes against alleged drug boats in the eastern Pacific and Caribbean, and more recently, applied pressure on US allies to acquire Greenland. The strategy reiterates that the Pentagon "will guarantee US military and commercial access to key terrain, especially the Panama Canal, Gulf of America, and Greenland". The document says the Trump administration's approach will be "fundamentally different from the grandiose strategies of the past post–Cold War administrations". It adds: "Out with utopian idealism; in with hardnosed realism." At the World Economic Forum earlier this week, Trump claimed the US had "never gotten anything" from Nato and "we've never asked for anything". He further criticised the organisation, incorrectly claiming "the United States was paying for virtually 100% of Nato". Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said the old world order is "not coming back" and urged fellow middle powers - like South Korea, Canada and Australia - to come together. "Middle powers must act together because if we're not at the table, we're on the menu," Carney said at the Davos meeting. That came as French President Emmanuel Macron also warned of a "shift towards a world without rules".

Boy, 12, dies from injuries after Sydney shark attack A young boy who was bitten by a shark in Sydney Harbour last week has died in hospital. Twelve-year-old Nico Antic had been jumping off a rock ledge with friends on 18 January when he was attacked by what authorities suspected was a bull shark. "We are heartbroken to share that our son, Nico has passed away," his parents Lorena and Juan said in a statement. The incident was one of four reported shark attacks along the New South Wales coast over two days. "Nico was a happy, friendly, and sporty young boy with the most kind and generous spirit. He was always full of life and that's how we'll remember him," his family, who were originally from Argentina, added. Nico's friends were praised for their bravery after jumping into the water to help him after he was attacked last Sunday afternoon. However he suffered serious leg injuries and was taken to Sydney Children's Hospital in a critical condition. He was placed in an induced coma after undergoing surgery. An online fundraiser set up for Nico's family has raised $240,000 (£121,308). There has been a spate of reported shark attacks along Australia's east coast in the past week, three of them in Sydney. On Monday, a surfer on Sydney's northern beaches escaped a lurking shark without physical injury, while hours later a 27-year-old man suffered "life-changing" injuries in a shark attack at a nearby beach. One day later, a man on the Mid North Coast of New South Wales was pulled from the water after surviving a shark bite. The man, 39, sustained a chest wound and was taken to hospital. The attacks followed several days of heavy rain, which experts say created a "perfect storm" of conditions for bull sharks who prefer murky water. They also say rain flushes nutrients into the water, which can draw sharks closer to shore. Beaches across Sydney were closed to protect the public until weather improved, many of which have reopened for the Australia Day public holiday long weekend.

**Excerpt**

How Soviet urban planning is helping Russia freeze Ukraine Ukraine is now living through its most difficult winter in recent memory. With January temperatures plummeting below -15C, Russia has been attacking energy infrastructure, leaving about a million Ukrainians without heating. The capital, Kyiv, is the main target of such attacks. Following the latest Russian bombardment overnight into 24 January, almost 6,000 apartment blocks were left without heating, according to mayor Vitaly Klitschko. This is the third such Russian attack targeting Kyiv's heating infrastructure in little more than two weeks, after strikes on 9 and 20 January also left hundreds of thousands freezing in their flats. "Living in Kyiv is a bit of a gamble these days," one resident of the Ukrainian capital, Rita, told the BBC. "If you have heating and gas, there is no electricity and water. If you have electricity and water, there is no heating. "Coming home is like playing a guessing game every day - will I be able to shower or have hot tea, or neither? And of course missiles and drones come on top of all that." She says she has to go to bed wearing a hat and several layers of clothing. What is making things much worse for Ukraine and easier for Russia is the widespread prevalence of apartment blocks that rely on communal central heating - where water is heated up elsewhere and then pumped into their radiators. Heating plants in Ukraine are huge and many thousands of people are affected when they are targeted by Russian forces. Ukraine says that all such power plants have now been hit. Such attacks also disrupt electricity supplies, but while a generator or battery pack might help in this situation, heating is less straightforward - especially when there is also no electricity to power your heater. Kyivteploenergo, the monopoly supplying heating and hot water in the Ukrainian capital, told the BBC "the absolute majority" of houses in Kyiv rely on its services. It said it could not share the exact number for security reasons. In Zaporizhzhia, a frontline city home to 750,000 people, almost three-quarters of residents rely on central heating, according to Maksym Rohalsky, the head of the local association of apartment block dwellers. Before Russia's full-scale invasion of 2022, about 11 million households in Ukraine relied on central heating, compared to seven million autonomously heated households, Ukrainian energy expert Yuriy Korolchuk said. Cities across the Soviet Union, including in Ukraine, were the focus of huge construction programmes launched in the 1950s to mass produce cheap housing. The landscapes of cities in the former USSR are dominated by ubiquitous nine-storey residential buildings made from pre-fabricated concrete panels, known as "panelki", or smaller five-storey blocks of flats known as "khrushchevki", after Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, who oversaw their construction in the 1950s and 1960s. Heating to such houses is supplied by large plants known as TETs - an acronym that stands for "heat and electricity centrals" in Ukrainian as they generate electricity as well as heat. Detached houses occupied by a single family, known as "private houses" in Ukraine, are normally found in rural areas and are rare in cities. "Ukraine inherited the Soviet heating system and it hasn't changed anything, it stays predominantly centralised," Korolchuk told the BBC. "These heating plants were not designed to be attacked with missiles or drones, that's why these vulnerabilities came to the fore during the war." According to him, this is a new tactic used by Russia. "During the previous winters, there were no such strikes against the heating system. They happened only occasionally, and they didn't directly target heating plants," he added. Referring to ongoing talks to end the war, he says "the factor of negotiations is now possibly playing a role, it's a form of pressure". Large centralised installations bring about efficiencies of scale, but should they be targeted by bombs or drones, the consequences can be devastating for hundreds of thousands of people. The Ukrainian government is acutely aware of this vulnerability, and is planning to reduce it by making individual heating points mandatory at apartment blocks. However, undoing decades of Soviet urban planning will not be quick or easy.
