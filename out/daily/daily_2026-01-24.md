Ukraine condemns 'brutal' Russian strikes ahead of second day of peace talks Ukraine has condemned a fresh wave of Russian strikes overnight which killed one person and injured 23 others, as talks with the US aimed at ending the war are set to resume. Ukraine's Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said the "brutal" attack had "hit not only our people, but also the negotiation table". Delegations from Russia, Ukraine and the US have been meeting in Abu Dhabi for the first trilateral talks since the Kremlin launched a full-scale invasion of its neighbour in 2022. A source told the BBC that some progress had been made but the key issue of territory remains unresolved. The mayor of Ukrainian capital Kyiv said one person had died and four had been wounded while Kharkiv's mayor reported that 19 people had been hurt during a sustained assault on the city in the early hours of Saturday morning. On the second day of the three-way talks in Abu Dhabi, Sybiha said the "barbaric" overnight assault proved "that Putin's place is not at the board of peace, but at the dock of the special tribunal". US President Donald Trump said last week that Russian leader Vladimir Putin had accepted an invitation to join his 'Board of Peace' - an organisation focused on ending global conflicts. Putin has not confirmed this. Kyiv's mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Telegram that three of the four people who had been injured had been hospitalised. He added that the capital's critical infrastructure had been damaged, leaving 6,000 buildings without heating. Temperatures in Ukraine are at sub-zero levels and in a statement following the assaults, President Volodymyr Zelensky said: "The main target of the Russians was the energy infrastructure." In Kharkiv, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said 19 people had been injured during the strikes in the early hours of Saturday morning. A maternity hospital and a hostel for displaced people were damaged. Russia occupies roughly 20% of Ukraine, including parts of the eastern Donbas region. The Kremlin wants Ukraine to hand over large areas of the territory. Ukraine has ruled this out. Following the first day of talks, Rustem Umerov, who is leading the Ukrainian delegation, said on social media: "The meeting focused on the parameters for ending Russia's war and the further logic of the negotiation process aimed at advancing toward a dignified and lasting peace."

Pentagon to offer 'more limited' support to US allies in defence strategy shift The US will offer "more limited" support to its allies, according to the Pentagon's new National Defense Strategy. In a significant shift to its security priorities, the US Department of Defense now considers security of the US homeland and Western Hemisphere - not China - as its primary concern. By comparison, previous versions of the defence strategy - published once every four years - named the "multi-domain threat" posed by China as the top defence priority for the US. The new strategy reinforces recent comments made by US President Donald Trump, including calls for greater "burden-sharing" from US allies in countering threats posed by Russia and North Korea. The new 34-page report follows last year's publication of the US National Security Strategy, which said Europe faced civilisational collapse and did not cast Russia as a threat to the US. At the time, Moscow said the document was "largely consistent" with its vision. By comparison, in 2018, the Pentagon described "revisionist powers", such as China and Russia, as the "central challenge" to US security. The new strategy calls on American allies to step up, saying partners have been "content" to let Washington subsidise their defence, although it denies the shift signals a US move towards "isolationism". "To the contrary, it means a focused and genuinely strategic approach to the threats our nation faces," it says. Washington has long neglected the "concrete interests" of Americans, the report says, adding the US does not want to conflate American interests "with those of the rest of the world – that a threat to a person halfway around the world is the same as to an American." Instead, it says allies, especially Europe, "will take the lead against threats that are less severe for us but more so for them". Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine nearly four years ago, is described as a "persistent but manageable threat to NATO's eastern members". Relations with China are to be approached through "strength, not confrontation", the report says. The goal "is not to dominate China; nor is it to strangle or humiliate them". Unlike in previous versions of the strategy, Taiwan, the self-governing island claimed by China, is not mentioned. However, the document does write that the US aims to "prevent anyone, including China, from being able to dominate us or our allies". Late last year, the US announced a vast arms sale to Taiwan worth $11bn (£8.2bn), leading China to hold military drills around the island in response. The strategy also outlines a "more limited" role for US deterrence of North Korea. South Korea is "capable of taking primary responsibility" for the task, it adds. In the 12 months since Trump began his second term as president, the US has seized Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, carried out strikes against alleged drug boats in the eastern Pacific and Caribbean, and more recently, applied pressure on US allies to acquire Greenland. The strategy reiterates that the Pentagon "will guarantee US military and commercial access to key terrain, especially the Panama Canal, Gulf of America, and Greenland". The document says the Trump administration's approach will be "fundamentally different from the grandiose strategies of the past post–Cold War administrations". It adds: "Out with utopian idealism; in with hardnosed realism." At the World Economic Forum earlier this week, Trump claimed the US had "never gotten anything" from Nato and "we've never asked for anything". He further criticised the organisation, incorrectly claiming "the United States was paying for virtually 100% of Nato". Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said the old world order is "not coming back" and urged fellow middle powers - like South Korea, Canada and Australia - to come together. "Middle powers must act together because if we're not at the table, we're on the menu," Carney said at the Davos meeting. That came as French President Emmanuel Macron also warned of a "shift towards a world without rules".

Boy, 12, dies from injuries after Sydney shark attack A young boy who was bitten by a shark in Sydney Harbour last week has died in hospital. Twelve-year-old Nico Antic had been jumping off a rock ledge with friends on 18 January when he was attacked by what authorities suspected was a bull shark. "We are heartbroken to share that our son, Nico has passed away," his parents Lorena and Juan said in a statement. The incident was one of four reported shark attacks along the New South Wales coast over two days. "Nico was a happy, friendly, and sporty young boy with the most kind and generous spirit. He was always full of life and that's how we'll remember him," his family, who were originally from Argentina, added. Nico's friends were praised for their bravery after jumping into the water to help him after he was attacked last Sunday afternoon. However he suffered serious leg injuries and was taken to Sydney Children's Hospital in a critical condition. He was placed in an induced coma after undergoing surgery. An online fundraiser set up for Nico's family has raised $240,000 (£121,308). There has been a spate of reported shark attacks along Australia's east coast in the past week, three of them in Sydney. On Monday, a surfer on Sydney's northern beaches escaped a lurking shark without physical injury, while hours later a 27-year-old man suffered "life-changing" injuries in a shark attack at a nearby beach. One day later, a man on the Mid North Coast of New South Wales was pulled from the water after surviving a shark bite. The man, 39, sustained a chest wound and was taken to hospital. The attacks followed several days of heavy rain, which experts say created a "perfect storm" of conditions for bull sharks who prefer murky water. They also say rain flushes nutrients into the water, which can draw sharks closer to shore. Beaches across Sydney were closed to protect the public until weather improved, many of which have reopened for the Australia Day public holiday long weekend.

### 4. [TikTok US venture to collect precise user location data](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgnj7v2rr5o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

TikTok US venture to collect precise user location data TikTok's new US joint venture has made changes to its privacy policy that include expanding the type of location data the company can collect from its 200 million American users. The new policy was published after investors closed a deal with TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance on Thursday to run the popular short-form video app's business in the US. The new joint venture said in its updated privacy terms that it may now "collect precise location data, depending on your settings" - a change from the previous policy which allowed for the collection of "approximate" location data. TikTok did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment on the change. The company policy added that the sensitive personal information would be processed "in accordance with applicable law" and that users can turn off location services in their device settings at any time. Even before the new venture was established, TikTok collected location information based on a user's SIM card or IP address, or both. But it stopped short of collecting even approximate GPS information from American users operating the most updated version of the app, according to a 2024 version of its privacy policy. Precise location sharing hasn't yet been enabled in the US, where it is expected to be optional and turned off by default so users will be asked to opt in with a pop-up message. TikTok has not said when the update is due to reach American users. TikTok already collects similar data from users in the UK and Europe as part of a new "Nearby Feed" feature that lets users find events and businesses near them. The new American TikTok joint venture is also extending its permissions for gathering information about users interactions with TikTok's artificial intelligence (AI) tools. This includes prompts and questions submitted by users, as well as information about how, when, and where AI content was prompted or created. TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC is comprised of three managing investors including cloud computing giant Oracle, which is investing heavily in AI infrastructure and has taken on significant debt to finance its ambitions in the burgeoning space. Oracle is chaired by Larry Ellison, a Republican megadonor and longtime ally of US President Donald Trump, whose administration helped broker the US TikTok deal. The agreement follows years of tussling between Washington and Beijing that began in Trump's first presidential term, when he tried unsuccessfully to ban the app over national security concerns. In 2024, the US passed a law that required the platform to be banned in the US by January 2025 if ByteDance failed to sell its US operations to American investors. Trump repeatedly postponed the enforcement of legislation until the joint venture was finalised this week. The 2024 law was prompted in part by concerns about the possibility that Beijing might access the data of TikTok's American users. In a statement onThursday, the new joint venture said its mandate was "to secure U.S. user data, apps and the algorithm through comprehensive data privacy and cybersecurity measures". Oracle will oversee the retraining of TikTok's powerful content recommendation algorithm on existing American user data, the joint venture said in its statement, adding that the algorithm "will be secured in Oracle's U.S. cloud environment." ByteDance retains a minority stake just shy of 20% in the joint venture. Other managing investors include the US tech investment firm Silver Lake and Abu-Dhabi state-owned investment fund MGX, which has done business with the Trump family's crypto venture World Liberty Financial. On Friday, Republican Representative John Moolenaar, who chairs the House Select Committee on China, expressed concern about ByteDance's ongoing involvement in TikTok's US operations. "Does this deal ensure China does not have influence over the algorithm? Can the parties involved assure Americans their data is secure?" he said in a statement. "Those are questions that need to be answered as the Select Committee does oversight of this deal."

'I didn't hear from my son for seven months': Inside Yemen's UAE-run secret prisons The BBC has been given access to detention facilities on former United Arab Emirates military bases in Yemen, confirming long-standing allegations of a network of secret prisons run by the UAE and forces allied to it in Yemen's decade-long civil war. One former detainee told the BBC he had been beaten and sexually abused at one of the sites. We saw cells at two bases in the south of the country, including shipping containers with names - apparently of detainees - and dates scratched into the sides. The UAE did not respond to our request for comment, but has previously denied similar allegations. Until recently, the Yemeni government, which is backed by Saudi Arabia, was allied with the UAE against the Houthi rebel movement which controls north-west Yemen. But the alliance between Yemen's two Gulf state partners has fractured. UAE forces pulled out of Yemen in early January and Yemeni government forces and groups allied to them have retaken large swathes of the south from separatists backed by the UAE. This includes the port of Mukalla, where we landed in a Saudi military plane and were taken to visit the former UAE military bases in the Al-Dhaba Oil Export Area. It has been almost impossible for international journalists to get visas to report from Yemen in recent years, but the government invited reporters to view the two sites, accompanied by Yemen's Information Minister Moammar al-Eryani. What we saw was consistent with accounts we have gathered independently, both in our previous reporting and also interviews conducted in Yemen, separately from the government-run site visit. 'No space to lie down' At one site, there were about 10 shipping containers, their interiors painted black, with little ventilation. Messages on the walls appeared to mark the dates detainees said they were brought in, or to count the number of days they had been held. Several were dated as recently as December 2025. At another military base, the BBC was shown eight cells built from brick and cement, including several measuring about one metre square and two metres tall, which Eryani said were used for solitary confinement. Human rights groups have documented testimony describing such facilities for years. Yemeni lawyer Huda al-Sarari has been gathering accounts. The BBC independently attended a meeting she organised, where about 70 people were present who said they had been held in Mukalla, as well as the families of another 30 who they said their relatives were still in detention. Several former detainees told us that each shipping container could hold up to 60 men at a time. They said prisoners were blindfolded, bound at the wrists and forced to remain sitting upright at all hours. "There was no space to lie down," one former prisoner told the BBC. "If someone collapsed, the others had to hold him up." 'All types of torture' The man also told the BBC he was beaten for three days after his arrest, with interrogators demanding he confess to being a member of al-Qaeda - an accusation he denies. "They told me if I didn't admit it, I would be sent to 'Guantanamo'," he said, referring to the US military detention centre at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. "I didn't even know what they meant by Guantanamo until they took me to their prison. Then I understood." He said he was held there for a year and a half, beaten daily and abused. "They didn't even feed us properly," he said. "If you wanted the toilet, they took you once. Sometimes you were so desperate you did it on yourself." He says his captors included Emirati soldiers as well as Yemeni fighters: "All types of torture - when we were interrogated it was the worst. They even sexually abused us and said they would bring in the 'doctor'. "This so-called doctor was Emirati. He beat us and told the Yemeni soldiers to beat us too. I tried to kill myself multiple times to make it end." The UAE was leading a counter-terror campaign in southern Yemen, but human rights groups say thousands of people were detained in crackdowns on political activists and critics. A mother told us her son was detained as a teenager and has been held for nine years. "My son was an athlete," she said. "He had just come back from competing abroad. That day he went to the gym and never came back." "I didn't hear from him for seven months," she said. "Then they let me see him for 10 minutes. I could see all the scars of the torture." She alleged that in the prison at the Emirati-run base, her teenage son was electrocuted, doused with ice-cold water and sexually abused multiple times. She says she attended a hearing in which her son's accusers played a recording of him apparently confessing. "You can hear him being beaten in the background and told what to say," she said. "My son is not a terrorist. You have robbed him of the best years of his life." Testimony and allegations Over the past decade, human rights groups and media organisations - including the BBC and Associated Press - have documented allegations of arbitrary detention, enforced disappearance and torture in detention centres run by the UAE and its allies. Human Rights Watch said in 2017 it had gathered testimonies of detainees held without charge or judicial oversight in unofficial facilities, and subjected to beatings, electric shocks and other forms of ill treatment. The UAE denied these allegations when they were made. The BBC sent detailed allegations to the UAE government about the detention sites we visited and accounts of abuse, but received no response. All sides have been accused of human rights violations in the civil war, which has sparked a devastating humanitarian crisis in the country. Families' questions Families of detainees told the BBC they had repeatedly raised concerns with Yemeni authorities. They believe it would have been impossible for the UAE and its allies to run a detention network without the Yemeni government and its Saudi backers knowing about it. The information minister, Eryani, said: "We weren't able to access locations that were under UAE control until now. "When we liberated them we discovered these prisons… we had been told by many victims that they existed but we didn't believe it was true." His government's decision to give access to international media comes as the rift between Saudi Arabia and the UAE is widening. Their long-strained relationship deteriorated in December when UAE-backed southern separatists, the Southern Transition Council (STC), seized territory controlled by government forces in two western provinces. Saudi Arabia then carried out a strike on what it said was a shipment of weapons from the UAE to the STC in Mukalla, and backed a demand from Yemen's presidential council for Emirati forces to leave the country immediately. The UAE withdrew and within days government forces and their allies retook control of the western provinces as well as all of the south. However, remaining separatists threaten the government's position in some places, including the southern port of Aden. The UAE denied that the shipment had contained weapons and also Saudi allegations that it was behind the STC's recent military campaign. Detainees 'still held' On 12 January 2026, the president of Yemen's Presidential Leadership Council, which oversees the government, Rashad al-Alimi, ordered the closure of all "illegal" prisons in southern provinces previously controlled by the STC, demanding the immediate release of those "held outside the framework of the law". Eryani said some detainees had been discovered inside the facilities, but did not give numbers or further details. Some relatives - including the mother of the athlete - told the BBC that detainees have since been transferred to prisons now nominally under government control. Yemeni authorities say transferring prisoners into the formal justice system is complex, while rights groups warn arbitrary detention may simply continue under different control. "The terrorists are out on the streets," the mother said. "Our sons are not terrorists."

US braces for 'extremely dangerous' winter storm More than 200 million Americans are expected to face an unusually brutal winter storm starting Friday, with heavy snows and freezing rains forecast. The storm is expected to sweep through much of the United States, leaving "extremely dangerous" conditions in its wake as it tracks eastwards from the High Plains and Rockies, the National Weather Service (NWS) said. It warned that the Arctic blast will bring sub-zero temperatures and wind chills, which "pose a life-threatening risk of hypothermia and frostbite to exposed skin". US transportation officials, including airport authorities in several major cities, have warned of weekend travel disruption, delays and cancellations. What is the storm's predicted path? The winter storm is forecast to move slowly across the US, blanketing cities including Memphis, Nashville, Washington DC, Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York with snow. Heavy snow is predicted through the Southern Rockies and Plains, into the Mid-Atlantic and reaching the Northeast. According to the NWS Probabilistic Precipitation Portal, the regions that could see more than a foot of snow stretch from Colorado to West Virginia to Boston. Parts of northeast New Jersey and southeast New York, including New York City, could see between 10 and 14 inches of snow starting early on Sunday and lasting through Monday, the NWS predicts. And windchills as low as -10F (-23C) are expected for the same region from Friday evening to Saturday afternoon, the service says. Most of southern New England, including Boston, can expect between 12 and 17 inches of snow and wind gusts up to 30mph from Sunday into Monday, NWS says. Wind chill temperatures there could reach -15F (-26C) Friday into Saturday. Numerous low temperature records are likely to be broken, according to the NWS, with the coldest wind chills potentially falling below -50F (-46C) across the Northern Plains. A much wider area of the south-eastern US is also forecast to experience freezing temperatures. Parts of North Texas were already seeing sleet and ice on Friday night. How are states preparing for the storm? Governors in several US states, including Arkansas, Georgia, Texas, North Carolina, South Carolina, have declared states of emergency, allowing emergency officials - including National Guard troops - to begin mobilising response efforts. In a press conference on Friday, New York Governor Kathy Hochul said the state has over 1,600 snow plows and 114,000 tonnes of salt on hand for the storm, which she said will leave no corner of the state "immune from feeling the effect of Mother Nature's wrath". Hochul urged residents to work from home, stock up on groceries and essentials ahead of time and be careful when shoveling snow, which can increase the risk of a heart attack. New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani said Friday the city will be deploying thousands of sanitation workers this weekend, 700 salt spreaders and 2,200 snow plows once two inches of snow have accumulated. While subways and buses will be operational this weekend, he urged New Yorkers to stay home if they can. Texas Governor Greg Abbott said Thursday there's "no expectation whatsoever" that the state's power grid will fail, as it did during a major storm in 2021 which led to hundreds of deaths in the state. There may be some local power outages due to falling ice and snow, he said, but stressed that this would be different from a large-scale grid failure. "The local power providers have never been more prepared for any winter storm ever," Abbott said. In total, 16 states were under a state of emergency on Friday ahead of the storm. Some airlines have offered passengers the option to change their flights, in some cases without incurring extra fees, due to concerns about cancellations. More than 3,200 flights within, into or out of the US have already been cancelled for Saturday, as well as over 4,800 for Sunday, according to flight tracker FlightAware. Motorists should avoid driving across the weekend, with travel expected to be "nearly impossible during the peak of the storm", NWS meteorologists Rich Otto and Tony Fracasso told the BBC's US news partner CBS. Meanwhile in Canada, freezing temperatures are already gripping the country, with snowfall expected in eastern and Atlantic regions on Monday, meteorologist Geoff Coulson told CBC earlier in the week. Even after the storm passes through the US this weekend, a strong arctic air mass originating in Canada will keep temperatures frigid in the eastern US into next week, according to the NWS Weather Prediction Center.

### 7. [Hundreds of Minnesota businesses close to protest ICE presence](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1dk67g4q91o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

Hundreds of Minnesota businesses close to protest ICE presence Hundreds of businesses in Minnesota closed on Friday and thousands of protesters turned out in severely cold weather to demonstrate against the ongoing immigration crackdown in the state. The widespread rallies come after organisers encouraged residents to skip work or school and refrain from shopping in a show of opposition to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The ICE operation ordered by the Trump administration in Minnesota has been going on for more than six weeks. The administration has characterised it as a public safety operation aimed at deporting criminals illegally in the country. Critics warn migrants with no criminal record and US citizens are being detained too. On Friday, about 100 clergy members were arrested at the Minneapolis airport while holding a protest calling on US airlines to refuse to transport detainees arrested by ICE. A spokesman for the airports commission told the Minnesota Reformer that the arrests took place after the "permitted activity went beyond agreed upon terms" and was to done to protect the public safety and airport access. Thousands of federal officers have been deployed to Minnesota as part of "Operation Metro Surge". The killing of 37-year-old Minneapolis woman Renee Good earlier this month flared tensions across the state and brought condemnation from local officials. "We want ICE out of Minnesota, and we want ICE out of every state, with their extreme overreach," said Bishop Dwayne Royster, whose organisation Faith in Action is supporting local partners in Minneapolis during the strike. "We want Congress to stand up and provide oversight to ICE." Friday's marches are thought to be the largest display of opposition to date to the current immigration policy in the state, as thousands of people walked downtown through temperatures of -23C (-10F). As they made their way to the city's NBA arena to hold an anti-ICE rally, taking place on the home court of the Minnesota Timberwolves, protesters chanted and played music. On Friday morning, Minneapolis resident Corey Lamb closed his business, Harriet Grove Botanicals, in solidarity and headed to a protest. He objected to the presence of ICE agents in his city, and was outraged by Good's death in early January. He also saw the immigration raids as an economic threat to his business, and others in his community. "We have a lot of friends that we rely on, we have a lot of businesses that we rely on, in order to make our business work," Lamb told the BBC. "When those individuals are struggling because they're afraid of being detained or disappeared, it has an effect not only morally but economically on what's going on here, and also in the greater Midwest." Lamb's business was joined by hundreds of others, from restaurants and tattoo parlours to toy stores. Kim Bartmann is the owner of six restaurants in Minneapolis, including four that remain open in the winter but that she shut on Friday. While she supports the cause, she said the decision to participate had been a tricky one, given the costs. "Everyone is in solidarity, but everyone needs to buy groceries and pay their rents," she said, noting that staff at one of her locations had initially asked to stay open, before deciding the risk of backlash over not participating would be too great. "Economically, it is a severe blow to my business," she said. She said sales at her restaurants, which include Barbette and Gigi's Café, have already dropped more than 30% over the past three weeks as a result of the ICE operation, which has prompted her to limit her opening hours as customers and staff stay home. "We have a lot of employees who are US citizens or have paperwork to work in the US who are still terrified to leave their homes," she said. ICE's presence has outraged many of Minnesota's residents, who have protested against their operations and other federal officers operating in their city. This week, school officials in the suburb of Columbia Heights announced that four of their students had been detained by ICE, ranging from ages five to 17. A two-year-old child was also detained on Thursday alongside her undocumented father while returning home from a grocery store in south Minneapolis, according to CBS News, the BBC's US partner. In a speech on Thursday, Vice-President JD Vance called for local Minnesota law enforcement to coordinate with federal officers to carry out immigration enforcement. Minnesota, and some of its cities, have so-called "sanctuary" policies, which limit the ways that local government and law enforcement cooperates with ICE. The Trump administration has criticised these policies as a threat to public safety. Meanwhile, a Minneapolis FBI agent resigned this week over concerns about the bureau's handling of the investigation into Good's shooting, CBS News, the BBC's US partner, reported. The New York Times was first to report the resignation. Tracee Mergen left "in part due to the pressure on her to reclassify/discontinue the investigation" over Good's death, CBS News reported, citing sources. The BBC has contacted the FBI for comment. Earlier this month, US media reported that at least six prosecutors in the Minneapolis US Attorney's office resigned over the administration's handling of the federal investigation.

'A natural partner': US treasury secretary weighs in on Alberta separatism US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has weighed in on a separatist movement in Alberta, saying the western Canadian province is a "natural partner for the US". "Alberta has a wealth of natural resources, but they won't let them build a pipeline to the Pacific," Bessent told an American right-wing commentator in an interview on Thursday. "I think we should let them come down into the US, and Alberta is a natural partner for the US. They have great resources. The Albertans are very independent people." The top US official's comments come amid strained ties between US and Canada, and as signatures are being collected in the province seeking an independence referendum. In comments to conservative host Jack Posobiec, Bessent went on to say there is a "rumour that they may have a referendum on whether they want to stay in Canada or not". A group in Alberta has until May to collect at least 178,000 signatures - or 10% of eligible voters - for a referendum campaign. Asked about Bessent's remarks on Friday, federal Finance Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said he'd tell him "thanks but no thanks, we will do our own things". He said Canadians are "able to develop our natural resources at home" and pointed to a deal recently inked by Prime Minister Mark Carney with Alberta that opens the door for an oil pipeline to the Pacific. It's a project long pushed for by Canada's oil heartland but one which faces significant hurdles. A spokesman for Alberta Premier Danielle Smith said in a statement to the BBC that the province supports new pipelines "west, east, north, and south, and we will continue to work with our US partners on building more pipeline capacity to US markets". "But the premier also believes the overwhelming majority of Albertans are not interested in becoming a US state". Late last year over 430,000 signatures were gathered for a petition calling for a united Canada to counter the separatist push, and polls indicate a majority of Albertans want to stay in Canada. Many supporters of separatism have also told media they are seeking independence from Canada - not to join the US. Mitch Sylvestre, who is spearheading the referendum petition, told the CBC on Friday he doesn't think anyone in his movement is eyeing the US. He said he thought Bessent's comment on Alberta and the US being "natural partners" was obvious given the energy trade between them. Still, some organisers of the movement have said they have travelled to Washington to meet officials from the Trump administration. Meanwhile, trade talks between the US and Canada are on ice, and President Donald Trump has expressed irritation with the prime minister over a blunt speech he delivered at the World Economic Forum in Davos calling out "great powers" for weaponising their economic might. Trump responded in his own speech with: "Canada lives because of the United States. Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements." Other US officials have also criticised Carney's speech, including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who this week accused Canada of being "arrogant" and Carney of pandering to a domestic audience by adopting an anti-US stance.

'I saw people getting shot': Eyewitness tells of Iran protest crackdown Warning: This story contains details which some readers might find distressing. An Iranian woman who witnessed the bloody crackdown on protests in Iran has described how her neighbourhood turned into a "war zone" as security forces opened fire at crowds with live ammunition. A government-imposed internet blackout in Iran, now in its third week, has prevented many accounts of what has happened from reaching the wider world. But some Iranians who have left the country have been able to share what they have seen. Parnia, who lives in London, told the BBC that she was visiting her family in the central city of Isfahan when the protests broke out in the capital, Tehran. They quickly spread across the country, and within days there were hundreds of protesters in the Hakim Nezami and Khaghani neighbourhoods of Isfahan. "There were women and men from seven to 70 years old," she said. "On just one street there were 200 to 300 people. People were chanting 'Death to the dictator' and 'Long live the shah'." The "dictator" was Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and the shah a reference to Iran's late last monarch, overthrown in the 1979 Islamic revolution, and his son, the exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi. Isfahan has seen protests and crackdowns down the years. But Parnia said she had never seen anything like what happened during the recent unrest, which was sparked by anger over the collapse of the Iranian currency. First, security forces fired tear gas at the protesters, she said. Then they formed a line and fired birdshot. "I saw people getting shot and falling down, and I saw blood on the street." Parnia said she ran away down alleyways and was suddenly pulled into an apartment block by a woman. Inside, she said, were many injured protesters. "I saw the lobby floor covered in blood, and I saw a girl whose leg was full of pellets." Videos verified by the BBC from that night show large numbers of people in the streets in Isfahan. Some streets were blocked by traffic sign poles and large metal sheets, in an apparent effort by protesters to protect themselves from gunfire. Footage also showed protesters breaking through the gates of the building of the national broadcaster Irib, which was later set on fire. On Friday morning, 9 January, Khamenei said Iran would not back down from dealing with what he called "destructive elements", a day after US President Donald Trump had threatened to hit Iran "very hard" if authorities started killing people. Following Khamenei's speech, the powerful Revolutionary Guards sent a text message to people across Iran, telling them to avoid gatherings on streets in areas of unrest. The messages also warned against co-operating with what it described as "terrorist mercenaries" - an act it said would constitute treason. Despite the risks, Parnia went out to protest again on Friday evening. "The protesters were hopeful," she said. "You could see fear on everyone's faces. We were afraid to pass in front of the security forces and come closer together," she said. "We thought even if we get killed, it would be a reason for Trump to act faster." Footage obtained by the BBC from the previous day shows large crowds on main streets in Parnia's neighbourhood. But she said on the Friday it was different. "Protesters were in small groups gathered in alleyways. Every time that someone tried to gather in the larger street, we could hear live fire sound followed by screams and shouts." Because of the internet blackouts, and protesters avoiding taking their phones with them, the BBC has not yet obtained footage from Friday night. Parnia also described a scene of "total chaos" at a local clinic that was treating wounded protesters. "No phone lines were working. Nobody could call their families, and many refused to go to hospitals, fearing they could be arrested there," she said. "All the nurses could do was clean the wounds and send them home. The next day you could still smell the tear gasses in the air. Security forces were present and there were checkpoints across the city." Parnia left Isfahan that same day and travelled to the capital, Tehran, to catch a flight back to London. "I arrived in Tehran at 6pm. All the shops were closed and many people gathered in the streets. At 8pm everyone started to chant and I could hear gunshots," she said. "The airport was so busy. Many foreign airlines were cancelled and people were frustrated. Luckily, I found an Iranian flight to leave." Since her return to the UK, Parnia has been in touch with her friends in Isfahan. She said she learned from a source that doctors at Feiz eye hospital in Isfahan had carried out around 300 surgical procedures to remove the eyes of patients with birdshot-related facial injuries. "Every time you go out into the streets, you see random people with eye patches," Parnia's friends told her. According to several health workers who spoke to the BBC, hospitals are monitored and controlled by security forces, and people with gunshot wounds in Isfahan are being arrested. "Many of the injured are developing infections. Some doctors are referring them to surgeons who can treat them in private clinics," Parnia's cited her friends as saying. While Iranian authorities have said around 3,000 people were killed during the protests, US-based human rights group HRANA has so far confirmed more than 4,600 deaths, with another 9,700 cases still under review. According to the group, at least 7,300 people have also sustained serious injuries. Many believe the true figures may be even higher. Parnia said she was now preparing to join Iranian opposition protests in the UK, saying she wants to be a voice for the silenced protesters. She also expressed anger at international media reports suggesting that Iranians and the country's political opposition was not united. "Iranians have shown what they want in the streets and paid a high price for it."

### 10. [Spanish track was fractured before high-speed train disaster, report finds](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1m77dmxlvlo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

Spanish track was fractured before high-speed train disaster, report finds A fracture in a straight section of track "occurred prior to the passage" of a high-speed train that derailed, causing last Sunday's rail disaster in which 45 people died, an initial report has found. A train run by private company Iryo derailed last Sunday and its rear carriages crossed on to the opposite track into the path of an oncoming train run by state-owned Renfe. The CIAF rail investigation commission said not only did Iryo train's front carriages which stayed on the track have "notches" in their wheels, but three earlier trains that went over the track earlier did too. A gap of almost 40cm (15in) in the track has become the focus of the investigation into the crash. Sunday's deadly collision occurred at around 19:45 local time (18:45 GMT), about an hour after the Iryo train left Málaga for Madrid. The train's last three carriages - carriages six to eight - derailed and collided with the Huelva-bound Renfe train. "Carriage six derailed due to a complete lack of continuity in the track," the preliminary report finds. Most of those killed and injured were in the front carriages of the state-operated train. Earlier this week, Spanish Transport Minister Óscar Puente confirmed reports that grooves were found on the wheels of the Iryo train's carriages, which had passed over the track safely. "These notches in the wheels and the deformation observed in the track are compatible with the fact that the track was cracked," the CIAF preliminary report said. It added that three trains that had gone over the tracks at 17:21 on Sunday, 19:01 and then 19:09 had similar notches "with a compatible geometric pattern". Similar grooves are found on carriages two, three and four of the Iryo train, the report says, but carriage five - the last that did not derail - had a groove on its outer edge, suggesting the rail was already tilting outwards before carriage six derailed. The CIAF called its report a "working hypothesis", adding that it "must be corroborated by later detailed calculations and analysis". The transport minister appeared before reporters again on Friday to say that it was too early to have definitive answers, but that if the cause of the crash was the fracture, then it occurred in the minutes and hours before the derailment and could not have been detected. The Adamuz disaster is is the country's worst rail crash in more than a decade. In 2013, Spain suffered its worst high-speed train derailment in Galicia, north-west Spain, which left 80 people dead and 140 others injured.

### 11. [Stuck between the US and Russia, Canada must prove it can defend its Arctic territory](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9vx0p77pn8o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

Stuck between the US and Russia, Canada must prove it can defend its Arctic territory Canada's Arctic is a massive, treacherous, and largely inhospitable place, stretched out over nearly 4 million square kilometres of territory - but with a small population roughly equal to Blackburn in England or Syracuse, New York. "You can take a map of continental Europe, put it on the Canadian Arctic, and there's room to spare," Pierre Leblanc, the former commander of the Canadian Forces Northern Area told the BBC. "And that environment is extremely dangerous." Standing at the defence of that massive landmass is an aging string of early warning radars, eight staffed military bases and about 100 full-time Coast Guard personnel covering 162,000km of coast, about 60% of Canada's total oceanfront. The Arctic region is the scene of intense geopolitical competition, bordered by Russia and the US on either side of the North Pole - and increasingly attractive to China, which has declared itself a "near Arctic state" and vastly expanded its fleet of naval vessels and icebreakers. Standing in the middle is Canada, whose population is a small fraction of the larger Arctic players. Nearly four years after Arctic security was thrust into the headlines following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the defence of Canada's far north has again been brought to the forefront of public consciousness by Donald Trump's designs on Greenland, a self-governing part of the Kingdom of Denmark that the White House says is vital to safeguarding the US from would-be enemies abroad. Canada's Arctic has not gone unnoticed by the Trump administration, which has reportedly become increasingly concerned by perceived vulnerabilities to US adversaries, and in April signed an executive order underscoring American "commitment to ensuring both freedom of navigation and American domination in the Arctic waterways." The Canadian government, for its part, has sought to reassure the US and Nato allies that it is doing its part to protect the region. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Prime Minister Mark Carney said that Canada is working to secure "our shared objectives of security and prosperity in the Arctic" through "unprecedented" investments in radar systems, submarines, aircraft and "boots on the ground" in the region. Col Leblanc, who spent a total of nine years in the Canadian Arctic, said those investments have marked a "major shift" in Arctic security, noting that increases in Canadian defence expenditure - from 2% to 5% of GDP by 2035 - have meant "real action" in terms of additional over-the-horizon radar and aircraft dedicated to the Arctic. Much of this focus, he added, has been prompted by the Trump administration's renewed focus on the Arctic and Greenland. "[That] certainly helps the Canadian government move in the right direction," Leblanc added. Still, challenges persist, including limited port facilities and difficulties resupplying far-flung bases that are sometimes thousands of cold, empty miles apart. While Canada and other US Nato allies have opposed the Trump's administration bid to "take over" Greenland to protect the Arctic, several experts who spoke to the BBC agreed with the administration's broad assessment that the need for additional defences in the region are urgently needed. Troy Bouffard, the director of the Fairbanks, Alaska-based Center for Arctic Security and Resilience, said that while on-the-ground cooperation between the US and Canada in the Arctic "remains the envy of the world", much of the existing defence infrastructure was designed to combat Cold War-era threats, rather than existing ones. In particular, he warned of the prospect of hypersonic missiles that travel at least five times the speed of sound, making them much harder to detect and intercept than traditional ballistic missiles, which would follow predictable arcs over the North Pole. Such a threat is no longer theoretical. Russia has used hypersonic missiles in combat in Ukraine, including a January strike that saw the first operational use of the nuclear-capable "Oreshnik" missile that carries multiple warheads at approximately 10 times the speed of sound. "That technology has changed everything for us. We have to relook at the entire North American defence system and re-do it," he said. "What exists right now cannot defend against hypersonic cruise missiles, at all. Like 0%." Traditional ground-based radar systems, he added, "are not going to work" against these emerging technologies. Space-based satellites must also contend with coverage gaps in high latitudes, prompting a renewed focus and investments in over-the-horizon radar. Notably, over-the-horizon technology - along with space-based sensors - form a key part of the Trump administration's planned Golden Dome missile defence system for North America. For now, it is unclear what role Canada will play in the Golden Dome, a project Trump said at Davos Canada should "be thankful for". On Friday, Trump posted on Truth Social that Canada was opposed to having the Golden Dome over Greenland "even though The Golden Dome would protect Canada. Instead, they voted in favor of doing business with China, who will 'eat them up' within the first year!". The BBC has contacted Carney's office for comment. Those negotiations have been strained by the often antagonistic relationship between the US and Canada, with Trump in May posting that Canada could pay $61bn to join the programme or become the 51st US state and join for free. Trump's remarks prompted Canada's ambassador to the UN, Bob Rae, to compare it to a "protection racket". Despite tensions, Michael Byers, an expert in Arctic security at the University of British Columbia, said that American concerns over Arctic security, and their threats of tariffs, have helped prompt Canada's government to re-focus on the Arctic. "Whether or not American concerns are justified, there is a feeling in Ottawa that we have to satisfy [them]," he said. "No one takes the 51st state issue seriously, but what we do take seriously are the economic pressures that the US is able to impose." "The Canadian government is very aware of that possibility," he added. High level tensions between Ottawa and Washington, however, have yet to turn into tensions on-the-ground in the Arctic - with those there expressing confidence that the US and Canada are cooperating for the time being. "That's the business of politicians," Bouffard said. "It has complicated things, but the practitioners are still going to work together until they're not allowed to. Everyone's going to have to rise above the rhetoric."
