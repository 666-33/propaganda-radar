Israel says it has retrieved remains of final Gaza hostage The Israeli military says it has retrieved the body of the last hostage in Gaza, paving the way for the next phase of US President Donald Trump's peace plan to get under way. It had been searching for Master Sgt Ran Gvili since the ceasefire with Hamas began in October. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Gvili's return "an extraordinary achievement". The Israeli military began searching a cemetery for Gvili on Sunday morning. Hamas's armed wing said it had provided mediators with "all the details and information" about Gvili's location. Netanyahu's office said Israel would reopen Gaza's key border crossing with Egypt once the operation to find and return Gvili was complete. The prime minister hailed the return of Gvili's body, saying: "We promised - and I promised - to bring everyone back. We brought them all back, down to the very last captive," he said. The Israeli military said the clarification of existing intelligence over the weekend had enabled the search of the cemetery near Gaza City. A military official said the cemetery "was located in the area of the Yellow Line", the boundary to territory still controlled by Israeli forces under the ceasefire deal. Hamas said it had "kept updating the mediators with the necessary information, which resulted in retrieving the body". Spokesman Hazem Qassem said the discovery "confirms Hamas's commitment to all the requirements of the ceasefire agreement". In Israel, Itzik Gvili, the hostage's father, paid an emotional goodbye to his son in front of his coffin. "You had the option to stay home, but you said to me: 'Father, I'm not going to leave my friends to fight alone.' "You came out, and you need to see the honour you have here, all the people who brought you. All the police are here with you, the entire army is here with you, the entire nation is here with you. I'm proud of you, my son," Itzik Gvili said. Rani Gvili's sister Shira earlier told the Hostages and Missing Families Forum: "I feel an insane sense of relief. I feel relieved. I am sad. I'm very sad that it ended this way, but it had to end at some point. I am so happy he's coming back home." The retrieval of Gvili may bring closure to his family and it finally ends Israel's hostage agony after 843 days. It also opens the way for further progress in Gaza's ceasefire deal. Israel had resisted moving forward until Gvili was found. Phase two is meant to involve the reconstruction and full demilitarisation of Gaza, including the disarmament of Hamas and other Palestinian groups. The plan is also meant to see the deployment of an as-yet unconstituted International Stabilization Force (ISF) and the progressive withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. On Friday, the Gvili family gathered in Tel Aviv's Hostages Square, as they had every week since he and the other 250 were abducted on 7 October 2023. "I looked them in the eyes and said: 'We will bring Rani home'," Netanyahu recounted on Monday. "I promised you, citizens of Israel: We will bring everyone home." It is a promise finally delivered, and will be celebrated, but his critics say it has taken too long and cost too many lives - Israeli and Palestinian. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announced Gvili's retrieval in a statement, saying: "According to the information and intelligence available to us, Sgt Maj (res) Ran Gvili... a Yamam commando fighter, aged 24 at the time of his death, fell in battle on the morning of October 7, 2023, and his body was abducted to the Gaza Strip. "The IDF shares in the family's grief. The IDF will continue to accompany the families and the returned hostages and to act to strengthen the security of Israel's citizens. "With this, all of the hostages from the Gaza Strip area have been returned." Netanyahu said he sent soldiers into Gaza to return the hostages and defeat Hamas. Opening the Rafah border crossing is an important next step but other difficult issues have to be confronted. How will Hamas be disarmed and unpicked from the fabric of Gaza? When will Israel's army withdraw? And who will make up the international force delivering security for the future? This is the first time since 2014 there are no Israeli hostages, alive or dead, being held in Gaza - a reminder of the deep roots of this conflict and how difficult it could still be to shape a lasting peace. Reacting to the return of Gvili's body, Trump posted on Truth Social: "Just recovered the last Hostage body in GAZA. Thus, got back ALL 20 of the living Hostages, and ALL of the Dead! AMAZING JOB!" The president said "most thought of it as an impossible thing to do" and congratulated his "great team of Champions". Hamas was meant to return all hostages, alive and dead, within 72 hours of the ceasefire taking effect. The process took far longer, but eventually 20 living Israeli hostages and the bodies of 27 dead Israeli and foreign hostages were handed over, leaving only Gvili missing. The policeman was one of 251 hostages taken in the Hamas-led attack on Israel on 7 October 2023 in which about 1,200 people were killed. Most of the hostages were released alive over the course of the next two years in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza. Israel's military campaign in Gaza, launched in response to the attack, has killed 71,660 Palestinians, the Hamas-run health ministry has said.

New Iran videos show bodies piled in hospital and snipers on roofs Verified videos emerging from Iran show bodies piled up in a hospital, snipers stationed on buildings and CCTV cameras being destroyed, following the unprecedented crackdown on protests earlier this month. BBC Verify has been tracking the spread of protests across Iran since they first erupted in late December, but the near total internet blackout imposed by the authorities has made it extremely difficult to document the scale of the state's deadly crackdown on protesters. The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) says it has confirmed the killing of nearly 6,000 people, including 5,633 protesters, since the unrest began at the end of December. It says it is also currently investigating another 17,000 reported deaths received despite an internet shutdown after nearly three weeks. Another group, the Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR), has warned that the final toll could exceed 25,000. Iranian authorities said last week that more than 3,100 people were killed, but that the majority were security personnel or bystanders attacked by "rioters". The latest videos to emerge from the country are understood to have been filmed on 8 and 9 January, when thousands of people took to the streets following a call for nationwide protests from Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the late Shah. They are thought to be the deadliest nights for protesters so far and these newly verified videos show how Iran's security forces have been violently cracking down on protesters. Multiple clips analysed by BBC Verify and BBC Persian show bodies piled up inside a mortuary at Tehranpars hospital in east Tehran. We verified the location of the hospital by matching its interior to other publicly available images and videos of the building, and counted at least 31 bodies in just one video. Another clip shows seven body bags laid on the ground outside the hospital's entrance. Hundreds of people are seen protesting on a highway in west Tehran in another video before multiple rounds of gunfire can be heard and people begin to scream. Protesters have also been seen trying to evade Iran's heavy surveillance infrastructure by disabling CCTV cameras. Footage we verified shows one person in the capital climbing up a post and hitting a surveillance camera several times in an attempt to disable it. A huge crowd of protesters can be seen on the ground and heard cheering as the camera is damaged. We have tracked the spread of the anti-government protests across 71 towns and cities in Iran, though the true number of areas where demonstrations have taken place is likely far higher. In the south-eastern city of Kerman a video taken from high up in a building shows several armed men in military uniform walking down a road firing their weapons continuously, though it is not clear who they are shooting at. A small fire burns in the middle of the road while the sound of protesters chanting can be heard in the background. Snipers have also been recorded on the roofs of buildings. In the north-eastern city of Mashhad verified video shows two men dressed in black on a rooftop of a building in daylight. One man is standing next to a large rifle that is lent against a wall and speaking on the phone. The other man crouches on the floor while smoking. For most people there has been an almost-total internet blackout since 8 January, but some have managed to briefly access the internet using methods such as SpaceX's Starlink satellite internet and virtual private networks (VPNs). More videos are likely to emerge in the coming days as the country's economy has struggled during the blackout. Additional reporting BBC Persian.

**Excerpt**

Nigerian officers to face trial over coup-plot allegations A group of officers in Nigeria are set to face a military court after being accused of "plotting to overthrow the government" of President Bola Tinubu last year, an armed forces' statement has said. Sixteen officers were arrested last October after what were described as "acts of indiscipline and breaches of service regulations". At the time the military dismissed rumours of an attempted coup, but following an investigation, the authorities have acknowledged that some of the 16 will go before a military judicial panel. Nigeria has a complex history of military involvement in politics, with multiple coups between 1966 and 1993, which has made allegations of coup‑plotting highly sensitive. It is not clear how many of the 16 will go on trial, but the military authorities said the process would ensure accountability and uphold "the principles of fairness and due process". A statement added that trying to unseat the elected government was "inconsistent with the ethics, values and professional standards" of the military. In recent years, concerns over instability, insecurity and public frustration have occasionally prompted rumours about dissent within the ranks - rumours the military has repeatedly dismissed. Nigeria has experienced a period of unbroken civilian rule since 1999. The armed forces have consistently stressed their loyalty to civilian authority, often issuing public statements reaffirming their commitment to democracy. This latest development comes at a time when the West African region has experienced a resurgence of coups. Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger and Guinea have all seen their governments toppled by soldiers since the beginning of the decade. However, Guinea recently returned to a democratic rule with the junta leader, Mamadi Doumbouya elected president. These events have created heightened vigilance among governments in the region, including Nigeria, which has traditionally positioned itself as a stabilising force within the regional grouping Ecowas. Within Nigeria, the military continues to face intense operational pressures - from fighting militant jihadist groups in the north-east to tackling criminals and communal violence across the north‑west and central states. Analysts say such pressures, combined with resource constraints and public scrutiny, have put the spotlight on discipline within the armed forces.

**Excerpt**

Spain slashes speed limit on popular train route after fault found Spanish rail authorities have temporarily reduced the speed limit on part of the high-speed line between Madrid and Barcelona after a fault was detected on the track. Transport Minister Óscar Puente said a crack had been found on Sunday night in the line 110km (68 miles) west of Barcelona, between Alcover and l'Espluga de Francolí, in the Catalonia region. It comes days after a high-speed collision killed 45 people in southern Spain and amid severe disruption to local rail services in the north-east of the country. The transport ministry said the fault in the line did not pose a danger to trains travelling along it and that they would continue to move along it. This is the latest and most drastic of several speed reductions on high-speed lines in recent days, following the accident in Adamuz, in Andalusia, earlier this month. The speed limit on the section of track affected will be 80km/h (50mph) until further notice. High-speed trains travel as fast as 300km/h between Madrid and Barcelona - one of Spain's most heavily used long-distance links. Last week, the limit on several sections of the Madrid-Barcelona line was temporarily reduced to 230 km/h after drivers had reported vibrations or other anomalies on the route, before being restored to 300km/h following technical checks. Some sections of the Madrid-Valencia line also had their speed limit cut temporarily to 160km/h and 200km/h. Meanwhile, the local Rodalies rail service in Catalonia has been severely disrupted. Last week, a trainee driver was killed when a train struck a collapsed wall, the Rodalies service was grounded as drivers demanded improved safety guarantees and lines were reviewed. On Monday, two separate incidents caused further chaos in the region, as the service was again suspended, before partially resuming later in the day. The Spanish government said it did not know the cause of the incidents - but did not rule out a cyberattack. The Catalan Republican Left (ERC) party said the Rodalies network had suffered "decades of lack of investment". "The reputational damage is as bad as or worse than the economic losses," said Ramon Talamàs, president of the Chamber of Commerce of Terrassa. Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez is due to appear before Congress on 11 February to be questioned about the rail crisis. These measures come as the investigation continues into the Adamuz high-speed crash, in which the rear carriages of a train heading north towards Madrid were derailed on a straight section of track, causing a collision with an oncoming train. Investigators have been examining a 40cm (16in) section of track that broke loose, apparently shortly before the derailment. The transport ministry has said that the line on which it happened had been renovated and undergone recent technical reviews. However, it has emerged that the piece of damaged rail, which was made in 2023, had been welded onto an older section, reportedly manufactured in 1989, and the join between the two appears to be where it cracked. The head of the independent commission investigating the crash, Iñaki Barrón, said that "everything appears to suggest that" the separation of the two welded pieces of track was the cause of the tragedy. Opposition politicians are demanding the resignation of Óscar Puente, accusing him of misleading the public in the wake of the tragedy.

**Excerpt**

Gunmen storm Mexico football pitch and kill at least 11 people At least 11 people were killed and another dozen injured when gunmen opened fire on locals who had gathered at a football pitch in the city of Salamanca in central Mexico on Sunday. Witnesses said armed men arrived at the grounds in several vehicles and shot at those gathered there seemingly indiscriminately. Many families had stayed behind to socialise after a match between local clubs. At least one woman and one child were among those killed. The motive behind the shooting is not yet clear. Guanajuato, the state in which Salamanca is located, registered the highest number of murders in the whole of Mexico last year. Neighbours reported hearing at least 100 shots ring out as the gunmen opened fire at the Cabañas pitch in the Loma de Flores neighbourhood. Local and federal security forces are now investigating the deadly shooting. It came just a day after several violent incidents in the city, in which a total of five men were killed and another was abducted. Guanajuato has seen a spike in violence committed by a number of gangs that engage in the theft of oil and fuel, as well as other criminal activities such as drug trafficking and extortion. Gang members frequently hold up tanker trucks carrying oil and tap oil pipelines belonging to state-run oil company Pemex. Salamanca, which is home to a major Pemex refinery, has been particularly subjected to violent gang-related attacks. Analysts say that the rivalry between the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) and the Cartel de Santa Rosa de Lima (CSRL) is behind many of the most brutal incidents. Their criminal activities are not confined to Mexico, with both the smuggling of stolen fuel and illicit drugs spreading violence into the United States. Last year, the US State Department designated the CJNG as a Foreign Terrorist Organisation and, more recently, placed sanctions on the CSRL. US President Donald Trump has made the fight against criminal gangs sending illicit drugs such as heroin, fentanyl, methamphetamines and cocaine one of his priorities. He has in the past alleged that "cartels are running Mexico" and has threatened to hit "narco-terrorists" with land strikes. The US has already carried out at least 36 strikes against vessels allegedly transporting drugs by sea, both in the Caribbean and the Pacific, killing at least 125 people. Legal experts and Trump's critics have questioned the legality of these strikes. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum last week handed over 37 "high-impact" suspects to the US in what local media described as an attempt by her government to co-operate with US counternarcotic efforts and thereby ward off the possibility of Trump ordering unilateral strikes against the cartels in Mexican territory.

**Excerpt**

EU investigates Elon Musk's X over Grok AI sexual deepfakes The European Commission has launched an investigation into Elon Musk's X over concerns its AI tool Grok was used to create sexualised images of real people. It follows a similar announcement in January from the UK watchdog Ofcom. If the site is found to have breached the rules of EU's under the Digital Services Act, the Commission could fine the company up to 6% of its global annual turnover. A previous statement from X's Safety account said the social media platform had stopped Grok from digitally altering pictures of people to remove their clothing in "jurisdictions where such content is illegal". Regina Doherty, a member of the European parliament representing Ireland, said the Commission would assess whether "manipulated sexually explicit images" have been shown to users in the EU. Campaigners and victims said the ability to generate sexually explicit pictures using the tool should have "never happened", and Ofcom said its investigation would remain ongoing. The EU regulator said it may "impose interim measures" if X refuses to implement meaningful adjustments. It said it had also extended its ongoing investigation launched in December 2023 over risks associated with X's recommender systems - the algorithm that recommends specific posts to users. Before the Commission's announcement, Elon Musk posted a picture on X on Monday appearing to make light of the new restrictions in place around Grok. The X owner has previously criticised those scrutinising the app's image-editing function - particularly the UK government - calling it "any excuse for censorship". On Sunday, the Grok account on X claimed more than 5.5 billion images were generated by the tool in just 30 days. 'Unacceptable form of degradation' Other investigations into the platform's chatbot are underway in Australia, France and Germany. Grok was temporarily banned in Indonesia and Malaysia, although the latter has now lifted the ban. Henna Virkkunen, Executive Vice-President for Tech Sovereignty, Security and Democracy at the Commission called the sexual deepfakes a "violent, unacceptable form of degradation". "With this investigation, we will determine whether X has met its legal obligations under the DSA, or whether it treated rights of European citizens - including those of women and children - as collateral damage of its service," she said. In a statement to Reuters, Doherty said there were "serious questions" over if platforms such as X were meeting legal obligations "to assess risks properly and to prevent illegal and harmful content from spreading". "The European Union has clear rules to protect people online," she said. "Those rules must mean something in practice, especially when powerful technologies are deployed at scale. "No company operating in the EU is above the law." Andrea Simon, the Director of End Violence Against Women Coalition, told the BBC that "given the evolving nature of AI-generated harm", the accountability "should not stop" with X removing content. "We expect the UK government to do more to ensure tech platforms can't profit from online abuse, like building on the Online Safety Act so it's fit for purpose," she added. The move comes a month after the EU fined X €120m (£105m) over its blue tick badges, saying they "deceive users" because the firm is not "meaningfully verifying" who is behind the account. In response, the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) accused the EU regulator of attacking and censoring US firms. "The European Commission's fine isn't just an attack on X, it's an attack on all American tech platforms and the American people by foreign governments," he said. His remarks were reposted by Musk, who added "absolutely".

**Excerpt**

Trump abandons attack mode as Minneapolis shooting backlash grows The Trump administration has quickly abandoned its familiar "deny and attack" playbook after initially using it when federal agents shot dead Alex Pretti in Minneapolis on Saturday morning. Within 24 hours, as various videos of the shooting circulated online, it became clear that the White House was out of step with public opinion and what Americans could see with their own eyes. Since then, the administration – and the president himself - have changed tack, blaming Democrats for what happened and focusing less on the actions of the American nurse who was killed. Democrats, meanwhile, have increased their criticism of the president's mass deportation policy and the aggresive tactics of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), leaning into a political fight that could result in a new government shutdown on Friday. On Monday morning, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche described the situation as a "powder keg". While he blamed the Democrats, many on both sides of America's political divide will agree that the current situation is fraught with peril. The initial administration response to Pretti's death was straightforward. The 37-year-old was portrayed as a domestic terrorist bent on bloodshed. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said that Pretti wished to "inflict harm" and was "brandishing" a weapon. US Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino said that it "looks like a situation where an individual wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement". Senior presidential adviser Stephen Miller called Pretti a "would-be assassin". This White House has typically been quick to push back when criticised. "Deny and attack" has long been a bedrock Trump strategy for handling adversity. But, perhaps tellingly, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt refused to echo Miller's comments herself on Monday when pressed on whether the president agreed with his senior adviser. Instead, she said a full investigation would be carried out. It was a notably more muted tone than that struck immediately after the shooting. That initial response had echoed the path the administration took three weeks ago, when federal law enforcement shot and killed another Minneapolis resident, Renee Good. They said Good was a terrorist who had "weaponised" her vehicle in an attempt to injure ICE agents. As with Good's case, the federal government's version of events has been challenged by local officials, eyewitnesses and the victim's family. In a statement on Sunday, Pretti's parents asked for the truth to come out, adding: "The sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting." Multiple videos of Saturday's deadly encounter contradict many of the administration's initial claims. The footage shows Pretti filming ICE agents with his mobile phone and helping a woman who is pushed over before both are pepper-sprayed. Pretti is visibly not holding a gun when he is wrestled to the ground. DHS says Pretti had a 9mm semi-automatic handgun and two magazines of ammunition. Local police have said Pretti was a legal gun owner. Under Minnesota law, citizens can legally carry a concealed handgun in public, if they have a permit. This time around, the administration's initial response quickly had become difficult for the administration to maintain. "People have had enough," Minneapolis Police Brian O'Hara said, noting that his officers made hundreds of arrests of violent offenders last year without resorting to shooting. "This is not sustainable." Republicans in Washington DC and elsewhere have expressed growing unease with how the administration was handling the situation. Vermont Governor Phil Scott called the federal efforts in Minnesota "a complete failure of coordination of acceptable public safety and law enforcement practices, training and leadership" – at best. At worst, he said, it was "deliberate federal intimidation and incitement of American citizens". Utah Senator John Curtis criticised Noem's "premature" response to the shooting, which he said "came before all the facts were known and weakened confidence" in the law enforcement mission. Homeland security chairmen in both the House and Senate say they plan to hold public hearings Since Sunday night, there has been a marked change in tone from the White House. Veteran's Affairs Secretary Doug Collins offered condolences to the Pretti family. The president posted a message on his Truth Social website calling the death "tragic" and blaming it on "Democrat ensued chaos" – a message echoed by Vice-President JD Vance. On Monday morning, Trump posted that he was dispatching "border czar" Tom Homan to Minnesota to direct law-enforcement efforts there. Homan, who handled deportations during Democrat Barack Obama's administration, is considered a more measured, politically attuned operator less prone to the kind of bombastic declarations recently made by Noem and Bovino. "Tom is tough but fair, and will report directly to me," Trump wrote. While Homan's assignment to Minneapolis may not necessarily reflect a change in policy – this administration has yet to show signs of backing away from its aggressive immigration enforcement – it could be a change in presentation, as the president tries to come to grips with a public mood that opinion surveys suggest is souring on how his immigration crackdown is being carried out. In a CBS survey taken before the weekend's shooting, 61% of respondents said that ICE is being "too tough when stopping and detaining people", while 58% disapproved of his handling of immigration as a whole. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, when asked by BBC News about Homan's involvement, said that he may provide a new avenue to work with the administration. "I don't want to foreclose the possibility that reasonable minds can prevail," he added, "but we are here exactly because the federal government had unreasonable positions." Another potential thaw came when Trump announced on Monday that he had spoken with Minnesota's Democratic governor, Tim Walz. "It was a very good call," Trump wrote. "We, actually, seemed to be on a similar wavelength." That represents a marked cooling of what had been a series of heated exchanges between the two men in recent weeks – and could portend the kind of de-escalation in Minnesota that many politicians have been calling for. That may not be enough for Washington Democrats, however, who have come under increasing pressure to draw a bright line against the Trump administration's rhetoric and policy. Senate Democrats have announced they will now block that funding measure in their chamber, which would trigger a partial government shutdown on Friday night. "I am voting against any funding for DHS until and unless more controls are put in place to hold ICE accountable," said Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii. "These repeated incidents of violence across the country are unlawful, needlessly escalatory and making all of us less safe." Such a move is not without its own political risks, however. Democrats triggered a record-setting shutdown last autumn over health care subsidies but ultimately relented with little to show for it. And they will also be wary of pushing too far on immigration and law and order, two issues where they poll poorly. At the moment, both Republicans and Democrats are grappling with how to handle what has become an explosive situation. At stake is the public perception of Trump's immigration policy, a core political issue for the president and one that helped him win back the White House.
