Trump says administration 'reviewing everything' after shooting of Alex Pretti US President Donald Trump says his administration is "reviewing everything" after the fatal shooting by immigration agents of 37-year-old intensive care nurse Alex Pretti in Minneapolis on Saturday. In his comments to the Wall Street Journal, Trump also indicated that he would eventually withdraw agents from the city. But he did not give a time frame. Protests continued in Minneapolis and other US cities on Sunday, as Minnesota Governor Tim Walz warned that America was at an "inflection point". The facts around the incident - the second fatal shooting by agents of a US citizen in recent weeks - have been hotly contested, setting up a fresh confrontation between state and federal officials. The administration has defended the officer who shot Pretti. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Pretti was shot because he was "brandishing" a gun. Local authorities deny this, adding that the gun was legally registered and that Pretti was shot after the firearm was removed. The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump was directly asked twice whether the agent had done the right thing. He responded: "We're looking, we're reviewing everything and will come out with a determination." He also told the newspaper: "I don't like any shooting. I don't like it." He added: "But I don't like it when somebody goes into a protest and he's got a very powerful, fully loaded gun with two magazines loaded up with bullets also. That doesn't play good either." The Trump administration is facing pressure from some prominent Republicans, who have joined opposition Democrats in calling for a wide-ranging investigation. Senator Bill Cassidy said the probe should involve both federal and state officials. Congressman James Comer, an ally of Trump, suggested that the president should consider withdrawing immigration agents from Minneapolis and sending them elsewhere, telling Fox News that the city's mayor and state governor were putting them in harm's way, and "there's a chance of losing more innocent lives". In his comments to the Wall Street Journal, Trump said of the deployment: "At some point we will leave. We've done, they've done a phenomenal job." Multiple vigils were held for Pretti in Minneapolis over the weekend. Lifelong resident Pege Miller, 69, was among those who gathered on Sunday afternoon to pay her respects and protest against the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE). "I'm tired of protesting," she told the BBC. "We can't comprehend how this is happening. Why are we letting this happen?" Demonstrators of all ages were chanting "No more Minnesota nice - Minneapolis on strike" and "ICE out now" before they began moving through the city streets. "This is not the America I fought for," said one man the BBC spoke to, who asked not to be named. Protests have spread to other US cities, including New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco. The chief executives of more than 60 Minnesota-based businesses, including 3M, Best Buy and Target have also signed an open letter calling for "an immediate de-escalation of tensions" and for local and federal officials "to work together to find real solutions". Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara told the BBC that state officers were blocked from accessing the scene of Pretti's shooting by federal agents, despite securing a search warrant. He added that all levels of law enforcement in Minnesota have been working with federal law enforcement "for several years", and that the unfolding situation in Minnesota was hampering agencies' ability to continue such investigations. Lawmakers continue to be divided over the shooting of Pretti, as well as his second Amendment right to bear arms. It is legal in Minnesota to carry a handgun in public if you have a permit. The administration has characterised the Minneapolis operation as a public safety effort aimed at deporting criminals illegally in the US. It has also described Pretti as a "domestic terrorist". Critics warn migrants with no criminal record and US citizens are being detained, too. Pretti's family issued a statement in response to the comment, saying: "The sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting". They added that he had no interaction with law enforcement beyond a handful of traffic tickets. According to Associated Press (AP), court records show he had no criminal record. "Please get the truth out about our son. He was a good man," his family said in the statement. On Sunday, Tim Walz said: "I don't care if you are conservative and you are flying a Donald Trump flag, you're a libertarian, don't tread on me, you're a Democratic Socialist of America. This is an inflection point, America. "If we cannot all agree that the smearing of an American citizen and besmirching everything they stood for and asking us not to believe what we saw, I don't know what else to tell you." Backlash against the Trump administration's crackdown is growing, including from within the Republican party. Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt told CNN that people were watching fellow Americans being shot on television and that "federal tactics and accountability" had become a growing concern for voters. Louisiana Senator Bill Cassidy said the Minneapolis shooting was "incredibly disturbing" and "the credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake." Democrats have responded by threatening to block a key government financing package if it contains funds for the Department of Homeland Security, of which ICE is a part, raising the prospect of another government shutdown. Former Democratic Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama have both criticised the situation in Minneapolis, with the former described events in Minneapolis as "horrible scenes" that "I never thought would take place in America." Few Minnesotans the BBC spoke to said they supported ICE operations, but several polls suggest about half of voters nationwide support President Trump's efforts to deport those living in the US illegally. Other polls indicate voters are split on how Trump is carrying out that crackdown on undocumented immigrants. Meanwhile on Sunday evening Trump demanded in a post on Truth Social that Walz and Frey, as well as "EVERY Democrat Governor and Mayor in the United States" must "formally cooperate with the Trump Administration to enforce our Nation's Laws, rather than resist and stoke the flames of Division, Chaos, and Violence". He also called on US Congress to end sanctuary cities, which he alleged were the cause of "all these problems". The term 'sanctuary city' is commonly used to describe places in the US that limit their assistance to federal immigration authorities. Trump's posts followed remarks from White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, where she condemned Walz as wanting chaos, and encouraging "left-wing agitators to stalk and record federal officers in the middle of lawful operations". Federal agents shot and killed Pretti in Minneapolis on Saturday, and videos have since emerged showing a scuffle between Border Patrol agents and Pretti just before the shooting. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said the agents fired in self-defence after Pretti, who they say had a handgun, resisted their attempts to disarm him. Eyewitnesses, local officials and the victim's family have challenged that account, pointing out he had a phone in his hand, not a weapon. O'Hara, the Minneapolis police chief, told the BBC that Pretti was a lawful gun owner with no criminal record other than traffic violations. The National Rifle Association (NRA) - which is typically aligned with Trump - has joined other US gun lobby groups in calling for a "full investigation" into the killing of Pretti. In a statement, it said: "Responsible public voices should be awaiting a full investigation, not making generalisations and demonising law-abiding citizens." US Border Patrol commander Greg Bovino said earlier that at the time of the shooting, ICE agents were looking for a man named Jose Huerta Chuma during a "targeted" operation, and that Chuma's criminal history includes domestic assault, intentional infliction of bodily harm and disorderly conduct. The Minnesota Department of Corrections (DOC) has since rebutted those claims and said that Huerta had never been in Minnesota DOC custody and public records reflected only misdemeanour-level traffic offences from more than a decade ago. The latest shooting follows weeks of tensions between the Minnesota authorities, federal agents and protesters who have taken to the streets to observe the agents during their anti-immigration raids. Earlier this month, an ICE agent shot dead Renee Good, a 37-year-old Minneapolis resident who was taking part in such an observation. In a statement to CBS News, the BBC's US media partner, Good's family law firm Romanucci & Blandin urged all Americans to "trust their own eyes as they interpret the horrific video" of Pretti's shooting. Trump's crackdown in Minneapolis was launched in December after some Somali immigrants were convicted in a massive fraud of state welfare programmes. The state is home to the largest community of Somali immigrants in the US. ICE agents have the power to stop, detain and arrest people they suspect of being in the US illegally.

'This is horrifying' - Minneapolis residents reel from second deadly shooting At the Calvary Baptist Church in Minneapolis, the doors swung open and shut as locals sought refuge from the biting cold on Sunday. The 140-year-old building sits just blocks away from where Alex Pretti, an intensive care nurse, was shot dead by federal immigration agents during a confrontation on Saturday morning. In the wake of the shooting, which marked the second time in less than a month that a US citizen has been killed by agents in the city, the church has become what locals describe as a haven from the unrest and uncertainty outside. There was no service here on Sunday. Instead volunteers and church staff, such as Ann Hotz, who works at the church's daycare centre, handed out coffee, snacks and hand warmers to those who stopped by. Some were on their way to lay flowers at a nearby memorial for Pretti, while others visited on their way home from protests against the weeks-long federal immigration enforcement operation in the city. "Yesterday, I fell apart," Hotz told the BBC as she helped move cases of water outside. "Today I'm here to stand with my community and help our neighbours as they remember Alex and mourn him." "But I do have to say, the helpers are getting really tired," she added. "This is exhausting, and so we need there to be a change." "This is what America is now," Dean Caldwell-Tautges, the church administrator, said of the actions of federal immigration agents in his hometown in recent weeks. Caldwell-Tautges, who was handing out whistles which have been used to alert people to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity, said supporting the community in this way was "the Christian thing to do". The city of Minneapolis now finds itself at the forefront of the national immigration debate for the second time this month. Renee Nicole Good, another Minnesota resident, was shot and killed by an ICE agent on 7 January. Videos of both shootings quickly spread on social media. They prompted angry protests from those who want to see an end to an immigration enforcement operation that has seen thousands of agents deployed to the city's streets. President Trump ordered the agents to the Democrat-held state in December, pledging a massive deportation of undocumented migrants. A crackdown on illegal immigration was central to his successful re-election campaign and is backed by many around the country. The administration has characterised the Minneapolis operation as a public safety efffort aimed at deporting criminals illegally in the US. Critics warn migrants with no criminal record and US citizens are being detained, too. On Sunday, in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Trump praised the agents' work but suggested the operation would eventually end, although he did not specify when. "At some point we will leave," Trump said. "They've done a phenomenal job." The state's Governor Tim Walz has urged the president to remove the agents immediately. "We believe that Trump needs to pull his 3,000 untrained agents out of Minnesota before they kill another American in the street," he said on Sunday. Other state and local officials have echoed Walz's view. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said the agents fired in self-defence after Pretti, who they say had a handgun, resisted their attempts to disarm him on Saturday. Eyewitnesses, local officials and the victim's family have challenged that account, pointing out Pretti had a phone in his hand, not a weapon. His parents, meanwhile, have accused the administration of spreading "sickening lies" about what happened. Over the course of the weekend, multiple vigils were held in the city as residents sought to remember and celebrate Pretti's life. At the site where he was killed in south Minneapolis, close to the Calvary Baptist Church, mourners gathered at all hours to lay flowers and light candles in his honour. One sign, drawn with red paint and directed at federal agents, read "stop killing us". Lifelong Minneapolis resident Pege Miller, 69, was among those gathered on Sunday afternoon to protest against ICE and pay her respects to Pretti. "I'm tired of protesting," she said. "We can't comprehend how this is happening. Why are we letting this happen?" "We're on tenterhooks," she added. "We don't know what's going to happen next." Hundreds of people gathered for an impromptu protest downtown later on Sunday. Many there expressed anger and sadness about the immigration operation. Protesters repeatedly chanted: "No more Minnesota nice, Minneapolis will strike." Among those chanting was Felix Johnson, who said he protested for the first time in his life a few weeks ago when he saw a video which appeared to show a four-year-old girl who was left in a car after her father was detained by ICE. He held a sign that read "ICE out", while dozens of other posters in the crowd included profanities directed at immigration officials. "I don't understand how they can come in and just start snatching people that are citizens and start treating them like they're animals," Johnson said. Few Minnesotans the BBC spoke to said they supported ICE operations, but several polls suggest about half of voters nationwide support President Trump's efforts to deport those living in the US illegally. Other polls indicate voters are split on how Trump is carrying out that crackdown on undocumented immigrants. One conducted by Politico shortly after Renee Good's death this month suggested about half of Americans felt the mass deportation campaign was too aggressive. At the protest in downtown Minneapolis on Sunday, one man held a sign that read "Veterans Against ICE". "I joined [the military] to serve a country that, while never perfect, was a country that was improving, that was growing," he said. "I joined to support the tenets of freedom of this country and what we're seeing here, this is the opposite, this is not promoting freedom. This is horrifying."

**Excerpt**

NRA and other US gun activists push back at Trump officials over Minneapolis shooting The National Rifle Association (NRA) has joined other US gun lobby groups in calling for a "full investigation" by the Trump administration into the killing of Alex Pretti in Minnesota. Comments from the NRA come after a border agent fatally shot Pretti - registered nurse at a Veterans Affairs hospital - in Minneapolis on Saturday. State and federal officials have given starkly different accounts. The Trump administration has said Pretti carried a gun and posed a danger to officers - while no available video shows Pretti holding a gun. The NRA labelled a suggestion by a federal prosecutor that people who carry guns risk being lawfully shot by officers as "dangerous and wrong". "Responsible public voices should be awaiting a full investigation, not making generalisations and demonising law-abiding citizens," the NRA said in a statement. The NRA - which is typically aligned with Donald Trump - was reacting to comments from First Assistant US Attorney for the Central District of California on Saturday night. Bill Essayli wrote on social media: "If you approach law enforcement with a gun, there is a high likelihood they will be legally justified in shooting you. Don't do it!" In a separate social-media post, the NRA said: "As there is with any officer-involved shooting, there will be a robust and comprehensive investigation that takes place to determine if the use of force was justified. "As we await these facts and gain a clearer understanding, we urge the political voices to lower the temperature to ensure their constituents and law enforcement officers stay safe." Essayli's comments have drawn criticism from other gun advocacy groups, as well as politicians from across the spectrum. Gun Owners of America said in a statement: "The Second Amendment protects Americans' right to bear arms while protesting - a right the federal government must not infringe upon." Republican Thomas Massie said: "Carrying a firearm is not a death sentence, it's a constitutionally protected God-given right, and if you don't understand this you have no business in law enforcement or government." In a follow-up social media post, Essayli accused critics of taking his comments out of context. "I never said it's legally justified to shoot law-abiding concealed carriers," he said on X. "My comment addressed agitators approaching law enforcement with a gun and refusing to disarm." For the second time this month, federal agents have been involved in a fatal shooting in Minneapolis linked to a crackdown on illegal immigration by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency. Bystander video footage has captured the moments before Pretti was shot on Saturday. The altercation that led to Pretti's shooting was recorded from many points of view and federal and state officials have given conflicting accounts. The Department for Homeland Security shared an image of a gun it claimed belonged to Pretti and said he was a threat to officers. On Saturday, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was asked to clarify if Pretti had brandished a gun and said agents fired what she called "defensive shots" while trying to disarm Pretti. "They responded according to their training, and took action to defend the officer's life and those of the public around him. And, I don't know of any peaceful protester that shows up with a gun and ammunition rather than a sign." Minnesota Governor Tim Walz branded the Trump administration's version of events "nonsense" and "lies." Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey likened the federal operation to an invasion and accused ICE of "trying to spin this as an action of self-defence".

At least seven dead and 800,000 without power as major winter storm hits US A dangerous winter storm has swept across the US, leaving at least seven people dead and cutting power to hundreds of thousands of homes. Schools and roads across the country have been closed and flights have been cancelled as "life threatening" conditions stretched from Texas to New England, according to the National Weather Service (NWS). At least two people died of hypothermia in Louisiana, and other deaths linked to the storm have been reported in Texas, Tennessee and Kansas. As of Sunday afternoon, more than 800,000 households had lost power, according to poweroutage.us. Meanwhile, more than 11,000 flights were cancelled, FlightAware reported. Widespread heavy snow, sleet and freezing rain, which is a dangerous phenomenon where cooled rain droplets freeze instantly on surfaces, could last for days, and the storm could affect around 180 million Americans - more than half the population. "The snow and the ice will be very, very slow to melt and won't be going away anytime soon, and that's going to hinder any recovery efforts," Allison Santorelli, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, told the BBC's US media partner CBS News. Louisiana's Department of Health confirmed on Sunday that two men had died of hypothermia. The mayor of Austin, Texas, said there had been an "exposure-related" death. Officials in Kansas said a woman, whose body was found on Sunday afternoon covered in snow, "may have succumbed to hypothermia". Weather-related deaths of three people have also been reported in Tennessee. New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani wrote in a post on X that at least five people in the city had died on Saturday but added their cause of death was yet to be determined. He said, however, "It is a reminder that every year New Yorkers succumb to the cold". New York state Governor Kathy Hochul warned residents to stay inside and off roads. "This is certainly the coldest weather we've seen, the coldest winter storm we've seen in years," she said on Sunday. "A sort of an arctic siege has taken over our state and many other states across the nation." Hochul said the "brutal" conditions were expected to bring the longest cold stretch and highest snow falls in years. "It is bone chilling and it is dangerous," she said. Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear said on Sunday that the state was seeing more ice and less snow than was originally predicted. "That is not good news for Kentucky," he said. Weather experts have warned that one of the biggest dangers of the storm is ice, which has the potential to damage trees, down power lines and make roads unsafe. In Virginia and Kentucky, authorities have responded to hundreds of crashes on roads. Canadians have also been hit with heavy snow and hundreds of cancelled flights. Officials estimate that there will be 15-30cm (5-11in) of snowfall in the province of Ontario. Emergencies declared Nearly half the states have declared emergencies, and schools across the country are already canceling classes in anticipation of the storm continuing into Monday. The US Senate has also scrapped a scheduled vote for Monday evening. In declaring an emergency in the nation's capital, Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said: "We're experiencing the biggest snowstorm in a decade in DC this weekend." While places in the north such as the Dakotas and Minnesota are used to below- freezing temperatures in winter, it is unusual to see such extreme cold in states like Texas, Louisiana and Tennessee, where temperatures are around 15-20C below the seasonal average. Those states could also see ice accretions of around an inch caused by freezing rain. The polar vortex - a ring of strong westerly winds that form above the Arctic every winter containing a pool of very cold air - led to the powerful storm, according to weather experts. When the winds are strong, they stay in place, however when the winds weaken, the vortex loops further south and cold air plunges toward the US. As the cold air meets mild air in the south, the air rises and storm fronts form. In this case, the winter storm is pushing northwards and eastwards, clearing the Canadian maritime by Tuesday but leaving more cold air in its wake. It is forecast to stay dangerously cold into the start of February. Some experts contend climate change could influence the behaviour of the polar vortex due to changes in sea surfaces temperatures in our warming world. If you're affected by the severe weather in the US, please get in touch.

**Excerpt**

Tearful goodbyes as Japan returns pandas to China amid worsening ties Thousands of people flocked to a zoo in Japan on Sunday to say farewell to the country's last two giant pandas, who are set to return to China on Tuesday. Emotions ran high at the Ueno zoo in Tokyo as people stood in line – some for as long as three-and-a-half hours – to see twin cubs Xiao Xiao and Lei Lei one last time. This comes at a very tense moment in relations between Tokyo and Beijing. Ties have sharply deteriorated after Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said Tokyo would get involved militarily if China attacked Taiwan. The twins' departure will leave Japan without any pandas for the first time since 1972, the year the two countries normalised diplomatic ties. The People's Republic of China has used giant pandas as a gesture of goodwill towards its international allies and competitors since it was founded in 1949. But China retains ownership of all pandas it loans to foreign countries, including cubs born abroad. In return, host countries pay an annual fee of about $1m (£790,000) per pair of pandas. According to Tokyo's metropolitan government, some 108,000 people vied to get one of the 4,400 slots available for one last look at the zoo's beloved pandas. "I have been bringing my son here since he was a baby, so I hope it becomes a good memory for him. I'm glad we could come today to remember them," Ai Shirakawa told the BBC. Another woman recalled witnessing the pandas' growth journey. "Witnessing their growth, especially since they were so small, has been such a joy," she said. Some visitors were pictured sobbing as they bade the bears goodbye. Xiao Xiao and Lei Lei were born in 2021 at the Ueno zoo to their mother Shin Shin and their father Ri Ri, both of whom were on loan to Japan for breeding research. More recently, China's panda loans have coincided with major trade agreements. In 2011, the loan of two pandas to Edinburgh Zoo in Scotland was agreed during negotiations over contracts to supply salmon meat, Land Rover vehicles and energy technology to China. Many pandas have been returned to China in recent years – a loan agreement typically lasts 10 years although extensions are common. However, the prospects of a new panda loan to Japan have remained uncertain amid the escalating row. Japanese prime minister Sanae Takaichi's comments on Taiwan angered Beijing which views the self-governed island as part of its territory and has not ruled out the use of force to "reunite" with it. Both sides have since engaged in increasingly hostile actions and rhetoric towards each other. Early this month, China tightened restrictions on exports of rare earth-related products to Japan.

Eighteen dead after Philippines ferry with 300 passengers sinks At least 18 people have died after a ferry carrying more than 350 passengers and crew members onboard sank in the waters off Philippines' southern coast. Search crews have rescued 317 people on board the MV Trisha Kerstin 3, but at least 24 people are still missing, according to the Philippine Coast Guard. The ship, both a cargo and passenger ferry, was on its way from the southern island of Mindanao to Jolo island when it issued a distress call at 1:50 local time Monday (17:50 GMT Sunday). Authorities say they are investigating the cause of the sinking. The Philippines - an archipelago nation of 7,100 islands - has a long history of maritime disasters involving inter-island ferries. "Based on the account of some survivors, the waters in the area were rough at the time," Philippine Coast Guard spokeswoman Noemie Cayabyab said in a televised interview, according to an AFP report. A video shared by the disaster management office in the southwestern Bongao Municipality show people wearing life vests floating in the water as they wait for rescuers. Another Facebook video posted by Basilan Governor Mujiv Hataman showed survivors wrapped in blankets as they disembarked from a rescue boat. Rescuers have been overwhelmed by the influx of survivors, Basilan emergency responder Ronalyn Perez told AFP. "The challenge really is the number of patients that are coming in. We are short-staffed at the moment," Perez said. Another rescuer said their office had received more than 100 calls from family members, AFP reported. Poor maintenance and overloading have been blamed for past ferry accidents in the Philippines. Despite this, many Filipinos still travel by ferry due to its low costs. In May 2023, 28 people died after a passenger ferry caught fire. The fatalities included three children, among them a six-month-old baby. The year before that, at least seven people died after a fire in a high-speed ferry carrying 134 people. Additional reporting by Joel Guinto

**Excerpt**

Gold tops $5,000 for first time ever, adding to historic rally The price of gold has risen above $5,000 (£3,659) an ounce for the first time ever, extending a historic rally that saw the precious metal jump by more than 60% in 2025. It comes as tensions between the US and NATO over Greenland have added to growing concerns about financial and geopolitical uncertainty. US President Donald Trump's trade policies have also worried markets. On Saturday he threatened to impose a 100% tariff on Canada if it strikes a trade deal with China. Gold and other precious metals are seen as so-called safe-haven assets that investors buy in times of uncertainty. On Friday, silver topped $100 an ounce for the first time, building on its almost 150% rise last year. Demand for precious metals has also been driven by a range of other factors including higher-than-usual inflation, the weak US dollar, buying by central banks around the world and as the US Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates again this year. Wars in Ukraine and Gaza, as well as Washington seizing Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, have also helped push up the price of gold. One of the biggest appeals of gold is its relative scarcity. Only around 216,265 tonnes of the metal have ever been mined, according to the World Gold Council trade association. That's enough to fill between three to four Olympic-sized swimming pools. The majority of that was only extracted from the earth since 1950, as mining technology advanced and new deposits were discovered. The US Geological Survey estimates that another 64,000 tonnes of gold can still be mined from underground reserves, although the supply of the metal is predicted to plateau in the coming years. "When you own gold, it's not attached to the debt of somebody else like a bond is or an equity where the performance of a company will drive performance," said Nicholas Frappell, global head of institutional markets at ABC Refinery. "It's a really good diversifier in a very uncertain world," he added. 'People go to gold' Gold saw a blockbuster year in 2025, with its biggest annual gain since 1979 as investors flocked to precious metals. With financial markets spooked by concerns including Trump's tariffs and fears that artificial intelligence-related stocks are overpriced, gold repeatedly hit new record highs. "I think a large part of that is the extreme uncertainty we have around US policy," said Nikos Kavlis from research consultancy Metals Focus. While economic concerns can help to push up the price of gold, it also tends to rise when investors expect interest rates to be cut. Lower rates typically mean smaller returns for investments such as bonds, so investors look to assets like gold and silver. The US Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut its main interest rate twice this year. "It's inversely correlated because the opportunity cost of keeping the money in a [government bond] is really not worth it anymore, so people go to gold," said Ahmad Assiri, Research Strategist at Pepperstone. It's not just investors who have been buying up gold. Last year, central banks added hundreds of tons of bullion to their reserves, according to the World Gold Council. "There's a very clear shift away from the US dollar, which is benefiting gold immensely," said Kavalis. The start of this year has seen gold continue to rally but Frappell warns the "news-driven" market could also result in a fall in its price. "There's got to be scope for unexpected news that actually might be positive for the world and not necessarily positive for gold," he said. But not everybody is buying gold for purely investment reasons. In many cultures, the metal is purchased during festivals or given as gifts at celebrations such as weddings. In India, the annual Diwali festival is believed to be an auspicious occasion to buy precious metals in order to bring on wealth and luck. According to the US investment bank Morgan Stanley, Indian households held $3.8tn of gold, equivalent to 88.8% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP). Neighbouring China is the world's largest single consumer market for gold, with many believing that buying it brings good fortune. "We often see a seasonal uptick in demand around Chinese New Year, which we are seeing at the moment to an extent," said Kavalis, referencing the upcoming Year of the Horse, which begins in February.

Venezuela frees dozens of political prisoners, human rights group says A leading Venezuelan human rights group says at least 80 political prisoners have been released under pressure from the US. Alfredo Romero, head of Foro Penal, said his group was verifying the identities of those freed from prisons across the country on Saturday - and more releases were likely to take place. It is the latest batch of detainees released since the US seized Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in a raid, and took him to New York to stand trial on drug-trafficking charges earlier this month. On Friday Venezuela's interim President Delcy Rodriguez said more than 600 prisoners had been freed - but Foro Penal says this figure has been inflated. Romero announced the releases on social media. He also posted an image of Foro Penal colleague Kennedy Tejeda who he said had been held in Tocorón prison, west of the capital caracas since August 2024. In a post on X, Foro Penal lawyer Gonzalo Himiob said the number of releases could rise above 80 "as we proceed with verification". Previously, Foro Penal said that many of those freed in recent weeks have not had the charges against them dropped. This has left them in legal limbo and they have been barred from speaking in public, the group said. Before this weekend's developments, the group had confirmed the release of just 156 political prisoners since 8 January. Some domestic opposition figures and at least five Spanish nationals are among those confirmed to have been freed so far. Separately, Rodriguez said she was due to have a call on Monday with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Turk, to ask the UN to verify the lists of those released so far. Human rights groups and activists have long accused the government of using detentions to muzzle critics. The Venezuelan government has denied holding political prisoners, insisting they were arrested for criminal activity. Many were detained after the 2024 presidential election, when Maduro claimed victory despite opponents and many countries disputing the results.

Heatwave warnings across Australia as millions celebrate national day Australian authorities have issued heatwave warnings for most of the country as millions celebrate Australia Day. Temperatures are expected to peak on Tuesday, reaching the "high forties" Celsius in the southern states of Victoria and South Australia, the Bureau of Meteorology said. On Sunday, South Australia recorded temperatures as high as 48.5C, according to the bureau, which is warning of fire danger in parts of the country. Some national day celebrations on Monday have been cancelled out of safety concerns. In Adelaide, an Australia Day parade and light show have been cancelled due to the extreme heat forecast. "While this is deeply disappointing for the community, performers and partners, community safety and wellbeing must come first," organisers said. Australia Day - 26 January - is the anniversary of the 1788 landing of Britain's First Fleet, which began the era of colonisation. But to many Indigenous Australians the occasion is a reminder of their cultural destruction under European settlers - referring to the occasion as "Invasion Day". Across the country on Monday, crowds gathered for rallies in support of Indigenous Australians. Aside from Victoria and South Australia, heatwave warnings have also been issued in New South Wales, Queensland, Tasmania, Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory. Many of these warnings will remain in place until Wednesday. "We haven't seen heatwave conditions like this in Victoria for almost 20 years," Tim Wiebusch, Victoria's emergency management commissioner, told ABC. "It was 2009 ahead of the bushfires where we saw those prevailing conditions and so we are indicating to all Victorians that this is a very serious set of weather conditions." On Monday, the Bureau of Meteorology warned of "extreme fire dangers" across parts of South Australia and much of south-western Victoria "due to very hot and dry weather combined with moderate to gusty winds". Firefighters in Victoria are working to combat several fires across the state, which have prompted evacuations and threatened properties. The heat has also affected the Australian Open at Melbourne Park. Tennis player Jannik Sinner was seen suffering from cramps on the court on Saturday, before play was temporarily suspended in the rising heat. Nearly 80,000 fans were warned to take care under the scorching sun. Meanwhile, parts of Western Australia were pummelled by Tropical Cyclone Luana over the weekend. The storm damaged homes and a popular beach resort before weakening as it moved inland. The meteorological bureau has advised people to find places to keep cool, like their homes, libraries, community centres or shopping centres. It also told people to close their windows and draw the curtains to keep heat out of their homes.

**Excerpt**

Murder and MI5: How an extraordinary battle erupted over what the state keeps secret Paul Thompson was shot dead while being driven home in a taxi through Belfast in April 1994. He was murdered in a sectarian attack by loyalist paramilitaries who had set out to kill Catholics. The taxi driver was a friend who was collecting a fare at another address in the Springfield Park area in the west of the city. But no one at the address had rung the taxi firm. The call is suspected to have been a deliberate decoy by the killers who wanted to lure a taxi as prey. Paul was not specifically targeted. They could not have known he would ask for a lift or be in the area. One resident described hearing a heavy burst of gunfire after 23:00, running to the car and finding Paul. Members of a banned loyalist terror group, the Ulster Defence Association, using the cover name Ulster Freedom Fighters, claimed responsibility for the killing. During the Troubles in Northern Ireland, the group repeatedly murdered Catholic civilians like Paul. On the morning of the day that Paul was killed, locals had told police about a hole in a barrier – known as the 'Peace Line' – which separated the largely Catholic Springfield Park area from a largely Protestant neighbouring area. The residents were concerned the breach could give loyalist paramilitaries access to launch an attack. The hole was not fixed. After the murder, those responsible escaped through it. An inquest into Paul's death was opened in 1995 but never concluded. No-one has ever been held to account. There has never been a full investigation. Left by themselves to fight for answers, his mother Margaret and brother Eugene, both now dead, came to suspect collusion between British security forces and informants – meaning state agents - in the group responsible. In 2024, a coroner decided to release to the family a summary of secret information held by the police. This was said by the coroner to be of central relevance to the case and the police supported the move. But the British government and MI5 argued this would prejudice national security and mounted a legal challenge. The case, which centred on who had the power to decide to release the information, reached the Supreme Court last summer, with Paul Thompson's brother, Eugene, tuning in to hearings from a hospice, as he neared death from cancer. The case is widely viewed as a major test of the state's policy of neither confirming nor denying (NCND) information involving national security. Who decides what is secret? The NCND policy is a position adopted by the government and security services when responding to questions about sensitive matters. It means there will be no confirmation, no denial, and no acknowledgement that the information requested is true, false, or even exists. Eugene Thompson's barrister, Monye Anyadike-Danes KC, said the family had concluded the murder happened because the authorities were colluding with the "very group that actually perpetrated the killing". She said Eugene was "trying to find out why his younger brother was murdered" and felt a "deep responsibility". Eugene, she added, believed the public should be able to trust that those who kill will be held accountable, especially when they are agents of the state. She asked the judges not to let the NCND policy be used to "conceal the involvement of state parties in the killing of an ordinary citizen". Just before Christmas, the court ruled that the government's assessment of damage to national security "should have been accepted by the coroner" unless it was plainly irrational or there was no supporting evidence. The justices found the coroner had failed to understand it was "solely" for the government to make submissions on national security, not the chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), Jon Boutcher, who had argued for the release of the summary of police files. Paul Thompson's case is part of a battle over the truth and whether it can be told. The battle concerns official secrets, often connected to state agents, and it pits bereaved families and senior police officers against the government and the security service, MI5. It raises a profound question: can the state, especially when it is implicated in killing, be trusted as the arbiter of what should remain secret? The spycatcher who was himself a spy Other cases in the coming months will force these issues further into the spotlight – and they come at a time when MI5's integrity is under significant scrutiny. Yet the Supreme Court's ruling in the Thompson case creates a precedent that says the government and MI5 can withhold information from bereaved families, for national security reasons, even when the police want it to be disclosed. Grainne Teggart, from Amnesty International, described it as a "grim day for truth" and part of a pattern of "national security being used as a shield to cover up and conceal the state's role in very serious crimes such as murder and other serious human rights violations." The government, by contrast, welcomed the court's "unanimous judgment". "This is a highly complex case with wide-ranging implications," it said. "The government will therefore take time to fully consider all aspects of this judgment." During the Troubles, the state made widespread use of informants, otherwise known as agents, who were tasked with carrying out actions and often paid. Agents existed in the IRA and in loyalist paramilitary groups. They were run by the police, the army, and MI5. The former Met Police chief Lord Stevens, who led UK government-commissioned investigations into collusion in Northern Ireland between the 1980s and 2000s, once said that of 210 people arrested during his enquiries, only three were not state agents. Collusion occurred in a number of ways, he said, ranging from the state withholding intelligence and evidence from investigators, to state agents being involved in murder. In some cases agents told the authorities in advance about planned attacks but nothing was done to stop them. One of the most notorious agents was codenamed Stakeknife. It has been publicly known for more than 20 years that Stakeknife was a man called Freddie Scappaticci. He died under MI5 protection in 2023 having never been charged with any of the many murders and other crimes to which he is linked. Scappaticci was a senior figure in the IRA's internal security unit, which was tasked by IRA leaders with identifying and killing British agents in the organisation. But, with the spycatcher himself a spy, the result was one British agent killing other agents, or people accused of being agents, and the state repeatedly not intervening to save them. Intelligence agencies and historic wrongdoing A long-running police investigation into Stakeknife, Operation Kenova, was forbidden from officially naming Scappaticci in its final report, published in December, despite the fact that his identity was widely known. The head of the Kenova team, Sir Iain Livingstone, pleaded with Northern Ireland Secretary Hilary Benn for the right to name Scappaticci in his report, but Benn said he would decide after the Supreme Court ruling in the Paul Thompson case, which came later in December. That ruling has, in effect, strengthened Benn's power to stop him being named. If permission is granted, a revised version of the Kenova report can be published. Jon Boutcher, who was Livingstone's predecessor leading the Kenova investigation, has described the situation preventing Scappaticci being named as a "pantomime". It leads to the truth being "suppressed," he argues, with "profound and severe adverse impacts on victims and families, legitimate public discussion and debate, media freedom, open justice and public confidence in state agencies and the criminal justice system". Boutcher, the PSNI chief constable, is involved in a significant and extraordinary stand-off with the government and MI5 over NCND. He has called for reform of the policy, a principle he fully supports but believes is being wrongly applied and has become a dogma that can be used to conceal wrongdoing. He has recommended the policy is reviewed to ensure it is applied proportionately and only where genuinely necessary for the protection of life or national security. The government has not yet responded to the call for a review of the policy. Boutcher has directly asked whether NCND's continued application on Stakeknife amounts to it being used as a tool for covering up things that should never have happened. "I question whether this decision protects agents, or rather does it actually protect the government and intelligence agencies from accountability for historical wrongdoing." In the Paul Thompson case he argued that he, as chief constable, rather than the government, had the right to allow the coroner to release a summary of police files. The high court and court of appeal backed his position before it was ultimately rejected by the Supreme Court. During the hearings, government barrister Sir James Eadie KC said Boutcher was being "thoroughly disingenuous" and that "politics is being played with national security". He argued the government is best placed to make assessments on national security, as only it has access to the full range of necessary advice. The principal advice, in this context, is from MI5. The argument the government is best informed seemed somewhat at odds with the fact the MI5 officer whose sworn statement was provided to support the case had not read the relevant underlying material. For the chief constable of Northern Ireland to be at loggerheads with MI5 is "unprecedented" says veteran investigative journalist, John Ware, who has reported on the Troubles since the 1970s. "If anybody had told me even 10 years ago that there would come a time when the chief constable of the PSNI and the Security Service were at loggerheads, I would have fallen off my stool," he says. Trust, state secrecy and the public Boutcher has a raised a stark question: can the authorities who played a role in the events, including MI5, be trusted to decide whether to tell the public about what happened, when doing so could leave them exposed? He has also indirectly raised this question about the legal system itself - due to its own role in the Stakeknife case. Scappaticci helped create a legal precedent on state secrecy that is routinely cited by the government to this day. In 2003, he sought a judicial review over the then government's refusal to publicly deny media reports that he was Stakeknife. But Scappaticci was bluffing and did not actually want to succeed, since if the government was ordered to tell the truth, he would have been confirmed as Stakeknife. Scappaticci was engaged in a pretence to help shore up his reputation: publicly fighting a legal case, while hoping – and expecting – he would lose. However, the government feared Scappaticci would win because a judge would assume he was not Stakeknife and force ministers to be honest. Jon Boutcher has now confirmed an extraordinary fact: the judge who heard the case did so after being secretly briefed on the real identity of Stakeknife. That judge, the then Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland, Lord Carswell, ultimately allowed the government to maintain NCND, creating the legal precedent on the policy. "The full facts about this and the government's explanation will never be known while it is able to hide behind the shield of NCND," Boutcher has said. There is a second extraordinary fact: the government barrister who did the secret briefing was Philip Sales, who as Lord Sales was one of the Supreme Court justices in the Paul Thompson case. This fact was uncovered by the journalist John Ware. This is an issue because it is Lord Sales' ruling in the Thompson case which has a central bearing over whether Scappaticci can be named and more details revealed about what went on, including Lord Sales' own role. I asked the Supreme Court whether, given Lord Sales' role in the Scappaticci matter, if it was appropriate for him to have heard the Thompson case. In a statement, the court said: "Great care is taken in the selection of the panels which will hear a case at the UK Supreme Court. "A Justice will not deal with a case where it is considered there is a conflict of interest and individual Justices are careful to ensure that they have none." The cases of Seamus Dillon and Sean Brown Two further cases that touch on the potential release of information about the role of the state during the Troubles are also before the Supreme Court. Troubles-related inquests were shut down in 2024 with the passing of the Legacy Act, which created a new body called the Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery (ICRIR) to examine relevant cases, including those being investigated by police. The families of four men who were either killed or injured during the Troubles won a further legal victory, when the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal ruled the government has too much veto power over the disclosure of material by the ICRIR. Lady Chief Justice Siobhan Keegan said that the provision in the Act giving the Northern Ireland secretary "the final say" on disclosure of sensitive national security information by the ICRIR would risk undermining public confidence in the body. The UK government's appeal will be ruled on by the Supreme Court in the coming months. The lead respondent in the case is Martina Dillon, whose husband Seamus was killed in 1997. The paramilitary Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF) claimed responsibility. A coroner had opened an inquest on the basis there was evidence of collusion by state authorities, but the inquest was halted by the Legacy Act. No-one has ever been held accountable. The government has also registered an appeal in another key case. Sean Brown was also murdered in 1997 by members of the LVF. The 61-year-old father-of-six was abducted as he locked the gates at a sports club in County Londonderry. There were investigative failures by police and no-one has been brought to justice. Decades later, a coroner issued a summary of secret material stating that "a number of the individuals linked through intelligence to the murder were agents of the state." Sean's family want a public inquiry, and have won judgments over the past two years at the High Court and Court of Appeal. The government, which was found to have acted unlawfully by refusing a public inquiry, has registered an appeal to the Supreme Court on the basis the issue has constitutional significance regarding who should order inquiries. 'The state viewed itself as above the law' At its heart, this vast battle over secrecy centres on two core claims by the state: that only the government and MI5 can ultimately be fully trusted on national security, and that their decisions on what information to release are solely about protecting the public. But these claims have been undermined by MI5's actions and omissions in several recent cases, all during the leadership of MI5's current director general, Sir Ken McCallum. A public inquiry into the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing, which killed 22 people, concluded that MI5 had not given an "accurate picture" of the key intelligence it held about the suicide bomber who carried out the attack. The inquiry chairman only uncovered what MI5 had done through his own persistent investigations during secret evidence sessions. The government has been resisting calls by families bereaved by the Manchester Arena attack for MI5 officers to be fully included in planned new legislation - known as the Hillsborough Law - that's designed to stop cover-ups and enforce truth-telling by public officials. Another ongoing case is an example of how MI5's evidence cannot always be taken at face value: MI5 gave false evidence to three courts about having maintained its NCND secrecy policy in relation to an abusive neo-Nazi agent who attacked his girlfriend with a machete. But MI5 had in fact told me the man was an agent when attempting to prevent me from investigating him. After MI5 apologised, we then showed that inquiries into what happened by MI5 and the government were deficient and unreliable, with further falsehoods provided to the court. This prompted the most senior judge in England and Wales to dismiss MI5's explanations and led the prime minister to order a new investigation, which will report this year. In the Stakeknife investigation, MI5 disclosed key documents years after enquiries began, aer Scappaticci had died and charging decisions had been made, and at a point when the Legacy Act banned police from investigating further. The new material revealed MI5 had greater and earlier knowledge of Stakeknife than detectives had previously been told, including that MI5 had been involved in tasking him. The lead detective said it was a "significant failure on the part of MI5". A review commissioned by MI5 found no deliberate wrongdoing. Cover-ups and failures to disclose information have a long history in Northern Ireland. Lord Stevens, recalling his investigations, has said: "I was misled deliberately, I was criminally obstructed from doing my job by the Royal Ulster Constabulary and military, whilst MI5 failed to disclose information." Judge Pomerance, who was senior counsel on another major investigation, concluded bluntly: "The state viewed itself as above the law". The battle of bereaved families Last July, days before Eugene Thompson died, Jon Boutcher delivered a letter of apology on behalf of PSNI. He apologised for the police's failure to take action that may have prevented Paul Thompson's murder, and for failures in the investigation, including not properly pursuing suspects. Mark Thompson from Relatives for Justice (no relation of Paul and Eugene Thompson) says the apology was "important" but that Eugene was by this stage "very ill". Mark had watched the Supreme Court hearings with Eugene on a laptop in his hospice and describes the experience as "tough". Eugene was "praying and hoping that before he died the judgment could be made", Mark says. Bereaved families caught up in these cases have had to battle for decades, trying to fill voids left by the lack of proper investigations by the state. "You became an investigator, tracking down witnesses. You became an expert in the law in that field. And you fought your own case tooth and nail." Eugene Thompson became an "accidental lawyer and expert in his own case", he says, as he campaigned for answers about why his brother Paul was murdered. "I think if we take anything from the legacy of him, it's the example of never giving up."
