France debates under-15s social media ban endorsed by Macron France is on course to follow Australia in banning social media to younger teenagers, as debate on a new law opens in the National Assembly. The law would block access for under 15-year-olds to networks such as Snapchat, Instagram and Tiktok. President Emmanuel Macron has said he wants the ban in place by the start of the school year in September. The French move is part of a worldwide trend towards restricting social networks for children, triggered by growing evidence of the damage they can cause to mental health. "We cannot leave the mental and emotional health of our children in the hands of people whose sole purpose is to make money out of them," Macron said last month. Under the new text, the state media regulator would draw up a list of social media networks that are deemed harmful. These would be simply banned for under 15-year-olds. A separate list of supposedly less harmful sites would be accessible, but only with explicit parental approval. The bill is believed to have a good chance of passing, with pro-Macron parties likely to be joined by the centre-right Republicans (LR) as well as the populist right-wing National Rally (RN). Another clause would ban the use of mobile telephones in senior schools (lycées). The ban is already in effect in junior and middle schools. If the law is passed, France will need to agree on the mechanism for for age-verification. A system is already in place that requires over 18 year-olds to prove their age when accessing online pornography. In Europe, Denmark, Greece, Spain and Ireland are also considering following the Australian example. Earlier this month, the UK government launched a consultation on banning social media for under 16s. The basis of the proposed French law is a text drawn up late last year by deputy Laure Miller, who chaired a parliamentary committee enquiry into the psychological effects of TikTok and other networks. Separately, the government was told to draw up its own legislation, after Macron decided to make the issue a centrepiece of his last year in office. The president has been sidelined from domestic politics since the Assembly elections which he called in 2024 resulted in a hung parliament, and the social media ban has been a rare chance to court public favour. For a time the cause risked falling victim to bickering between Macron and his one-time prime minister Gabriel Attal (Miller is an MP from Attal's party). But in the end the government appears to have rallied behind the Miller bill. If the text is approved Monday, it will pass before the upper house, the Senate, in the next month. Macron said he had asked the government of Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu to use a fast-track procedure to get the legislation on the books by September. Without resort to the fast-track (which permits a single reading as opposed to two in each of the two houses), the law would have little chance of getting past the legislative backlog created by Lecornu's difficulties in passing a budget. The bill has already had to be redrafted to take account of questions raised by the Council of State, the body which previews draft legislation to ensure it conforms with French and European law. A 2023 law which proposed a similar ban on social media for young teenagers proved inoperable after courts decided it broke European law.

**Excerpt**

Gunmen storm Mexico football pitch and kill at least 11 people At least 11 people were killed and another dozen injured when gunmen opened fire on locals who had gathered at a football pitch in the city of Salamanca in central Mexico on Sunday. Witnesses said armed men arrived at the grounds in several vehicles and shot at those gathered there seemingly indiscriminately. Many families had stayed behind to socialise after a match between local clubs. At least one woman and one child were among those killed. The motive behind the shooting is not yet clear. Guanajuato, the state in which Salamanca is located, registered the highest number of murders in the whole of Mexico last year. Neighbours reported hearing at least 100 shots ring out as the gunmen opened fire at the Cabañas pitch in the Loma de Flores neighbourhood. Local and federal security forces are now investigating the deadly shooting. It came just a day after several violent incidents in the city, in which a total of five men were killed and another was abducted. Guanajuato has seen a spike in violence committed by a number of gangs that engage in the theft of oil and fuel, as well as other criminal activities such as drug trafficking and extortion. Gang members frequently hold up tanker trucks carrying oil and tap oil pipelines belonging to state-run oil company Pemex. Salamanca, which is home to a major Pemex refinery, has been particularly subject to violent gang-related attacks. Analysts say that the rivalry between the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) and the Cartel de Santa Rosa de Lima (CSRL) is behind many of the most brutal incidents. Their criminal activities are not confined to Mexico, with both the smuggling of stolen fuel and illicit drugs spreading violence into the United States. Last year, the US State Department designated the CJNG as a Foreign Terrorist Organisation and, more recently, placed sanctions on the CSRL. US President Donald Trump has made the fight against criminal gangs sending illicit drugs such as heroin, fentanyl, methamphetamines and cocaine one of his priorities. He has in the past alleged that "cartels are running Mexico" and has threatened to hit "narco-terrorists" with land strikes. The US has already carried out at least 36 strikes against vessels allegedly transporting drugs by sea, both in the Caribbean and the Pacific, killing at least 125 people. Legal experts and Trump's critics have questioned the legality of these strikes. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum last week handed over 37 "high-impact" suspects to the US in what local media described as an attempt by her government to co-operate with US counternarcotic efforts and thereby ward off the possibility of Trump ordering unilateral strikes against the cartels in Mexican territory.

**Excerpt**

EU investigates Elon Musk's X over Grok AI sexual deepfakes The European Commission has launched an investigation into Elon Musk's X over concerns its AI tool Grok was used to create sexualised images of real people. It follows a similar announcement in January from the UK watchdog Ofcom. If the site is found to have breached the rules of EU's under the Digital Services Act, the Commission could fine the company up to 6% of its global annual turnover. A previous statement from X's Safety account said the social media platform had stopped Grok from digitally altering pictures of people to remove their clothing in "jurisdictions where such content is illegal". Regina Doherty, a member of the European parliament representing Ireland, said the Commission would assess whether "manipulated sexually explicit images" have been shown to users in the EU. Campaigners and victims said the ability to generate sexually explicit pictures using the tool should have "never happened", and Ofcom said its investigation would remain ongoing. The EU regulator said it may "impose interim measures" if X refuses to implement meaningful adjustments. It said it had also extended its ongoing investigation launched in December 2023 over risks associated with X's recommender systems - the algorithm that recommends specific posts to users. Before the Commission's announcement, Elon Musk posted a picture on X on Monday appearing to make light of the new restrictions in place around Grok. The X owner has previously criticised those scrutinising the app's image-editing function - particularly the UK government - calling it "any excuse for censorship". On Sunday, the Grok account on X claimed more than 5.5 billion images were generated by the tool in just 30 days. 'Unacceptable form of degradation' Other investigations into the platform's chatbot are underway in Australia, France and Germany. Grok was temporarily banned in Indonesia and Malaysia, although the latter has now lifted the ban. Henna Virkkunen, Executive Vice-President for Tech Sovereignty, Security and Democracy at the Commission called the sexual deepfakes a "violent, unacceptable form of degradation". "With this investigation, we will determine whether X has met its legal obligations under the DSA, or whether it treated rights of European citizens - including those of women and children - as collateral damage of its service," she said. In a statement to Reuters, Doherty said there were "serious questions" over if platforms such as X were meeting legal obligations "to assess risks properly and to prevent illegal and harmful content from spreading". "The European Union has clear rules to protect people online," she said. "Those rules must mean something in practice, especially when powerful technologies are deployed at scale. "No company operating in the EU is above the law." The move comes a month after the EU fined X €120m (£105m) over its blue tick badges, saying they "deceive users" because the firm is not "meaningfully verifying" who is behind the account. In response, the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) accused the EU regulator of attacking and censoring US firms. "The European Commission's fine isn't just an attack on X, it's an attack on all American tech platforms and the American people by foreign governments," he said. His remarks were reposted by Musk, who added "absolutely".

Private jet carrying eight crashes in Maine A private jet carrying eight people has crashed while taking off from Bangor International Airport in the US state of Maine, aviation authorities have said. The Bombardier Challenger 600 went down at around 19:45 local time (00:45 GMT on Monday), the Federal Aviation Administration said, but the fate and identities of those on board were not immediately clear. The incident came as a dangerous winter storm barrelled across a large swathe of the US, killing several people and leaving hundreds of thousands without power. Pilots had reportedly been struggling with visibility at the airport before the crash. Bangor remains under a winter storm warning until Tuesday, with heavy snowfall forecast. Bangor International Airport said following the incident that it had closed and that emergency crews were responding, urging members of the public to avoid the area. Audio from air traffic control, reported by the BBC's US partner CBS News and published by LiveATC.net, captured discussions between controllers and pilots minutes before the crash concerning poor visibility, though it is unclear which aircraft were heard in the communications. Shortly afterwards, a controller was heard saying there was "a passenger aircraft upside down". Images from the scene showed smoke and flames on the runway. The disruption came amid widespread travel chaos due to the storm, with more than 11,000 flights cancelled and nearly 5,500 delayed across the US on Sunday, according to tracker FlightAware. Airports in Philadelphia, Washington DC, Baltimore, North Carolina, New York and New Jersey were among those affected. Between 10 and 16 inches (25-40cm) of snow is forecast to accumulate in parts of Maine, including Bangor, by Tuesday morning, according to the National Weather Service.

**Excerpt**

Israel to reopen Gaza crossing after search for last dead hostage's body ends Israel says it has agreed to reopen the Gaza Strip's key border crossing with Egypt only after an operation to retrieve the body of the last remaining Israeli hostage in the territory is complete. The Rafah crossing has been mostly closed since May 2024, when the Palestinian side was seized by Israeli forces. It was meant to have reopened during the first stage of the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, which began in October. However, the Israeli government has made that conditional on Hamas making every effort to return the body of the last hostage, police officer Master Sgt Ran Gvili. On Sunday, Israel's military said it had begun a new search for his remains in northern Gaza. Although in its latest announcement Israel appears to offer a timeframe for the reopening of the crossing, it is not known how long the search for Gvili will take. Israeli media quoted military officials as saying the operation was taking place at a cemetery in Gaza City and that it could last several days. On Thursday, the head of the new technocratic Palestinian government in Gaza said the Rafah crossing would open "in both directions" this week. It comes as US and other mediators continue to press both sides to take the next steps to advance President Donald Trump's peace plan. On Sunday night, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office announced that Israel had "agreed to a limited reopening of the Rafah crossing for pedestrian passage only, subject to a full Israeli inspection mechanism". The Israeli military was "currently conducting a focused operation to exhaust all of the intelligence that has been gathered in the effort to locate and return" the remains of Ran Gvili, a statement said. "Upon completion of this operation, and in accordance with what has been agreed upon with the US, Israel will open the Rafah crossing," it added. Israel's Haaretz newspaper cited a source as saying there would be a "full Israeli monitoring mechanism" at the crossing, which would include oversight of entry and exit lists. Israel also planned to establish an additional screening point for all people entering Gaza located in an area around the Yellow Line, which demarcates the territory still controlled by Israeli forces under the ceasefire deal, the source added. Earlier on Sunday, the Israeli military said troops had "begun a targeted operation in the area of the Yellow Line in the northern Gaza Strip" to retrieve Gvili's body. Israeli military officials told local media that the operation was acting on intelligence collected over a long period of time, which indicated that Gvili's remains might have been buried in the Shejaiya and Daraj Tuffah areas of Gaza City, east of the Yellow Line. Specialised units were on the ground, including rabbis, search teams and dental experts equipped with mobile X-ray machines, they added. Hamas's military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, said on Sunday that it had "provided mediators with all the details and information in our possession regarding the location" of Gvili's body. Israeli forces were "searching one of the sites," it added. Gvili's family meanwhile reiterated their strong opposition to the reopening of the Rafah crossing before his body had been returned to Israel for burial. "First and foremost, Ran must be brought home," they said. The 24-year-old was killed in Kibbutz Alumim during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023 and his body was taken back to Gaza as a hostage. At the start of December, the Israeli government said the Rafah crossing would open "in the coming days" to allow Palestinians to leave Gaza. However, a dispute emerged with Egypt, which said the crossing would only be opened if movement was allowed in both directions, enabling the return of tens of thousands of Palestinians who fled Gaza during the war. On Saturday, US special envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner led a delegation which met Israel's prime minister for discussions focused on the implementation of phase two of the Gaza peace plan. Witkoff said the meeting was "constructive and positive". Under phase one, Hamas and Israel agreed to the ceasefire, an exchange of all living and dead Israeli hostages in Gaza for Palestinians detained in Israeli jails, a partial Israeli withdrawal, and a surge in deliveries of humanitarian aid. Phase two should see a new technocratic Palestinian government in Gaza take over running public services, as well as the reconstruction and full demilitarisation of the territory, including disarmament of Hamas and other groups. The war was triggered by the 7 October 2023 attack, when about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others taken to Gaza as hostages. Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 71,650 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

**Excerpt**

Uganda's military chief denies army assaulted Bobi Wine's wife Uganda's military chief Muhoozi Kainerugaba has denied claims that soldiers assaulted Barbara Kyagulanyi, the wife of opposition leader Bobi Wine, during a raid at their home. Wine, who is in hiding, alleged on Saturday that his wife was held at gunpoint by military officers who assaulted her, taking away documents and electronic items. He said the house continued to be surrounded by the military. Speaking from hospital, Barbara Kyagulanyi said the officers had demanded to know Wine's whereabouts and had assaulted her when she refused. It comes after the recent landslide victory of long-serving leader, and Kainerugaba's father, President Yoweri Museveni. Wine rejected the results citing fraud. On Monday, the general posted on X that "my soldiers did not beat up Barbie [Bobi Wine's] wife". "First of all, we do not beat up women. They are not worth our time. We are looking for her cowardly husband not her," he said. Since Museveni was announced the winner of the 15 January election, the military chief has demanded Wine's surrender and has issued death threats against him. Wine said on Monday that Kainerugaba was still looking for him "and issuing threats to harm me" and thanked the people for continuing to keep him safe. "My wife is still recovering from the trauma of an overnight raid and assault... My home is still surrounded by the military," he added in a post on X. From her hospital bed, Barbara Kyagulanyi had described how dozens of men had broken into her house, some in military uniform, harassing and assaulting her. She said one of the men "hit me on the face and tore my lip". She said the officer had lifted her from behind by the waistband of her trousers while another choked her as she hung mid-air. She said the first officer pulled off her blouse, leaving her partially naked, though it was later given back. She said the officer also pulled her hair and "hit me on the face and tore my lip". Barbara Kyagulanyi said she passed out after the ordeal. According to Wine, she was taken to hospital "with both physical and psychological trauma". Since the election, the opposition has alleged that its supporters have been targeted by the security forces. Kainerugaba said on Friday that security officers had killed 30 supporters of the opposition National Unity Party (NUP) led by Wine and detained 2,000 others. Lawmaker Muwanga Kivumbi, who is a close Wine ally, was arrested for his alleged role in election-related violence last week, which the party denied. The Uganda Law Society denounced the "ongoing wave of detentions, torture and enforced disappearance" of opposition leaders and supporters". "No-one should be subjected to violence by security forces under the pretext of national security," the society said on Sunday. Uganda has not witnessed a peaceful transfer of presidential power since independence. Museveni first came to office as a rebel leader in 1986 and will have served for 45 years when the next term ends in 2031. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

**Excerpt**

Tearful goodbyes as Japan returns pandas to China amid worsening ties Thousands of people flocked to a zoo in Japan on Sunday to say farewell to the country's last two giant pandas, who are set to return to China on Tuesday. Emotions ran high at the Ueno zoo in Tokyo as people stood in line – some for as long as three-and-a-half hours – to see twin cubs Xiao Xiao and Lei Lei one last time. This comes at a very tense moment in relations between Tokyo and Beijing. Ties have sharply deteriorated after Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said Tokyo would get involved militarily if China attacked Taiwan. The twins' departure will leave Japan without any pandas for the first time since 1972, the year the two countries normalised diplomatic ties. The People's Republic of China has used giant pandas as a gesture of goodwill towards its international allies and competitors since it was founded in 1949. But China retains ownership of all pandas it loans to foreign countries, including cubs born abroad. In return, host countries pay an annual fee of about $1m (£790,000) per pair of pandas. According to Tokyo's metropolitan government, some 108,000 people vied to get one of the 4,400 slots available for one last look at the zoo's beloved pandas. "I have been bringing my son here since he was a baby, so I hope it becomes a good memory for him. I'm glad we could come today to remember them," Ai Shirakawa told the BBC. Another woman recalled witnessing the pandas' growth journey. "Witnessing their growth, especially since they were so small, has been such a joy," she said. Some visitors were pictured sobbing as they bade the bears goodbye. Xiao Xiao and Lei Lei were born in 2021 at the Ueno zoo to their mother Shin Shin and their father Ri Ri, both of whom were on loan to Japan for breeding research. More recently, China's panda loans have coincided with major trade agreements. In 2011, the loan of two pandas to Edinburgh Zoo in Scotland was agreed during negotiations over contracts to supply salmon meat, Land Rover vehicles and energy technology to China. Many pandas have been returned to China in recent years – a loan agreement typically lasts 10 years although extensions are common. However, the prospects of a new panda loan to Japan have remained uncertain amid the escalating row. Japanese prime minister Sanae Takaichi's comments on Taiwan angered Beijing which views the self-governed island as part of its territory and has not ruled out the use of force to "reunite" with it. Both sides have since engaged in increasingly hostile actions and rhetoric towards each other. Early this month, China tightened restrictions on exports of rare earth-related products to Japan.

Tributes pour in across India for revered BBC broadcaster Sir Mark Tully Tributes have been pouring in for veteran BBC journalist Sir Mark Tully who has been cremated in the Indian capital, Delhi, a day after he died at the age of 90. Hundreds of people - including friends and family - gathered at the Lodhi crematorium to bid their final goodbye to the broadcaster. Sir Mark was widely regarded as the BBC's "voice of India" and was one of the most admired foreign correspondents of his generation. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi described Sir Mark as "a towering voice of journalism", adding that "his connect with India and the people of our nation was reflected in his works". On Monday afternoon, mourners lined up around Sir Mark's body at the crematorium. Wrapped in a white cloth, his body was laid on a platform on a bed of flowers, made up of rose petals and tuberoses. Marigold garlands and a wreath were placed on top. Christian priests recited prayers and hymns were sung, before the body was taken for cremation. Sir Mark, who died on Sunday at a Delhi hospital where he was undergoing treatment, has been described as a "chronicler of modern India". Over a career spanning several decades, he reported on big historical moments that defined South Asia's trajectory, including the Indian army's storming of the Sikh Golden Temple, the birth of Bangladesh, periods of military rule in Pakistan, the Tamil Tigers' rebellion in Sri Lanka and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. In 1992, while reporting on the demolition of the Babri mosque by Hindu hardliners, he faced threats from a mob and was locked in a room for several hours before a local official and a Hindu priest came to his aid. Journalist Satish Jacob, who worked closely with Sir Mark at the BBC for nearly two decades and later co-authored a book with him, said he first met him on a flight in 1978, an encounter that "marked the beginning of a friendship that lasted 48 years". In a personal tribute, Jacob recalled one of his fondest memories of his friend, from the night India won the 1983 Cricket World Cup. "The match had been over 30 minutes before and we were on the terrace on a warm summer night in June while our Old Delhi mohalla [locality] was celebrating the win," he wrote on Facebook, adding that he soon heard Sir Mark's distinctive voice shouting, "Hum jeet gaya!" - meaning "we have won". "There was Mark standing outside my house with a bottle of our favourite whiskey dancing in the street celebrating India's victory." Author and historian William Dalrymple called Sir Mark a "giant among journalists and the greatest Indophile of his generation". "As the voice of BBC India he was irreplaceable, a man prepared to stand up to power and to tell the truth, however uncomfortable," Dalrymple wrote in a post on X. Senior journalists and academics across India have also spoken about Sir Mark's influence on them and the impact of his reporting. Political scientist Pratap Bhanu Mehta wrote in The Indian Express newspaper that it "used to be joked that all Indians have a 'Sir Mark memory'". Mehta was a high school student when Sir Mark covered the 1984 anti-Sikh riots. When there was little reliable information, Sir Mark's despatches became the "only voice of Indian history as it happened", he recalled. "It was only Sir Mark's voice, each evening, speaking with controlled despair, that provided any coherent picture of what was unfolding. There was something about the soft, rhythmic lilt of his delivery that paradoxically made the horror he described even more vivid," he added. "During his decades of reporting for the BBC, he was the most recognised and trusted radio voice in India, at a time when the only real alternative was the completely government-controlled All India Radio," veteran journalist Coomi Kapoor wrote. Journalist Shekhar Gupta recalled how his mother wouldn't accept that "Dacca [Bangladesh's capital Dhaka] had fallen in December 1972" until she heard it on the BBC. It was a belief shared by millions of Indians, including former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi, who said he would not believe his mother, Indira, had been murdered by her Sikh bodyguards until he tuned in to his short-wave radio and heard BBC confirm it. "As familiar to ordinary villagers as Kashmiri militants and Afghan mujahideen, he was so well known to senior ministers in Delhi that the guards of one simply allowed him to amble through the front door," the Times wrote in its obituary. Born in Calcutta in British India in 1935, Sir Mark spent much of his life in the country. He was knighted for services to broadcasting and journalism in the 2002 New Year Honours list. He also received two of India's highest civilian awards - the Padma Shri and the Padma Bhushan - an uncommon distinction for a foreign national. Additional reporting by Jugal Purohit, BBC Hindi

Greece biscuit factory fire leaves at least four dead At least four people have been killed after a fire broke out at a food factory near the central Greek city of Trikala, the country's fire service says. The blaze began early on Monday at a Violanta biscuit factory, where 13 workers were on site, local media reported. Eight managed to escape. One person remains missing, but the city's deputy mayor for civil protection, Giorgos Katavoutas, told the BBC that "there is no hope of finding any of the missing workers alive, given the force of the explosion and the fire that followed". An investigation into the cause of the blaze is ongoing but unconfirmed reports have suggested a possible gas leak. Television footage showed extensive damage to the factory, with part of the building destroyed, effectively splitting the structure in two. Thick smoke could also be seen billowing from the fire. Violanta said it was "deeply saddened" by the fire. "Today a serious incident occurred at our factory premises, during the night shift, for a currently unknown reason," Violanta said in a statement. "We are fully cooperating with the relevant authorities and providing all available assistance." Health minister Adonis Georgiadis earlier told the Skai news agency that six workers and a firefighter had been taken to hospital, adding that they were "in good health, mainly suffering from respiratory problems". The fire service said more than 50 firefighters and 16 fire trucks had been sent to tackle the blaze. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis referred to the fire during opening remarks at a cabinet meeting on Monday. "Our thoughts are with the families of the victims," he said, adding that the fire service was already investigating the circumstances of the incident" so that "responsibilities can be established".

**Excerpt**

Russia using Interpol's wanted list to target critics abroad, leak reveals Thousands of files provided by a whistleblower at Interpol expose for the first time the extent of Russia's apparent abuse of the international policing agency to target its critics abroad. The data provided to the BBC World Service and French investigative outlet, Disclose, reveals that Russia is using Interpol's wanted lists to request the arrest of people such as political opponents, businessmen and journalists, claiming that they have committed crimes. Analysis of data also suggests that over the past decade, Interpol's own independent complaints unit has received more complaints about Russia than anyone else - three times more than the next highest country, Turkey. In addition, it indicates complaints against Moscow's requests have led to more cases being overturned than for any other country. After Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Interpol introduced extra checks on Moscow's activity "to prevent any potential misuse of Interpol's channels in relation to the targeting of individuals within or beyond the conflict in Ukraine". But the leaked documents suggest these did not prevent Russia abusing the system and the whistleblower told us some stricter measures were quietly dropped in 2025. In response, Interpol says that every year, thousands of the world's most serious criminals are arrested thanks to its operations and that it has a number of systems to avoid misuse which have been strengthened over the last few years. It also says it is aware of the potential impact requests for arrest can have on individuals. "When you're hit with a red notice, your life changes completely," says Igor Pestrikov, a Russian businessman, whose name appears in the leaked files. Interpol is not a global police force itself, but helps police across the world to co-operate. A red notice is an alert to all of its 196 member countries, asking them to locate and arrest a person. A red diffusion is a similar request but is only sent to individual countries. Pestrikov found he was named in a red diffusion after he fled Russia in June 2022 - four months after the invasion of Ukraine - and applied for asylum in France. He felt he had two options: "Go to the police and say, 'I'm in the Interpol system,'" and risk arrest or lie low. This may mean "you can't rent an apartment, your bank accounts get blocked", which is what happened to him, he says. "It's constant nerves, all the time," he adds, explaining he was always looking over his shoulder. For safety, his daughter and her mother moved to another country. The police can "break into your house at any time… that's why you're like a cornered rat", he says. "It's the stress, the nerves, the pressure, the lawlessness inflicted on you," that breaks families apart, he adds. Pestrikov had been a major shareholder in large metals companies in Russia that were privatised in the 1990s, most notably Solikamsk Magnesium Plant. In the months leading up to the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, he says government ministers pressured him to stop selling his products abroad and only supply the Russian market. He believed this would mean his products could be used to make components for military hardware, such as fighter jets and tanks. He says it wasn't just that he was against "having to sell much cheaper and to whoever the ministries told me to" but that "it was a moral issue as well... no-one wanted to get involved even indirectly in the production of something used to kill people". Pestrikov believes his refusal to comply and the fact his wife at the time was Ukrainian led to his companies being nationalised and to Russia investigating him for financial crimes. After he fled to France, he was worried that the Kremlin might try to target him there, so he contacted Interpol and was told about the red diffusion request, which had passed the agency's checks. Pestrikov decided to challenge it through Interpol's internal, independent watchdog, the Commission for the Control of Interpol's Files (CCF), arguing that Russia's request was politically motivated. Interpol's constitution expressly states that the organisation cannot be used "to undertake any intervention or activities of a political, military, religious or racial character". After Pestrikov had spent almost two years on the wanted list, the CCF ruled that his case was predominantly political. He showed us CCF documents that said the information Russia had provided was "generic and formulaic" and there had been an "inadequate explanation" of the alleged crime. Interpol cancelled the request for Pestrikov's detention. Interpol only releases very basic data about illegitimate requests for arrests and since 2018 has not revealed which countries are the subject of complaints and inquiries. This lack of transparency makes it difficult to assess the scale of the problem, but for the first time, the leaked documents reveal a much fuller picture. One batch of files shared with the BBC contains a list of complaints sent to the CCF. The data is not complete, but it covers a broad range of countries, and where the nation requesting an arrest is listed, there are more complaints about Russia than anywhere else - this has been the case for the past 11 years. The files also show that in the past decade, at least 700 people who were wanted by Russia complained to the CCF, and at least 400 of them had their red notices or diffusions overturned - that is more than for any other country, according to the data we received. "Historically it has been Russia who is one of the main perpetrators of abusive red notices," says British barrister Ben Keith, who has represented many clients wishing to have their names removed from Interpol's wanted lists. He thinks Interpol has a particular problem with Russia and that the agency's attempts to prevent abuse have not been successful. He says that he has "a steady flow of clients who are subject to Russian red notices who are either politically connected, or often pro-Ukraine, or alternatively as a result of corporate raiding". International lawyer Yuriy Nemets, who specialises in Interpol matters and extradition, agrees that Interpol's extra scrutiny of Russia's requests for arrests, introduced after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, has not proved effective. He says he is aware of a number of cases in which Russians opposed to the war "have been targeted for speaking out against what's going on and were charged with financial… or other ordinary crimes and put into the database based on that". "It's not hard to game the system," he adds. As well as information on notices and complaints, the Interpol insider also provided the BBC with thousands of messages sent between individual countries via Interpol's messaging system, revealing another, less formal route to trace people abroad. One message from Moscow to law enforcement agents in Abu Dhabi explained how Interpol had denied a request for a red notice, but that it still wanted help in tracing the subject's whereabouts. This goes against Interpol advice that members should not use its channels in this way. The leak also contains a message about Armen Aramyan, a journalist who had fled Russia after he was convicted of "engaging minors in dangerous activities" for reporting on student protests that supported the opposition leader Alexei Navalny in January 2021. Aramyan went to Armenia and then on to Germany. The message from Russia to law enforcement entities in both countries sidestepped the more formal red notice and red diffusion process, and asked for "any useful information" about Aramyan as well as his whereabouts. The message was sent in February 2023, during the time Russia was under restrictive measures and its messages were being checked before being sent. We can't say for sure whether the message was delivered, but based on the source of the data, the whistleblower believes that it was. When the BBC showed Aramyan a copy of the message, he said he was shocked but not surprised. "I don't think they expected that Germany [would] send them my address, my phone number, and extradite me, but if they could at least get some sort of tiny bits of information it would still be valuable for them." The leak contains other messages in which a foreign law enforcement agency responds to Moscow's request for information. It sent details about the movements of an ally of Navalny, Lyubov Sobol, and high-profile defector Gleb Karakulov. The exchange relating to Karakulov happened after Interpol announced its additional vetting of Moscow. The BBC also gained access to internal Interpol reports from 2024 and 2025 which show ongoing concern around Russia's activities from senior directors within the organisation. In one, a senior figure expresses directly to Russian delegates "serious concerns" about the country's "wilful misuse" of Interpol systems, stating that there were instances of "flagrant violations" of Interpol rules. Despite the extra restrictions on Russia, the reports show that approximately 90% of Russia's requests were still passing initial checks in 2024. And yet, in the same period, the CCF was overturning roughly half of all Russian requests that it received complaints about. This raises questions about whether the measures had been stringent enough. One report describes how in 2024 Russia attempted to place red diffusions on judges and a prosecutor at the International Criminal Court, after the body issued arrest warrants for President Vladimir Putin and another government official for their actions in Ukraine. These requests from Moscow were rejected. Even while concerns about Russia's misuse of Interpol's systems were being expressed inside the organisation, the reports also show that discussions were taking place in 2024 and 2025 about whether to remove additional restrictions on Russian activity. This seems to have been settled in Moscow's favour. The whistleblower told the BBC that in 2025 Interpol quietly dropped some extra measures against Russia — it is not clear how far this softening may have gone. Despite repeated requests, Interpol said it was not able to comment due to its "strict rules on the processing of data". The BBC was unable to disclose all the details of the leak to Interpol as doing so could reveal the source. However, when asked about the issues raised in the investigation, Interpol said it was "concerned that a number of the accusations seems to come from a misunderstanding of how Interpol and CCF systems work, or factual errors about data and changes within Interpol's systems". "It is untrue to say that we prioritise police co-operation over preventing abuse – Interpol follows its constitution that expressly forbids the use of our systems on information that is of a predominantly political, military, religious or racial character." And in the past, it has said it can do more good to prevent crimes by ensuring that lines of communication remain open. We asked Russia's ministry of internal affairs for comment, but it did not respond. Lawyers Yuriy Nemets and Ben Keith agree that Interpol should do more to prevent misuse of its systems. "If countries are found to be significantly and persistently abusing red notices and diffusions, then they should be suspended from the system for a period of time," says Keith. Otherwise, Igor Pestrikov fears that Russia, "with the push of a button, can enter anything, pin any crime on you - this lets them persecute you further around the world".

Japanese ex-soldier reaches settlements in landmark sex abuse case Rina Gonoi, the former soldier who was sexually assaulted while serving in Japan's Self-Defense Forces (SDF), has reached a settlement with two remaining defendants - the state and an ex-colleague. Her attorney said on Monday that Gonoi will receive 1.6 million yen ($10,400; £7,600) from the Japanese government, but no compensation or apology from the former colleague. It marks the end of Gonoi's civil lawsuit against five ex-soldiers and the government in a case that has drawn international attention. She reached settlements with four of the five earlier. A 2023 ruling in a separate criminal case found three of the ex-soldiers guilty of sexual assault. Gonoi's case was a landmark one in Japan, where it is rare for victims of sexual violence to speak out. She put her story on YouTube in 2022. But public discussions about sexual violence have increased in recent years, following high-profile cases like journalist Shiori Ito's court battle against her alleged rapist and the expose of J-pop giant Johnny Kitagawa. Gonoi said at a press conference on Monday that she experienced a "very long and heavy time" since speaking out more than four years ago. "During these 4.5 years I came to understand first-hand just how heavy the weight of speaking up is," she said. "Even so, I did not regret speaking out," she added. Earlier this month, the 26-year-old wrote on X that her years-long legal battle had "come to an end" and thanked everyone who had supported her during the journey. Gonoi had sought 5.5 million yen ($40,000; £32,000) in damages from the men for causing her mental distress, and an additional 2 million yen from the state for its failure to prevent abuse. Warning: This article contains graphic descriptions of sexual assault In 2022, Gonoi posted a video on YouTube that garnered attention both in Japan and abroad. She alleged that in 2021, three of her male colleagues had pinned her down and pressed their crotches against her. She said her complaints to her superiors were dismissed. As Gonoi's story went viral, more than 100,000 people signed a petition calling for the defence ministry to investigate her allegations of sexual violence during her time in service. The case also prompted a sweeping investigation into the ranks of the SDF, where defence ministry officials uncovered more than 1,000 other reports of sexual harassment. Her three attackers were convicted of sexual assault and handed two-year prison sentences in 2023. But the sentences were suspended for four years, which means they did not actually have to serve time in prison.

**Excerpt**

Who was Alex Pretti, the intensive care nurse shot dead in Minneapolis? A man who was shot dead by federal agents in Minneapolis has been identified by his family as 37-year-old intensive care nurse Alex Pretti. He has been described as an avid outdoorsman who loved mountain biking and is understood to have joined protests after Renee Good, also 37, was shot dead by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent in her car earlier this month. Conflicting accounts have emerged about the moments leading up to his death. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said an agent fired in self-defence after Pretti, who they claim had a handgun, resisted attempts to disarm him. Some eyewitnesses and officials, as well as Pretti's family, have challenged that account. Videos show no evidence to support the claim he used any armed force to threaten agents. Pretti worked as an ICU nurse at the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs hospital, his family said in a statement. They told the Associated Press news agency (AP) that he was upset by US President Donald Trump's crackdown on immigration in the city. Pretti's mother also said her son cared immensely about the Trump administration's rollback of environmental regulations. "He hated that, you know, people were just trashing the land," Susan Pretti told AP. She added: "He was an outdoorsman. He took his dog everywhere he went. You know, he loved this country, but he hated what people were doing to it." Pretti had no interactions with law enforcement beyond traffic tickets, family say Pretti loved adventures with his beloved Catahoula Leopard dog Joule, who died around a year ago, AP reported. His family said he had no interaction with law enforcement beyond a handful of traffic tickets. According to AP, court records show he had no criminal record. Pretti's parents, who live in Wisconsin, said they had also recently told their son to be careful while protesting. "We had this discussion with him two weeks ago or so, you know, that go ahead and protest, but do not engage, do not do anything stupid, basically," his father Michael Pretti told AP. "And he said he knows that. He knew that." Pretti's family also explained he owned a handgun and had a permit to carry a concealed handgun in Minnesota - but they had never known him to carry it. Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara also said police believed he was a lawful gun owner with a permit to carry, the BBC's US partner CBS reported. 'Please get the truth out about our son' After seeing videos suggesting their son was a "domestic terrorist," Pretti's family issued a statement saying "the sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting". They claimed videos showed Pretti was not holding a gun when he was tackled by federal agents. "Please get the truth out about our son. He was a good man," they urged in their statement. Pretti was a Democratic voter and had taken part in the wave of street protests after George Floyd was killed by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020, his ex-wife told AP. She said that he was someone who may shout at law enforcement officers at a protest but had never known him to be physically confrontational. A US citizen born in Illinois, Pretti grew up in Green Bay, Wisconsin, where he played football, baseball and ran track for Preble High School. He was a Boy Scout and sang in the Green Bay Boy Choir. He went to the University of Minnesota, graduating in 2011 with a bachelor's degree in biology, society and the environment, according to his family. He worked as a research scientist before returning to education to qualify as a registered nurse. His parents said their last conversation with their son was a couple of days before he was shot dead when they spoke about repairs he had done to the garage door at his home, AP reported. A Latino man had completed the work and Pretti's parents said with all that was happening in Minneapolis he gave the man a $100 (£74) tip. Doctor Dmitri Drekonja, who worked with Pretti, told ABC News the pair had bonded over their interest in mountain biking and would compare notes on which trails to ride. "He was the type of person you enjoyed being around and the notion that this helpful, smiling joking guy was being labelled a terrorist? It's galling," he said. Neighbours described Pretti as quiet and warmhearted. "He's a wonderful person," Sue Gitar told AP, who lived downstairs from the nurse and said he moved into the building about three years ago. "He has a great heart." Pretti lived alone and worked long hours as a nurse, but he was not a loner, his neighbours said. "I never thought of him as a person who carried a gun," said Gitar.

**Excerpt**

NRA and other US gun activists push back at Trump officials over Minneapolis shooting The National Rifle Association (NRA) has joined other US gun lobby groups in calling for a "full investigation" by the Trump administration into the killing of Alex Pretti in Minnesota. Comments from the NRA come after a border agent fatally shot Pretti - registered nurse at a Veterans Affairs hospital - in Minneapolis on Saturday. State and federal officials have given starkly different accounts. The Trump administration has said Pretti carried a gun and posed a danger to officers - while no available video shows Pretti holding a gun. The NRA labelled a suggestion by a federal prosecutor that people who carry guns risk being lawfully shot by officers as "dangerous and wrong". "Responsible public voices should be awaiting a full investigation, not making generalisations and demonising law-abiding citizens," the NRA said in a statement. The NRA - which is typically aligned with Donald Trump - was reacting to comments from First Assistant US Attorney for the Central District of California on Saturday night. Bill Essayli wrote on social media: "If you approach law enforcement with a gun, there is a high likelihood they will be legally justified in shooting you. Don't do it!" In a separate social-media post, the NRA said: "As there is with any officer-involved shooting, there will be a robust and comprehensive investigation that takes place to determine if the use of force was justified. "As we await these facts and gain a clearer understanding, we urge the political voices to lower the temperature to ensure their constituents and law enforcement officers stay safe." Essayli's comments have drawn criticism from other gun advocacy groups, as well as politicians from across the spectrum. Gun Owners of America said in a statement: "The Second Amendment protects Americans' right to bear arms while protesting - a right the federal government must not infringe upon." Republican Thomas Massie said: "Carrying a firearm is not a death sentence, it's a constitutionally protected God-given right, and if you don't understand this you have no business in law enforcement or government." In a follow-up social media post, Essayli accused critics of taking his comments out of context. "I never said it's legally justified to shoot law-abiding concealed carriers," he said on X. "My comment addressed agitators approaching law enforcement with a gun and refusing to disarm." For the second time this month, federal agents have been involved in a fatal shooting in Minneapolis linked to a crackdown on illegal immigration by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency. Bystander video footage has captured the moments before Pretti was shot on Saturday. The altercation that led to Pretti's shooting was recorded from many points of view and federal and state officials have given conflicting accounts. The Department for Homeland Security shared an image of a gun it claimed belonged to Pretti and said he was a threat to officers. On Saturday, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was asked to clarify if Pretti had brandished a gun and said agents fired what she called "defensive shots" while trying to disarm Pretti. "They responded according to their training, and took action to defend the officer's life and those of the public around him. And, I don't know of any peaceful protester that shows up with a gun and ammunition rather than a sign." Minnesota Governor Tim Walz branded the Trump administration's version of events "nonsense" and "lies." Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey likened the federal operation to an invasion and accused ICE of "trying to spin this as an action of self-defence".

**Excerpt**

'I spent £2,000 on one event': Why Gen Z is obsessed with Hyrox Hyrox is a fitness craze that shows no signs of dying out - with 1.3m people expected to compete in an event somewhere in the world this year. The competition, which is split between running and fitness exercises, has proven particularly popular with young millennials and Generation Z - people in their twenties to early forties. Its rapidly growing popularity has been attributed to social media. Fashionable looks are often a non-negotiable for competitors, with many choosing to compete in high-end fitness brands, matching their outfits with their team members. Allana Falconer, who works in sustainability and started competing in 2023, says she has "fallen in love" with it. She has competed in 20 different races across six countries and 12 different cities. "All my holidays revolve around Hyrox or I incorporate events into holidays," she tells the BBC World Service. The 29-year-old says the most she has spent so far was £2,000, when she travelled to Chicago for the World Championships last year. Exercise is part of their identity "For competitions abroad, I normally spend approximately £400 per trip for two nights' stay and travel and £120 for a ticket," she adds. As she is racing so much, she says she needs lots of fitness kit too, adding that "I burn through ridiculous amounts of shoes." Evgenia Koroleva, the founder of ONE LDN gym, says for anyone that takes fitness competitions seriously, "the costs can be absolutely astronomical". She estimates an athlete travelling to compete in a Hyrox competition will spend between "£500 to £1,000" in one weekend, with the ticket alone about £120. "Hyrox has created this addiction for people who do it because they never really do one race. When they do their first race they then sign up for another one and because the course is the same it creates this level of competition with yourself," she adds. The cost of participation is higher than a marathon, and some people have criticised it. "Travelling abroad plus the costs involved to run around a bit and get out of breath is a stretch for me," said one former participant on Reddit. Fran Sirl, personal trainer and owner of parkfit, who runs outdoor fitness classes in Richmond Park, says sports like this can feel intimidating and says he reminds his clients you don't need specialist kit or equipment to get fit. "I take groups out into the park. Sometimes we start out with a walk, then add lunges and push-ups on a bench. "Exercise doesn't need to be expensive or complicated. It's about finding something that makes you want to go back and do it again, whether that's a high intensity workout or just going for a walk." Most athletes the BBC spoke to felt the prices for Hyrox were fair due to the cost of hiring large event spaces, specialist equipment and judging panels. Evgenia says the fact people are willing to pay so much reflects a wider "cultural shift" in how much people in their 20s and 30s spend on exercise. "Exercise is non-negotiable and part of their identity," she adds. Spending money on fitness is a priority for those born between 1997 and 2012 (Gen Z), according to exercise app Strava. Its survey suggests that a third of them plan to spend more on fitness this year with almost two thirds saying they would rather spend money on new gym clothes than a date. "Mara-cations" (marathon vacations) and Hyrox holidays are now so popular that some travel companies are offering bespoke trips abroad for competitions. In Hyrox, UK competitions often sell out quickly, which is why many of those wanting to take part travel further afield. Hyrox, which hosted its first competition in 2021, has a near 50/50 gender split. The race involves doing a one-kilometre run eight times, broken up with exercises such as burpee broad jumps, sled pulls and rowing. Those taking part can compete on their own or with a partner - either in a mixed or same sex team. Dr Florence Kinnafick, a senior academic at Loughborough University who specialises in physical activity and mental health, says the different disciplines can mean competing becomes "addictive". The "emphasis on competition isn't attractive to everybody," she says. Kinnafick also warns of a risk of overtraining, if people get "obsessed" with improving their time. But when it comes to the exercises themselves, she says whilst it is a hard event, there's nothing "particularly technical" making it safe for newcomers. 'I've caught the bug' Jorell Hill, who has competed in 10 races so far, says he has "definitely caught the bug". "I did my first one [Hyrox] in December 2024 and since then I haven't been been on a single holiday abroad that hasn't been for a half marathon, marathon or Hyrox." The 27-year-old, who fits his training around his job as a firefighter, says his life "used to be going out, seeing mates, going to the pub and drinking a lot" but now nearly all his holidays involve "fitness retreats and competitions". He has travelled to "six or seven different countries for competitions" and hopes to compete in America and further afield this year. Jorell, who moved to London just over a year ago, has made most of his friends through fitness. "Instead of spending money on going out clothes, I'm just buying new fitness kit," he says.
