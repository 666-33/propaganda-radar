Iran protesters defy crackdown as videos show violent clashes Protesters in Iran defied a deadly government crackdown on Saturday night, taking to the streets despite reports suggesting hundreds of people have been killed or wounded by security forces in the past three days. Verified videos and eyewitness accounts seen by the BBC appeared to show the government was ramping up its response, as it continues an internet blackout. The country's attorney general, Mohammad Movahedi Azad, said on Saturday that anyone protesting would be considered an "enemy of God" - an offence that carries the death penalty. More than 2,500 people have been arrested since protests began on 28 December, according to a human rights group. The protests were sparked by soaring inflation, and have spread to more than 100 cities and towns across every province in Iran. Now protesters are calling for an end to the clerical rule of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Khamenei has dismissed demonstrators as a "bunch of vandals" seeking to "please" US President Donald Trump. Trump has threatened to hit Iran "very hard" if they "start killing people". Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf on Sunday warned that if the US attacks Iran, Israel and all US military and shipping bases in the region will be legitimate targets for Iran to attack. As protests intensify, the number of deaths and injuries continues to rise. BBC sources and US-based Human Rights Activists in Iran (HRANA) have reported more than 100 people, including security personnel, killed. Staff at three hospitals told the BBC they have been overwhelmed with the injured and dead, with BBC Persian verifying 70 bodies brought to one hospital in Rasht city on Friday night and a health worker reporting around 38 people dying at a Tehran hospital. The BBC and most other international news organisations are unable to report from inside Iran, and the Iranian government has imposed an internet shutdown since Thursday, making obtaining and verifying information difficult. Nonetheless, some video footage has emerged, and the BBC has spoken to people on the ground. Verified video from Saturday night showed protesters taking over the streets in Tehran's Gisha district. Several videos, confirmed as recent by BBC Verify, show clashes between protesters and security forces in Mashhad, Iran's second largest city. Masked protesters are seen taking cover behind wheelie bins and bonfires, while a row of security forces is seen in the distance. A vehicle that appears to be a bus is engulfed in flames. Multiple gunshots and what sounds like banging on pots and pans can be heard. A figure standing on a nearby footbridge is visible in the footage and appears to fire multiple gunshots in several directions as a couple of people take cover behind a fence on the side of Vakil Abad Boulevard. Another verified video shows a large group of protesters and the sound of banging on pots in Punak Square in west Tehran. A clip filmed in the Heravi district in north-east Tehran, confirmed by BBC Persian and BBC Verify, shows a crowd of protesters marching on a road and calling for the end of the clerical establishment. Internet access in Iran is largely limited to a domestic intranet, with restricted links to the outside world. But during the current round of protests, authorities have, for the first time, not only shut down access to the worldwide internet but also severely restricted the domestic intranet. An expert told BBC Persian the shutdown is more severe than that imposed during the "Women, Life, Freedom" uprising in 2022. Alireza Manafi, an internet researcher, said internet access in Iran, in any form, was now "almost completely down". He added the only likely way to connect to the outside world was via Starlink satellite internet, but warned users to exercise caution, as such connections could potentially be traced by the government. US 'ready to help' On Saturday, Trump wrote on social media: "Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. The USA stands ready to help!!!" He did not elaborate, but US media reported that Trump had been briefed on options for military strikes in the country. The New York Times and Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported the briefings had taken place, with WSJ describing them as "preliminary discussions". An unnamed official told the WSJ there was no "imminent threat" to Iran. Last year, the US conducted airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. As dawn broke on Sunday in Iran, Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran's last shah (king), who lives in the US and whose return protesters have been calling for, posted a video to X. Its caption said: "Know that you are not alone. Your compatriots around the world are proudly shouting your voice... In particular, President Trump, as the leader of the free world, has carefully observed your indescribable bravery and has announced that he is ready to help you." He added: "I know that I will soon be by your side." He claimed the Islamic Republic was facing a "severe shortage of mercenaries" and that "many armed and security forces have left their workplaces or disobeyed orders to suppress the people". The BBC could not verify these claims. Pahlavi encouraged people to continue protesting on Sunday evening, but to stay in groups or with crowds and not "endanger your lives". Amnesty International said it was analysing "distressing reports that security forces had intensified their unlawful use of lethal force against protesters" since Thursday. UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said those speaking out against Khamenei's government should not face "the threat of violence or reprisals". At least 78 protesters and 38 security personnel have been killed in the past two weeks, HRANA reported. BBC Persian has confirmed the identities of 26 people killed, including six children. A hospital worker in Tehran described "very horrible scenes", saying there were so many wounded that staff did not have time to perform CPR, and that morgues did not have enough room to store the bodies. They said many people died "as soon as they reached the emergency beds... direct shots to the heads of the young people, to their hearts as well. Many of them didn't even make it to the hospital." The protests have been the most widespread since an uprising in 2022 sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish woman who was detained by morality police for allegedly not wearing her hijab properly. More than 550 people were killed and 20,000 detained by security forces over several months, according to human rights groups. Additional reporting by Soroush Pakzad and Roja Assadi

One person dead and 300 buildings destroyed in Australia bushfires One person has died and 300 homes and buildings have been destroyed in bushfires that have torn across south-east Australia. The fires have raged in dozens of locations across the country for several days, mostly in the state of Victoria, but also in New South Wales, burning through land almost twice the size of Greater London. A state of emergency has been declared in Victoria as thousands of firefighters and more than 70 aircraft battled the blaze. Residents in more than a dozen communities have been advised to leave their homes. The authorities fear the blazes, which are being fuelled by very hot, dry and windy conditions, could burn for several weeks. Victoria's Premier, Jacinta Allan, said 30 active fires were burning across the state, ten of which were a particular concern. She said 350,000 hectares had been burnt across the state as of 08:00 local time on Sunday (23:00 GMT on Saturday). "We will see fires continue for some time across the state and that is why we are not through the worst of this by a long way," she told Australian media. "There are fires that are continuing right now that are threatening homes and property." Human remains were found in the village of Gobur, near the town of Longwood, some 110km (70 sq miles) north of the state capital Melbourne, police said. The victim has not yet been identified. Allan praised the emergency workers who worked to retrieve the body. "This is difficult and confronting work, and it takes a heavy toll." "The Gobur community is grieving," Allan said. Bushfire smoke is impacting air quality in many areas across Victoria, including metropolitan Melbourne. Authorities said the fires were the worst to hit the south-east of Australia since the 2019-2020 blazes that destroyed an area the size of Turkey and killed 33 people. One of the worst-hit places is the small town of Harcourt in the central highlands of Victoria, where firefighter Tyrone Rice lost his home in the blaze. He was out fighting one of the bushfires when he learned his own home was on fire. He told Australian media it was "like a kick in the guts, but I'm not the first person to go through it, and I won't be the last". The destruction in Harcourt was "gut-wrenching", the local fire captain Andrew Wilson said. A reporter for Australia's 9 News, Jack Ward, told BBC World Service he had visited the damage in several towns across Western Australia. What he saw was "catastrophic", he said, and in many places, "all that's left of these houses is a tin roof lying on the ground".

**Excerpt**

Last Kurdish forces leave Aleppo after ceasefire deal reached The final Kurdish fighters have withdrawn from the Syrian city of Aleppo, after the announcement of a ceasefire deal in the early hours of Sunday morning. Mazloum Abdi, leader of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), said an agreement had been made via international mediation, securing the safe evacuation of "martyrs, the wounded, the trapped civilians and the fighters" from the city. Buses carrying the last Kurdish-led SDF members were seen leaving the Kurdish majority neighbourhood of Sheikh Maqsoud, according to local media reports. The latest clashes in Aleppo started earlier this week, after negotiations to integrate the Kurds into Syria's new government reached a stalemate. At least 12 people were killed in the latest outbreak of violence, which also saw tens of thousands of civilians displaced after they were forced to flee Sheikh Maqsoud and Ashrafieh. The Syrian army shelled the area on Wednesday afternoon after designating the neighbourhoods "closed military areas", in response to what it alleged were attacks by armed groups in the area. The Kurdish-led SDF - which insists it has no military presence in Aleppo - called it a "criminal attempt" to forcibly displace residents. A ceasefire was raised earlier in the week, but Kurdish forces refused to leave the last stronghold of Sheikh Maksoud under the deal. In March 2025, the Kurdish-led SDF, which controls much of Syria's north-east and has tens of thousands of fighters, signed a deal to integrate all military and civilian institutions into the Syrian state. Both sides accusing each other of trying to derail the negotiations that followed, with the agreement still not realised almost a year later. The newest iteration of the ceasefire agreement was mediated by the US and other world powers, following concern that the stand-off in Aleppo risked Turkey's involvement. Turkey backs the Syrian government and considers the Kurdish militia that dominates the SDF a terrorist organisation. In a post to X on Saturday, the US ambassador to Turkey and special envoy to Syria, Tom Barrack, said he had met the Syrian president and urged all parties to "exercise maximum restraint, immediately cease hostilities, and return to dialogue" in accordance with the March agreement. He added that the US has welcomed Syria's "historic transition", and would extend its support to President Ahmed al-Sharaa as he "works to stabilize the country".

Author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's family accuse hospital of negligence over son's death The family of Nigerian novelist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie has accused a hospital of negligence over the death of her 21-month-old son. Nkanu Nnamdi died at a hospital in Nigeria on Wednesday following a short illness, leaving the family of the acclaimed postcolonial feminist writer "devastated". Now, the family allege there was a litany of failures at Euracare Hospital in Lagos that led to the toddler's death, including being denied oxygen and being given too much sedation, causing a heart attack. The hospital expressed its "deepest sympathies" over the loss of the child but denied improper care, which it said had been in line with international standards. It added that Nkanu had arrived at the hospital "critically ill" and that an investigation into the death was now under way. Adichie's sister-in-law, Dr Anthea Nwandu, made a series of allegations about the hospital in an interview with Nigerian broadcaster Arise TV on Saturday. In it, she said the medical director of Euracare had told Adichie her son "had received too much sedation", which subsequently caused him to have a heart attack. Dr Nwandu also accused medical staff of leaving the child unattended, denying him oxygen and transporting him in a manner that was "not according to standard practice". She alleged Nkanu suffered a brain injury due to lack of oxygen. Similar accusations concerning Nkanu's care were made in a private message from Adichie that was leaked online. Her spokeswoman Omawumi Ogbe told the BBC that the message had originally been shared within "a close circle of family and friends", and "was not for public consumption". Ms Ogbe continued: "While we are saddened that such a deeply personal account of grief and trauma was leaked, the details therein highlight the devastating clinical failures the family is now forced to confront. "We hope that the substance of that message, detailing the gross medical negligence that led to this tragedy remains the central focus even as we look forward to the truth and accountability." Nkanu was one of twin boys Adichie shared with her husband, Dr Ivara Esege. Responding to the allegations, Euracare Hospital acknowledged the "profound and unimaginable loss" the family was experiencing, but said in a statement on Saturday that "reports currently being circulated contain inaccuracies". It said Nkanu, who was critically ill, had been referred to the hospital after receiving treatment from two paediatric centres, and that upon arrival staff "immediately provided care in line with established clinical protocols and internationally accepted medical standards, including the administration of sedation". It continued: "In the course of his care, we worked collaboratively with external medical teams as recommended by his family and ensured that all necessary clinical support was provided." However, "despite these concerted efforts", the boy died less than 24 hours after arriving at the hospital, it added. A "detailed investigation" was under way, Euracare said, adding that it remained "committed to engaging transparently and responsibly with all clinical and regulatory processes". Adichie, 48, had her first child, a daughter, in 2016. Her twin boys were born using a surrogate in 2024. The award-winning US-based writer is known for works including Half of a Yellow Sun, Americanah and her 2012 Ted Talk and essay We Should All Be Feminists, which was sampled by Beyoncé on her 2013 song Flawless. Nigeria's president was among those to have expressed their condolences over the death of Nkanu. The African nation's health system has suffered of late from a severe shortage of doctors, leaving healthcare staff working long hours and doctors juggling jobs in both public and private hospitals. Responding to the allegations concerning Nkanu, an adviser to the Lagos State government said it "places the highest value on human life and maintains zero tolerance for medical negligence or unprofessional conduct". Dr Kemi Ogunyemi, Special Adviser to the Lagos State Governor on health matters, confirmed the state's health watchdog had commenced a "thorough, independent and transparent" investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death. "Any individual or institution found culpable of negligence, professional misconduct, or regulatory violations will face the full wrath of the law," Dr Ogunyemi said. She urged members of the public to avoid speculation over the death while the official investigation was ongoing.

Rescuers race to find dozens missing in deadly Philippines landfill collapse Rescue workers are racing to find dozens of people still missing following a landslide at a landfill site in the central Philippines that occurred earlier this week, an official has said. Mayor Nestor Archival said on Saturday that signs of life had been detected at the site in Cebu City, two days after the incident. Four people have been confirmed dead so far, Archival said, while 12 others have been taken to hospital. Conditions for emergency services working at the site were challenging, the mayor added, with unstable debris posing a hazard and crew waiting for better equipment to arrive. The privately-owned Binaliw landfill collapsed on Thursday while 110 workers were on site, officials said. Archival said in a Facebook post on Saturday morning: "Authorities confirmed the presence of detected signs of life in specific areas, requiring continued careful excavation and the deployment of a more advanced 50-ton crane." Relatives of those missing have been waiting anxiously for any news of their whereabouts. More than 30 people, all workers at the landfill, are thought to be missing. "We are just hoping that we can get someone alive... We are racing against time, that's why our deployment is 24/7," Cebu City councillor Dave Tumulak, chairman of the city's disaster council, told news agency AFP. Jerahmey Espinoza, whose husband is missing, told news agency Reuters at the site on Saturday: "They haven't seen him or located him ever since the disaster happened. We're still hopeful that he's alive." The cause of the collapse remains unclear, but Cebu City councillor Joel Garganera previously said it was likely the result of poor waste management practices. Operators had been cutting into the mountain, digging the soil out and then piling garbage to form another mountain of waste, Garganera told local newspaper The Freeman on Friday. The Binaliw landfill covers an area of about 15 hectares (37 acres). Landfills are common in major Philippine cities like Cebu, which is the trading centre and transportation gateway of the Visayas, the archipelago nation's central islands.

'There wasn't even time for CPR': Iran medics describe hospitals overwhelmed with dead and injured protesters Staff at three hospitals in Iran have told the BBC their facilities are overwhelmed with dead or injured patients, as major anti-government protests continue. A medic at one Tehran hospital said there were "direct shots to the heads of the young people, to their hearts as well", while a doctor said an eye hospital in the capital had gone into crisis mode. Two of the medical workers who spoke to the BBC said they treated gunshot wounds from both live ammunition and pellets. On Friday, the US repeated that killing protesters would be met with a military response. Iran blamed the US for turning peaceful protests into what it called "violent subversive acts and widespread vandalism". Reacting to the latest developments, President Trump posted on social media: "Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. The USA stands ready to help!!!" Warning: This article contains graphic descriptions of death and injury The protests began in the capital Tehran a fortnight ago over economic hardship. They have since spread to more than 100 cities and towns across all of Iran's provinces. Hundreds of protesters are believed to have been killed or injured, and many more detained. BBC Persian has confirmed the identities of 26, including six children. Members of the security forces have also been killed, with one human rights group putting the number at 14. BBC Persian has verified that 70 bodies were brought to Poursina Hospital in Rasht city on Friday night. The morgue there was at full capacity, so the bodies were taken away. The authorities asked the relatives of the dead for 7 billion rials (£5,222; $7,000) to release them for burial, a hospital source said. The BBC and most other international news organisations are unable to report from inside Iran, and the country has been under a near-total internet blackout since Thursday evening, making obtaining and verifying information difficult. A hospital worker in Tehran described "very horrible scenes", saying there were so many wounded that staff did not have time to perform CPR. "Around 38 people died. Many as soon as they reached the emergency beds... direct shots to the heads of the young people, to their hearts as well. Many of them didn't even make it to the hospital. "The number was so large that there wasn't enough space in the morgue; the bodies were placed on top of one another. "After the morgue became full, they stacked them on top of one another in the prayer room," she said. The hospital worker said the dead or wounded were young people. "Couldn't look at many of them, they were 20-25 years old." A doctor who contacted the BBC via a Starlink satellite connection on Friday night said Tehran's main eye specialist centre, Farabi Hospital, had gone into crisis mode with emergency services overwhelmed. Non-urgent admissions and surgeries were suspended and staff called in to deal with emergency cases, he said. Iran's security forces often use shotguns which fire cartridges filled with pellets during confrontations with protesters. 'I saw one person who had been shot in the eye' Another doctor from the city of Kashan in central Iran told the BBC many injured protesters had been hit in the eyes, and that his colleagues in hospitals across the city reported receiving many wounded people during Friday night's unrest. Thursday night produced similar accounts. A doctor at a medical centre in Tehran told the BBC: "The number of injured people and fatalities was very high. I saw one person who had been shot in the eye, with the bullet exiting from the back of his head. "Around midnight, the centre's doors were closed. A group of people broke the door and threw a man who had been shot inside, then left. But it was too late - he had died before reaching hospital and could not be saved." The BBC also obtained a video and audio message from a medic at a hospital in the south-west city of Shiraz on Thursday, who said large numbers of injured were being brought in, and the hospital did not have enough surgeons to cope with the influx. What footage is emerging from Iran shows protesters in Tehran taking to the streets en masse on Friday night, burning vehicles, and a government building set alight in Karaj, near the capital. The Iranian army has since said it will join security forces in defending public property. It follows reports that Iranian security forces were spread thin as the unrest extended throughout the country. Iranian authorities issued a series of co-ordinated warnings to protesters on Friday, with the National Security Council saying "decisive" legal action would be taken against "armed vandals". Iranian police maintained that no one was killed in Tehran on Friday night, though they said 26 buildings were set on fire, causing extensive damage. An eyewitness who joined the protests on Thursday and Friday nights in Tehran told BBC Persian Television that Gen Z Iranians have been instrumental in encouraging their parents and older people to come out and join the protest marches, urging them not to be afraid. EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said on Saturday that Europe backed Iranians' mass protests and condemned the "violent repression" against demonstrators. UN spokesman Stéphane Dujarric said on Friday the international body was very disturbed by the loss of life. "People anywhere in the world have a right to demonstrate peacefully, and governments have a responsibility to protect that right and to ensure that that right is respected," he said. French President Emmanuel Macron, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz released a joint statement on Friday calling on Iranian authorities to "allow for the freedom of expression and peaceful assembly without fear of reprisal". Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei remained defiant in a televised address on Friday, saying: "The Islamic Republic came to power through the blood of several hundred thousand honourable people and it will not back down in the face of those who deny this." In later remarks broadcast on state television, Khamenei reiterated that his regime "will not shirk from dealing with destructive elements" who he said were "trying to please the president of the US". Meanwhile, the son of Iran's last shah, who was deposed by an Islamic revolution in 1979, described the protests as "magnificent" and urged Iranians to continue over the weekend. "Our goal is no longer just to take to the streets. The goal is to prepare to seize and hold city centres," Reza Pahlavi said in a social media video. US-based Pahlavi also said he was preparing to return to the country. But former UK ambassador to Iran Sir Simon Gass told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that "we really shouldn't get too ahead of ourselves" when discussing regime change. He said the lack of organised opposition within Iran meant people did not have an alternative figure to coalesce around as things stood. However, he noted the protests were "a much wider movement" than previous flare-ups, which were triggered by Iranians finding it "almost impossible to make ends meet because of the disaster to the economy". On Friday, President Trump reiterated his threat to Iran's leadership that the US would "hit them very hard" if they "start killing people". He clarified that this did not mean "boots on the ground". Last year, the US conducted air strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. Meanwhile, the US state department said accusations by Iran's foreign minister that Washington and Israel were fuelling the protests were a "delusional attempt to deflect" attention from the challenges the regime was facing. Taghi Rahmani, an Iranian political activist who spent 14 years in prison and whose wife, Nobel Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi, was re-arrested in December, said any lasting change must come from Iranians instead of foreign intervention. The protests have been the most widespread since a 2022 uprising sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, who was detained by morality police for allegedly not wearing her hijab properly. More than 550 people were killed and 20,000 detained, according to human rights groups. Additional reporting by Soroush Negahdari, Mallory Moench and Aleks Phillips
