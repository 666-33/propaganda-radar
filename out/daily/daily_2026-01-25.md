What we know about fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by federal agents in Minneapolis Federal agents shot and killed a man in Minneapolis on Saturday, the second person to be fatally shot in the city during the Trump administration's immigration enforcement crackdown this month. Local officials identified the man as 37-year-old Alex Pretti, a US citizen who lived in Minneapolis and worked as a nurse. Videos have emerged showing a scuffle between Border Patrol agents and the man in the lead up to the shooting. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said the agents fired in self-defence after Pretti, who they say had a handgun, resisted their attempts to disarm him. Eyewitnesses, local officials and the victim's family have challenged that account, pointing out he had a phone in his hand, not a weapon. His parents accused the administration of spreading "sickening lies" about what happened. "Please get the truth out about our son," they added. The incident, which came two weeks after the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good by an immigration agent, has led to further protests and renewed calls from local leaders for federal agents to leave the city. Here is what we know so far. What happened in the moments before the shooting? The shooting occurred on Saturday morning near Nicollet Avenue and 26th Street in south Minneapolis at 9:05 local time (15:05 GMT). Greg Bovino, the Border Patrol commander, said agents had been carrying out a "targeted" immigration enforcement operation when Pretti approached agents with a "9mm semi-automatic" handgun. Bovino did not specify if Pretti was brandishing the gun, but said agents attempted to disarm him and he "violently resisted". The commander said a Border Patrol officer then "fired defensive shots". Videos from the moments before the shooting show Pretti filming agents with his phone in the middle of the street. Whistling and shouting can be heard from bystanders in the background. From one angle, an agent appears to push a woman. When the camera pans back to Pretti, he is seen with his arm around her. The agent then pushes back a second woman. At the same time, Pretti reaches his arm out and stands between her and the agent. The agent then sprays a substance in his eyes. Pretti turns his face away and reaches one open hand up in the air. He appears to be clutching a phone in the other. No gun is visible. Another video from a different angle shows the agent grabbing Pretti by the arm, before more agents get involved. Pretti is brought to the ground, with at least six agents on top of him. One agent can be seen striking at his head. Another officer, who appears to approach the scuffle with empty hands, pulls back with what appears to be a gun in his hand. As he moves away toward a vehicle, a split second later another agent standing beside him opens fire. The agents jump back from the man lying on the ground and the firing continues. A total of 10 gunshots are heard. What do we know about the gun? After the shooting, DHS shared a photo of a firearm on social media, which they said belonged to Pretti. The agency also said he had two magazines of ammunition and no ID. Bovino told reporters it looked like a "situation where an individual wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement". He did not provide any further evidence. Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said at a news conference that Pretti was believed to be a lawful gun owner with a permit to carry. His only previous interactions with law enforcement, as far as police are aware, were related to parking tickets. In a sign of the tensions between federal and local authorities, the police chief also said the DHS had not provided his team with "any specific details" about the deadly incident itself. Later, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was asked to clarify if Pretti had brandished a gun. She said: "Individuals showed up to impede a law enforcement operation and assaulted our officers. "They responded according to their training, and took action to defend the officer's life and those of the public around him. And, I don't know of any peaceful protester that shows up with a gun and ammunition rather than a sign." Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, a Democrat, said he understood the risk of people trying to bear witness and document the actions of federal agents. "Thank God, thank God, we have video because, according to DHS, these seven heroic guys took an onslaught of a battalion against them or something. It's nonsense, people. It is nonsense, and it's lies." Pretti's parents ask for the 'truth' to be told Alex Pretti's parents Michael and Susan have called for "the truth" to be told about their son, after he was shot dead in the confrontation with federal immigration officers. "We are heartbroken but also very angry," they said in a family statement, according to several US outlets. "The sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting." They added that videos showed Pretti was not holding a gun when he was tackled by federal agents. Instead, they said, he was holding his phone with one hand and using the other to shield a woman who was being pepper-sprayed. "Alex was a kindhearted soul who cared deeply for his family and friends and also the American veterans whom he cared for as an ICU nurse at the Minneapolis VA hospital. "Alex wanted to make a difference in this world. Unfortunately he will not be with us to see his impact. "Please get the truth out about our son. He was a good man."

**Excerpt**

Party backed by generals set for landslide as 'sham' Myanmar election ends Polls in Myanmar have closed after a third and final stage of voting in what are widely viewed as sham elections. Many popular parties are banned from standing and voting has not been possible in large areas of the country because of a five-year-long civil war. The dominant party backed by the ruling military junta is expected to win a landslide victory. The current regime has rejected international criticism of the election, maintaining that it is free and fair. Around one-fifth of the country's 330 townships, including the cities of Yangon and Mandalay, voted in the last stage. Six parties, including the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), fielded candidates nationwide, while another 51 parties and independent candidates decided to contest state and regional levels. Two previous rounds were held on 28 December and 11 January - giving overwhelming victories to the USDP. The party won only 6% of parliamentary seats in the last free election in 2020. As in previous rounds of this strange, month-long election, voting was orderly and peaceful at the polling station in Nyaungshwe, Shan State, which a BBC team observed. Set in a large school, shaded by huge rain trees, there were ample volunteers an officials to guide voters where to go, and how to make their choice using the new, locally-made electronic voting machines. You could be forgiven for believing this was a normal democratic exercise, not the sham its critics say it is. However polling day was preceded by a campaigning period marked by fear, intimidation and a pervasive sense that little will change after the inevitable victory by the USDP. Everywhere the BBC team travelled in southern Shan State, we were followed and closely monitored by dozens of police and military officials, always polite but very persistent. It proved nearly impossible to get people to say anything about the vote, so nervous were they of possible repercussions. The next steps after final results are announced are laid down in the military-drafted constitution. Parliament will meet within the next two months to choose a new president, and everyone expects that to be the coup leader Gen Min Aung Hlaing. It will be the same regime with civilian clothes. But he will then have to relinquish his command of the armed forces. His replacement is certain to be a loyalist, but his hold over the ranks of the military will inevitably be less secure, and it is no secret that many other senior officers do not believe he has made a good job of leading the country. With many more voices in politics, there is the possibility of wider debate inside government over which direction Myanmar should now take, and the possibility - distant for now - of the first steps towards ending the civil war. The military junta took control of Myanmar in a 2021 coup, ousting an elected civilian government led by Nobel Peace Prize Winner Aung San Suu Kyi. She remains in detention and, like many other opposition groups, her National League for Democracy has been formally dissolved. The military has been fighting against both armed resistance groups which oppose the coup and ethnic armies that have their own militias. It lost control of large parts of the country in a series of major setbacks, but clawed back territory this year enabled by support from China and Russia. The civil war has killed thousands of people, displaced millions more, destroyed the economy and left a humanitarian vacuum. A devastating earthquake in March and international funding cuts have made the situation far worse.

**Excerpt**

Sir Mark Tully, the BBC's 'voice of India', dies aged 90 The broadcaster and journalist Sir Mark Tully - for many years known as the BBC's "voice of India" - has died at the age of 90. For decades, the rich, warm tones of Sir Mark were familiar to BBC audiences in Britain and around the world - a much-admired foreign correspondent and respected reporter and commentator on India. He covered war, famine, riots and assassinations, the Bhopal gas tragedy and the Indian army's storming of the Sikh Golden Temple. In the small north Indian city of Ayodhya in 1992, he faced a moment of real peril. He witnessed a huge crowd of Hindu hardliners tear down an ancient mosque. Some of the mob - suspicious of the BBC - threatened him, chanting "Death to Mark Tully". He was locked in a room for several hours before a local official and a Hindu priest came to his aid. The demolition provoked the worst religious violence in India for many decades - it was, he said years later, the "gravest setback" to secularism since the country's independence from Britain in 1947. "We are sad to hear the passing of Sir Mark Tully," Jonathan Munro, Interim CEO of BBC News and Current Affairs, said in a statement. "As one of the pioneers of foreign correspondents, Sir Mark opened India to the world through his reporting, bringing the vibrancy and diversity of the country to audiences in the UK and around the world. "His public service commitments and dedication to journalism saw him work as a bureau chief in Delhi, and report for outlets across the BBC. Widely respected in both India and the UK, he was a joy to speak with and will be greatly missed." India was where Sir Mark was born - in what was then Calcutta (now Kolkata) in 1935. He was a child of the British Raj. His father was a businessman. His mother had been born in Bengal - her family had worked in India as traders and administrators for generations. He was brought up with an English nanny who once chided him for learning to count by copying the family's driver: "that's the servants' language, not yours", he was told. He eventually became fluent in Hindi, a rare achievement in Delhi's foreign press corps and one which endeared him to many Indians for whom he was always "Tully sahib". His good cheer and evident affection for India won him the friendship and trust of many of the top rank of the country's politicians, editors and social activists. Throughout his life, he performed a balancing act: English, without doubt; but not - he insisted - an expat who was passing through India. He had roots there; it was his home. It's where he lived for three-quarters of his life. Immediately after World War Two, at the age of nine, Sir Mark came to Britain for his education. He studied history and theology at Cambridge and then headed to theological college with the aim of being ordained as a clergyman before he - and the church - had second thoughts. He was sent to India for the BBC in 1965 - at first as an administrative assistant, but in time he began to take on a reporting role. His broadcasting style was idiosyncratic, but his strength of character and his insight into India shone through. Some critics said he was too indulgent of India's poverty and caste-based inequality; others admired his clearly expressed commitment to the religious tolerance upon which independent India was anchored. It's "really important to treasure the secular culture of this country, allowing every religion to flourish," he told an Indian newspaper in 2016. "... we must not endanger this by insisting on Hindu majoritarianism". Sir Mark was never an armchair correspondent. He travelled relentlessly across India and neighbouring countries, by train when he could. He gave voice to the hopes and fears, trials and tribulations, of ordinary Indians as well as the country's elite. He was as comfortable wearing an Indian kurta as in a shirt and tie. He was expelled from India at 24 hours' notice in 1975 after the then prime minister, Indira Gandhi, ordered a state of emergency. But he headed back 18 months later and had been based in Delhi ever since. He spent more than 20 years as the BBC's head of bureau in Delhi, leading the reporting not simply of India but of South Asia, including the birth of Bangladesh, periods of military rule in Pakistan, the Tamil Tigers' rebellion in Sri Lanka and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Over time, he became increasingly out of step with the BBC's corporate priorities, and in 1993 he made a much-publicised speech accusing the then director general, John Birt, of running the corporation by "fear". It marked a parting of the ways. Sir Mark resigned from the BBC the following year. But he continued to broadcast on BBC airwaves notably as presenter of Radio 4's Something Understood, turning back to issues of faith and spirituality which had engaged him as a student. Unusually for a foreign national, Sir Mark was accorded two of India's top civilian honours: the Padma Shri and the Padma Bhushan. Britain too gave him recognition. He was knighted for services to broadcasting and journalism in the 2002 New Year's honours list. He described the award as "an honour to India". He continued to write books about India - essays, analyses, short stories too, sometimes in collaboration with his partner, Gillian Wright. He lived un-ostentatiously in south Delhi. Sir Mark never gave up his British nationality but was proud also to become late in life an Overseas Citizen of India. That made him, he said, "a citizen of the two countries I feel I belong to, India and Britain".

**Excerpt**

Germany arrests suspected Hamas member over alleged attack plot German police have arrested a Lebanese national on suspicion of being a member of Hamas and planning attacks in Europe. The man, named as "Mohammad S", was stopped at Berlin's Brandenburg Airport after arriving from Beirut on Friday evening. Federal prosecutors said that in August 2025 he helped procure 300 rounds of ammunition and was involved in an alleged plot to attack Jewish and Israeli institutions. He is due to be brought before a federal judge who will decide on a pretrial detention. Hamas, which controlled Gaza but has been severely weakened by Israeli operations in the territory, is considered a terrorist organisation by the US, UK, Israel and many other countries. The militant Palestinian group carried out the attacks on Israel in October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 people taken hostage. Since then, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry, more than 70,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli military action. German authorities say "Mohammad S" colluded with "Abed Al G", one of three alleged Hamas members arrested last October over planned attacks on Jewish and Israeli institutions. The three were reportedly arrested while meeting for a weapons handover in Berlin. Two of them are Germany nationals, another is from Lebanon. Around the time of the arrests, police searches also took place in the German cities of Leipzig and Oberhausen, Der Spiegel reported. Separately, in November, German authorities arrested another suspected member of Hamas - also a Lebanese national - near the border with the Czech Republic.

Peace talks on Russia-Ukraine war end as fighting rages The first three-way peace talks between Russia, Ukraine and the US have ended in Abu Dhabi with no apparent breakthrough, as fighting rages. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky raised the possibility of a second meeting as early as next week, while an American official said a new round would begin on 1 February. The two-day talks ended after waves of Russian air strikes targeted Ukraine's badly damaged energy infrastructure, killing one person and injuring 35 others, Ukrainian officials said. Russia accused Ukraine of attacking an ambulance in Ukrainian territory under its control, killing three medics. Later, it reported a Ukrainian missile attack on energy infrastructure in Belgorod. The BBC could not independently verify the reports. The talks in Abu Dhabi were the first trilateral meeting since the Kremlin launched its full-scale invasion of its neighbour in 2022. "The central focus of the discussions was the possible parameters for ending the war," Zelensky posted on X. "I highly value the understanding of the need for American monitoring and oversight of the process of ending the war and ensuring genuine security." All sides had agreed to "report back to their capitals" and co-ordinate further steps with their leaders, he added. "We've agreed that the next round begins next Sunday in Abu Dhabi again," an unnamed US official told reporters. The decision to hold further talks was a "good sign" and and "a lot of work" had been done over the two days of negotiations, the official added. The Russian state news agency Ria-Novosti reported that Moscow remained open to a continuation of dialogue with Ukraine and the US. Vitali Klitschko, mayor of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, said one person had died and four had been wounded by Russian air strikes on Friday night, while the mayor of the city of Kharkiv reported that 31 people had been hurt there. Kyiv's critical infrastructure was damaged, Klitschko said, leaving 6,000 buildings without heating. Temperatures have fallen to around -12C in parts of Ukraine. Zelensky said for his part that "the main target of the Russians" had been the energy infrastructure. In Kharkiv, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said a maternity hospital and a hostel for displaced people had been damaged. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said the "brutal" Russian attack - "cynically" ordered by President Vladimir Putin - had "hit not only our people, but also the negotiation table". He said the "barbaric" overnight assault proved "that Putin's place is not at the board of peace, but at the dock of the special tribunal". Meanwhile, Russia accused Ukraine of a "barbaric crime against the civilian population" of Kherson region, which is partially under Russian control. Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said a clearly marked ambulance carrying a medical team from the Oleshky central district hospital had been attacked by a Ukrainian drone at the entrance to the village of Hola Prystan. All three medics inside were killed, she said. "We emphasise that attacks on civilian medical transport are prohibited by international humanitarian law," she added. On Saturday evening, the governor of Belgorod, Vyacheslav Gladkov, reported that Ukraine had launched its biggest bombardment yet on the city, which lies across the border from Kharkiv. Energy infrastructure was damaged, Gladkov said, but no casualties were caused. US President Donald Trump said last week that Putin had accepted an invitation to join his Board of Peace - an organisation focused on ending global conflicts. Putin has not confirmed this. Russia occupies roughly 20% of Ukraine, including parts of the eastern Donbas region. The Kremlin wants Ukraine to hand over large areas of the territory, but Ukraine has ruled this out. In Davos, Zelensky said: "It's all about the land. This is the issue which is not solved yet." He said that he had reached an agreement with Trump on future US security guarantees for Ukraine in the event of a deal. He gave no detail but said it would need to go before US Congress and the Ukrainian parliament before signing. The day before the talks in Abu Dhabi began, US special envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner met Putin in Moscow. After the four-hour meeting, Kremlin aide Yury Ushakov said: "Vladimir Putin has emphasised Russia's sincere commitment to settling the Ukraine crisis by political and diplomatic means." But he said "bringing about a lasting settlement would be unlikely without addressing the territorial issue based on the formula as agreed in Anchorage". Last August, Trump and Putin met in Anchorage, Alaska to discuss ending the war, resulting in an agreement to allow Russia to take the Donbas region and keep control of the Crimean peninsula, which it annexed in 2014. Zelensky ruled out giving up the Donbas which is made up of Luhansk and Donetsk and is mostly occupied by Russia.

**Excerpt**

China places highest-ranking general under investigation China's defence ministry says it has opened an investigation into the country's highest-ranking general over "grave violations of discipline and the law". The ministry gave no further details about accusations against General Zhang Youxia, who has widely been seen as President Xi Jinping's closest military ally. However in China the accusation of wrongdoing is usually a euphemism for corruption. In its announcement, the ministry said another senior military officer, General Liu Zhenli, was also under investigation. Their removal follows the expulsion of nine top generals in October - one of the largest public crackdowns on the military in decades. Zhang, 75, is a vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC) - the Communist Party group headed by President Xi which controls the armed forces. Zhang also sits on the party's top decision-making body, the 24-person Politburo. His father was one of the founding generals of the Chinese Communist Party. Zhang joined the army in 1968 and is one of only a few senior leaders with combat experience. He was kept in office beyond the customary retirement age for China's military, suggesting President Xi's confidence in him until now. The announcement comes days after rumours appeared that Zhang and Liu could be facing an investigation as they were not present at a high-level party event in December. Since coming to power, President Xi has launched waves of anti-corruption drives through various departments and this campaign has recently focused heavily on the military. He has called corruption "the biggest threat" to the Communist Party and said the fight against it "remains grave and complex". Advocates say the policy promotes good governance, but others believe it has been used as a tool to purge political rivals. With the probe into Zhang and Liu, the CMC is now down from the original seven members to just two: Xi, who is the chairman, and Zhang Shengmin, who is responsible for the military's disciplinary affairs.

**Excerpt**

Cosmetic doctor sorry for picking apart singer Troye Sivan's looks on TikTok A cosmetic doctor who faced a backlash over a video picking apart pop star Troye Sivan's appearance says he "feels terrible" for upsetting the singer - but will continue to post. London-based Dr Zayn Khalid Majeed posted a two-minute clip drawing attention to the 30-year-old's "problem" areas following an appearance at a recent event in Australia. Fans criticised the "unsolicited" advice, and the singer himself responded with an essay explaining how the video had triggered long-held insecurities about his body. Since deleting the video and contacting Sivan to apologise, Majeed tells BBC Newsbeat he will try to make a more positive impact with his content. Sivan, whose career began when he was a teenager, is regarded by many as a poster boy for the "twink" look. The term refers to younger, slim gay men with a boyish look, and Sivan's image appears prominently in Google results and on Wikipedia's definition page. In the video, which compared studio images of the singer with recent footage from a red carpet interview, Majeed said Sivan appeared to be showing signs of "twink death". The cosmetic doctor, who has more than 250,000 followers across platforms, pointed towards several "problem areas", such as shadows and "volume loss" in the singer's face. He then imagined a scenario where Sivan was his patient and listed various cosmetic "improvements" he could opt for, including skin boosters and dermal filler. People on social media and fans of Sivan criticised Majeed's "unsolicited" advice on ways to "retwinkify" himself. The singer himself then got involved, posting on blogging platform Substack about how the video had heightened his insecurities and pushed him towards considering cosmetic surgery. "I've struggled with my body image for a lot of my life, as I'm sure most people have," he wrote. "What good is money and modern medicine if not to fix all of these flaws that this random... plastic surgeon told me I have?" Newsbeat reached out to Majeeed, who said Sivan's response "was incredibly raw and vulnerable". "I felt terrible and it was never my intention to make him feel like that, which is why I reached out to him directly to apologise," he says. Majeed deleted the videos from his TikTok and Instagram, and Sivan later updated his blog to say there were "no hard feelings from [his] side". The doctor admits he can "see how it came across". Majeed says he started creating content to "educate and inform" people, but began to talk about celebrities because viewers seemed to enjoy it. "For every one celebrity video I make, I make five chatty educational videos," he says. But, reflecting on the situation with Sivan, he says he doesn't want to contribute to the "negative beauty standards" that people face. "I have a voice and I need to use it to shape conversations for the better, where we're more body positive and we accept ageing as a natural process," he says. "Sometimes you don't realise the impact that you can have." However, Majeed says he will continue to make videos that analyse celebrity faces because he believes there is an appetite for them. "It is important to demystify surgeries that celebrities have and educate patients," he says. 'It's mind-boggling' Samantha Rizzo, a "skin-positivity" content creator based in New York, says she can see a benefit to posts that seek to "showcase" cosmetic work or provide more information. "I appreciate if you're using your clients and they consent to their before, during, after photos," she tells Newsbeat. "I feel a little icky when they're just taking the celebrity's picture. "Just because they're famous doesn't mean you have the right to just pick them apart." Rizzo, 26, had botox injected into her jaw in the hope it would relieve pain and migraines after watching videos online. But it left her with limited facial movement and she says she regrets doing it. In hindsight, she believes her insecurities were shaped by the content she was "consuming". "The things you can see can skew your perception of yourself so much that it forces your hand for a decision like that," she says. "It's mind-boggling". Irish-born social media personality Keelin Moncrieff says she has concerns about the availability of information on various procedures and the influence it can have on young people. The mum-of-one tells Newsbeat she understands some creators might try to be "transparent" about any work they've had done, but argues it risks acting as an endorsement for the treatment. "People can't make up or fill in the gaps of what they're not seeing behind the scenes," she says. "People think that this is an easy process." Moncrieff, 28, also says that being online comes with unwanted comments about your appearance - something she's experienced. "I remember I got a comment once saying that my hands were really wrinkly," she recalls. "That's something that's never even popped into my brain." When it comes to surgical changes though, she's made her mind up. "Very often I look in the mirror and think: 'Oh, I could get this done, I could get this done'," she says. "I would find that disturbing. I don't want to uphold those standards." Correction: The headline and first paragraph of this story previously described Dr Zayn Khalid Majeed as a cosmetic surgeon. It has been updated to reflect the fact he is registered with the General Medical Council as a doctor, not a surgeon.
