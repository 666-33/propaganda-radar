Video shows moments around fatal shooting of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis Bystander video footage has captured the moments before the killing of 37-year-old Minneapolis man Alex Pretti by federal immigration officers. The confrontation and altercation which led to Pretti's shooting was recorded from multiple points of view. Federal and state officials have conflicting accounts of the events which led to Pretti's death. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem says agents fired "defensive shots" after Pretti "reacted violently", while Minnesota Governor Tim Walz says the account of events from federal authorities is "nonsense" and "lies". The killing comes less than three weeks after American citizen Renee Good was shot dead by an immigration agent in the city

Who was Alex Pretti, the intensive care nurse shot dead in Minneapolis? A man who was shot dead by federal agents in Minneapolis has been identified by his family as 37-year-old intensive care nurse Alex Pretti. He has been described as an avid outdoorsman who loved mountain biking and is understood to have joined protests after Renee Good, also 37, was shot dead by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent in her car earlier this month. Conflicting accounts have emerged about the moments leading up to his death. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said an agent fired in self-defence after Pretti, who they claim had a handgun, resisted attempts to disarm him. Some eyewitnesses and officials, as well as Pretti's family, have challenged that account. Videos show no evidence to support the claim he used any armed force to threaten agents. Pretti worked as an ICU nurse at the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs hospital, his family said in a statement. They told the Associated Press news agency (AP) that he was upset by US President Donald Trump's crackdown on immigration in the city. Pretti's mother also said her son cared immensely about the Trump administration's rollback of environmental regulations. "He hated that, you know, people were just trashing the land," Susan Pretti told AP. She added: "He was an outdoorsman. He took his dog everywhere he went. You know, he loved this country, but he hated what people were doing to it." Pretti had no interactions with law enforcement beyond traffic tickets, family say Pretti loved adventures with his beloved Catahoula Leopard dog Joule, who died around a year ago, AP reported. His family said he had no interaction with law enforcement beyond a handful of traffic tickets. According to AP, court records show he had no criminal record. Pretti's parents, who live in Wisconsin, said they had also recently told their son to be careful while protesting. "We had this discussion with him two weeks ago or so, you know, that go ahead and protest, but do not engage, do not do anything stupid, basically," his father Michael Pretti told AP. "And he said he knows that. He knew that." Pretti's family also explained he owned a handgun and had a permit to carry a concealed handgun in Minnesota - but they had never known him to carry it. Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara also said police believed he was a lawful gun owner with a permit to carry, the BBC's US partner CBS reported. 'Please get the truth out about our son' After seeing videos suggesting their son was a "domestic terrorist," Pretti's family issued a statement saying "the sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting". They claimed videos showed Pretti was not holding a gun when he was tackled by federal agents. "Please get the truth out about our son. He was a good man," they urged in their statement. Pretti was a Democratic voter and had taken part in the wave of street protests after George Floyd was killed by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020, his ex-wife told AP. She said that he was someone who may shout at law enforcement officers at a protest but had never known him to be physically confrontational. A US citizen born in Illinois, Pretti grew up in Green Bay, Wisconsin, where he played football, baseball and ran track for Preble High School. He was a Boy Scout and sang in the Green Bay Boy Choir. He went to the University of Minnesota, graduating in 2011 with a bachelor's degree in biology, society and the environment, according to his family. He worked as a research scientist before returning to education to qualify as a registered nurse. His parents said their last conversation with their son was a couple of days before he was shot dead when they spoke about repairs he had done to the garage door at his home, AP reported. A Latino man had completed the work and Pretti's parents said with all that was happening in Minneapolis he gave the man a $100 (£74) tip. Doctor Dmitri Drekonja, who worked with Pretti, told ABC News the pair had bonded over their interest in mountain biking and would compare notes on which trails to ride. "He was the type of person you enjoyed being around and the notion that this helpful, smiling joking guy was being labelled a terrorist? It's galling," he said. Neighbours described Pretti as quiet and warmhearted. "He's a wonderful person," Sue Gitar told AP, who lived downstairs from the nurse and said he moved into the building about three years ago. "He has a great heart." Pretti lived alone and worked long hours as a nurse, but he was not a loner, his neighbours said. "I never thought of him as a person who carried a gun," said Gitar.

Venezuela frees dozens of political prisoners, human rights group says A leading Venezuelan human rights group says at least 80 political prisoners have been released under pressure from the US. Alfredo Romero, head of Foro Penal, said his group was verifying the identities of those freed from prisons across the country on Saturday - and more releases were likely to take place. It is the latest batch of detainees released since the US seized Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in a raid, and took him to New York to stand trial on drug-trafficking charges earlier this month. On Friday Venezuela's interim President Delcy Rodriguez said more than 600 prisoners had been freed - but Foro Penal says this figure has been inflated. Romero announced the releases on social media. He also posted an image of Foro Penal colleague Kennedy Tejeda who he said had been held in Tocorón prison, west of the capital caracas since August 2024. In a post on X, Foro Penal lawyer Gonzalo Himiob said the number of releases could rise above 80 "as we proceed with verification". Previously, Foro Penal said that many of those freed in recent weeks have not had the charges against them dropped. This has left them in legal limbo and they have been barred from speaking in public, the group said. Before this weekend's developments, the group had confirmed the release of just 156 political prisoners since 8 January. Some domestic opposition figures and at least five Spanish nationals are among those confirmed to have been freed so far. Separately, Rodriguez said she was due to have a call on Monday with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Turk, to ask the UN to verify the lists of those released so far. Human rights groups and activists have long accused the government of using detentions to muzzle critics. The Venezuelan government has denied holding political prisoners, insisting they were arrested for criminal activity. Many were detained after the 2024 presidential election, when Maduro claimed victory despite opponents and many countries disputing the results.

**Excerpt**

People cling to treetops as 'worst floods in a generation' sweep Mozambique Tens of thousands of people in Mozambique are being rescued as rising waters continue to devastate the southern African nation - the worst flooding in a generation. Teams from Brazil, South Africa and the UK have been helping with life-saving rescue operations. "For me, this is the first time I have experienced a calamity of this magnitude. Elders say a similar disaster took place in the 1990s," 24-year-old mechanic Tomaz Antonio Mlau says. Mlau and his family, who live near Marracuene - a town 30km (19 miles) north of the capital, Maputo - woke up to find their house inundated after the Inkomati River burst its banks. "When a rescue boat came a few hours afterwards, we did not hesitate to board it and come to safety in Marracuene town," he said, adding they had to abandon all their belongings and only managed to bring a change of clothes. Mlau, his wife and two children have found refuge at one of six centres - schools and churches - that are so far sheltering about 4,000 people. Many of those gathered at Gwazamutini Secondary School are farmers from the low-lying areas with livestock and rice fields. "We lost everything in the floodwaters, including houses, TV sets, fridges, clothing and livestock - cattle, goats and pigs. Our farms are under water. I am a farmer. I grow quality rice," 67-year-old Francisco Fernando Chivindzi told me. His home is in Hobjana, one of several flooded neighbourhoods between the left bank of the Incomati River and the coastal tourism resort of Macaneta. Marracuene town is on the river's right bank. "The floodwaters reached heights we weren't expecting. We have never experienced this level of flooding in my lifetime," Chivindzi said. "We are happy to be here on higher ground. However, we are very worried that all our belongings were left behind." The farmer expressed his gratitude to the boat owners who came to assist him and his neighbours free of charge - and he urged others to save themselves. "We hear that there are still some people resisting - clinging to treetops and on roofs. I wish they would heed the rescuers and join us here in this temporary shelter. We should value life more than the goods," the father of nine said. This was a view echoed by Shafee Sidat, the mayor of the Marracuene municipality, as he visited Gwazamutini Secondary School on Saturday. "We still have people to rescue, some of whom refuse to abandon the risk areas. That's a challenge. We reckon that more than 10,000 people are affected in Marracuene as a whole," he told me. At least 642,122 people have been affected since 7 January by flooding - particularly in southern and central regions, with 12 deaths recorded so far, according to provisional data from the National Institute for Disaster Risk Management and Reduction. In total 125 people have died in Mozambique since the rainy season began in October. Mayor Sidat fears the situation is likely to get worse because of heavy rain in neighbouring South Africa, the source of the Inkomati River. "We are worried about discharges of a South African dam on the Inkomati River. Our town is the last one downstream," the mayor said. "Before the waters flow into the Indian Ocean, they flood the 'machambas' (farmlands), homes and grazing areas here in the low-lying zones." Some aerial views show water as far as the eye can see. Hundreds of families remain cut off. All vehicles have now been banned from roads between the provinces of Maputo and Gaza to the north. Transport Minister João Matlombe said it was because main roads, in particular the N1 highway which runs the whole length of the country and is the only link to the north, were flooded. The suspension is already leading to shortages and price hikes, including of basic foodstuffs, coconut and fuel - even as far away as the north-western city of Tete, more than 1,500km from Maputo. For those at shelters in Marracuene, food is also a challenge. "There isn't yet enough food to eat," said Aninha Vicente Mivinga, whose two children are aged two and five. "On the first day this Friday, there was almost nothing to eat. It was painful to see children sleeping without anything to eat, except biscuits. Today things improved," she said. Mivinga, who is a police officer and farms in her spare time, described how she was at work in Marracuene town when the floods hit at her home in Hobjana. The 32-year-old had taken the precaution of taking her children to stay with family members who lived on higher ground because of the continuous rain, but even they were affected by the rising waters. "To learn that my children and other members of the family were on floodwaters and at risk of dying was horrific. I was devastated and completely shaken," the officer said. "Eventually my relatives were brought to safety. "It is the first time since I was born that we've been affected by flooding of this dimension." Mivinga said that students were meant to resume classes soon - and she would like the authorities to find permanent alternative accommodation for them. Hundreds of people are currently camping down in the classrooms using a traditional wrap cloth as bedding on which to lie down. "When floodwaters subside, I believe everyone would love to go back home, but it's too risky. If only the authorities could give us another place on safer ground. We would go back to the risky area only for farming purposes but live on safer ground," the police officer said. Education Minister Samaria Tovela has already hinted that the cabinet is to consider rescheduling the start of the 2026 academic year, originally planned to begin next week, "to allow flood victims to continue using them as accommodation centres, especially in the provinces of Maputo and Gaza, the most affected at the moment". Chivindzi, who is not sure that the floodwaters will recede before schools resume, is determined to return home. "We'll restart life from scratch," the farmer says. Mlau, who is unable to get to the garage where he works, is less sure of the future and the risks of starting again in the same place. "Even if waters subside, I am not sure I'll go back there."

Captain of suspected Russian shadow tanker in French custody French officials have taken the Indian captain of a suspected Russian shadow fleet tanker into custody days after the oil tanker was seized. On Thursday, the French navy intercepted the tanker - named the Grinch - which President Emmanuel Macron said was "subject to international sanctions and suspected of flying a false flag". The Grinch had been travelling through the Mediterranean Sea from the Russian Arctic port of Murmansk. It is now moored, under guard, at a southern French port near Marseille. Although Moscow is yet to comment, Macron said on Thursday that the shadow fleet helped to "finance Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine". The office of the Marseille prosecutor office said the rest of the ship's crew members - all also Indians - were being "kept on board" while the 58-year-old captain was taken into custody. "The investigation aims to verify the validity of the flag used by the tanker," prosecutors said. French media report say it was sailing under a Comoros Islands flag. Nautical and air exclusion zones have been established around the anchorage site, officials say. Announcing the seizure on Thursday, Macron said: "We are determined to uphold international law and to ensure the effective enforcement of sanctions." Many Western countries imposed sanctions on Russian energy following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Earlier in January, British armed forces supported a US operation to seize a Russian-flagged tanker in the Atlantic that US officials said had broken sanctions by carrying oil for Venezuela and Russia. Last October, France seized another sanctioned tanker, the Boracay, off its west coast before releasing it a few days later. Shadow fleets are becoming increasingly common, with Venezuela, Iran and Russia all accused of using them to avoid sanctions on oil. Financial intelligence firm S&P Global estimates that one in five oil tankers worldwide are used to smuggle oil from sanctioned countries.

**Excerpt**

Kenya's ex-deputy president alleges assassination attempt in church attack Prominent Kenyan opposition figure Rigathi Gachagua has alleged there was an attempt on his life during a Sunday church service. Gachagua, who was sacked as deputy president in an impeachment trial in 2024, claimed a gang of rogue police officers had attacked the church in Othaya in the central county of Nyeri, using bullets and tear gas. Without providing evidence, he accused his former ally President William Ruto of ordering the attack. Ruto has not commented but Interior Minister Kipchumba Murkomen condemned the violence, calling it unacceptable. The police said an investigation had been launched, adding that no injuries had been reported. Reports to the police indicated that a tear-gas canister had been thrown inside St Peters Anglican Church at 11:00 local time (08:00 GMT) disrupting the service. Several vehicles were reportedly damaged within the church compound, the police added, appealing for witnesses. Gachagua, a wealthy businessman from the central Mount Kenya area and now a vocal critic of the president, said he was escorted to safety by his security team. He had posted photos of the incident on X and later held a news conference where he dismissed suggestions from pro-government bloggers that the attack had been stage-managed. "Where can we get access to tear gas?... Where do we get access to AK-47 assault rifles?" the Democracy for the Citizens Party leader asked. Murkomen said the police chief had promised him that the attackers would be brought to justice. "Violence anywhere, and least of all in a place of worship, is unacceptable," the interior minister said in a post on X. "The police must move without fear or favour and deal decisively with the sponsors and perpetrators of this act without regard to their status in society or political affiliation." According to Kenya's constitution, Gachagua's conviction by the senate means he cannot hold public office again. He had pleaded not guilty to 11 charges of which he was found guilty of five, including inciting ethnic divisions and violating his oath of office. However the politician, popularly known as Riggy G, maintains he will be on the presidential ballot next year as he is appealing and the Supreme Court has not ruled on his impeachment. Ruto and Gachagua were elected on a joint ticket in 2022 - and the partnership helped Ruto win by marshalling support in Mount Kenya, the heartland of the Kikuyu people who are the largest voting bloc in Kenya.

### 7. [Sir Mark Tully, the BBC's 'voice of India', dies aged 90](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4nnp4d064do?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

Sir Mark Tully, the BBC's 'voice of India', dies aged 90 The broadcaster and journalist Sir Mark Tully - for many years known as the BBC's "voice of India" - has died at the age of 90. For decades, the rich, warm tones of Sir Mark were familiar to BBC audiences in Britain and around the world - a much-admired foreign correspondent and respected reporter and commentator on India. He covered war, famine, riots and assassinations, the Bhopal gas tragedy and the Indian army's storming of the Sikh Golden Temple. In the small north Indian city of Ayodhya in 1992, he faced a moment of real peril. He witnessed a huge crowd of Hindu hardliners tear down an ancient mosque. Some of the mob - suspicious of the BBC - threatened him, chanting "Death to Mark Tully". He was locked in a room for several hours before a local official and a Hindu priest came to his aid. The demolition provoked the worst religious violence in India for many decades - it was, he said years later, the "gravest setback" to secularism since the country's independence from Britain in 1947. "We are sad to hear the passing of Sir Mark Tully," Jonathan Munro, Interim CEO of BBC News and Current Affairs, said in a statement. "As one of the pioneers of foreign correspondents, Sir Mark opened India to the world through his reporting, bringing the vibrancy and diversity of the country to audiences in the UK and around the world. "His public service commitments and dedication to journalism saw him work as a bureau chief in Delhi, and report for outlets across the BBC. Widely respected in both India and the UK, he was a joy to speak with and will be greatly missed." India was where Sir Mark was born - in what was then Calcutta (now Kolkata) in 1935. He was a child of the British Raj. His father was a businessman. His mother had been born in Bengal - her family had worked in India as traders and administrators for generations. He was brought up with an English nanny who once chided him for learning to count by copying the family's driver: "that's the servants' language, not yours", he was told. He eventually became fluent in Hindi, a rare achievement in Delhi's foreign press corps and one which endeared him to many Indians for whom he was always "Tully sahib". His good cheer and evident affection for India won him the friendship and trust of many of the top rank of the country's politicians, editors and social activists. Throughout his life, he performed a balancing act: English, without doubt; but not - he insisted - an expat who was passing through India. He had roots there; it was his home. It's where he lived for three-quarters of his life. Immediately after World War Two, at the age of nine, Sir Mark came to Britain for his education. He studied history and theology at Cambridge and then headed to theological college with the aim of being ordained as a clergyman before he - and the church - had second thoughts. He was sent to India for the BBC in 1965 - at first as an administrative assistant, but in time he began to take on a reporting role. His broadcasting style was idiosyncratic, but his strength of character and his insight into India shone through. Some critics said he was too indulgent of India's poverty and caste-based inequality; others admired his clearly expressed commitment to the religious tolerance upon which independent India was anchored. It's "really important to treasure the secular culture of this country, allowing every religion to flourish," he told an Indian newspaper in 2016. "... we must not endanger this by insisting on Hindu majoritarianism". Sir Mark was never an armchair correspondent. He travelled relentlessly across India and neighbouring countries, by train when he could. He gave voice to the hopes and fears, trials and tribulations, of ordinary Indians as well as the country's elite. He was as comfortable wearing an Indian kurta as in a shirt and tie. He was expelled from India at 24 hours' notice in 1975 after the then prime minister, Indira Gandhi, ordered a state of emergency. But he headed back 18 months later and had been based in Delhi ever since. He spent more than 20 years as the BBC's head of bureau in Delhi, leading the reporting not simply of India but of South Asia, including the birth of Bangladesh, periods of military rule in Pakistan, the Tamil Tigers' rebellion in Sri Lanka and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Over time, he became increasingly out of step with the BBC's corporate priorities, and in 1993 he made a much-publicised speech accusing the then director general, John Birt, of running the corporation by "fear". It marked a parting of the ways. Sir Mark resigned from the BBC the following year. But he continued to broadcast on BBC airwaves notably as presenter of Radio 4's Something Understood, turning back to issues of faith and spirituality which had engaged him as a student. Unusually for a foreign national, Sir Mark was accorded two of India's top civilian honours: the Padma Shri and the Padma Bhushan. Britain too gave him recognition. He was knighted for services to broadcasting and journalism in the 2002 New Year's honours list. He described the award as "an honour to India". He continued to write books about India - essays, analyses, short stories too, sometimes in collaboration with his partner, Gillian Wright. He lived un-ostentatiously in south Delhi. Sir Mark never gave up his British nationality but was proud also to become late in life an Overseas Citizen of India. That made him, he said, "a citizen of the two countries I feel I belong to, India and Britain".

**Excerpt**

Party backed by generals set for landslide as 'sham' Myanmar election ends Polls in Myanmar have closed after a third and final stage of voting in what are widely viewed as sham elections. Many popular parties are banned from standing and voting has not been possible in large areas of the country because of a five-year-long civil war. The dominant party backed by the ruling military junta is expected to win a landslide victory. The current regime has rejected international criticism of the election, maintaining that it is free and fair. Around one-fifth of the country's 330 townships, including the cities of Yangon and Mandalay, voted in the last stage. Six parties, including the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), fielded candidates nationwide, while another 51 parties and independent candidates decided to contest state and regional levels. Two previous rounds were held on 28 December and 11 January - giving overwhelming victories to the USDP. The party won only 6% of parliamentary seats in the last free election in 2020. As in previous rounds of this strange, month-long election, voting was orderly and peaceful at the polling station in Nyaungshwe, Shan State, which a BBC team observed. Set in a large school, shaded by huge rain trees, there were ample volunteers an officials to guide voters where to go, and how to make their choice using the new, locally-made electronic voting machines. You could be forgiven for believing this was a normal democratic exercise, not the sham its critics say it is. However polling day was preceded by a campaigning period marked by fear, intimidation and a pervasive sense that little will change after the inevitable victory by the USDP. Everywhere the BBC team travelled in southern Shan State, we were followed and closely monitored by dozens of police and military officials, always polite but very persistent. It proved nearly impossible to get people to say anything about the vote, so nervous were they of possible repercussions. The next steps after final results are announced are laid down in the military-drafted constitution. Parliament will meet within the next two months to choose a new president, and everyone expects that to be the coup leader Gen Min Aung Hlaing. It will be the same regime with civilian clothes. But he will then have to relinquish his command of the armed forces. His replacement is certain to be a loyalist, but his hold over the ranks of the military will inevitably be less secure, and it is no secret that many other senior officers do not believe he has made a good job of leading the country. With many more voices in politics, there is the possibility of wider debate inside government over which direction Myanmar should now take, and the possibility - distant for now - of the first steps towards ending the civil war. The military junta took control of Myanmar in a 2021 coup, ousting an elected civilian government led by Nobel Peace Prize Winner Aung San Suu Kyi. She remains in detention and, like many other opposition groups, her National League for Democracy has been formally dissolved. The military has been fighting against both armed resistance groups which oppose the coup and ethnic armies that have their own militias. It lost control of large parts of the country in a series of major setbacks, but clawed back territory this year enabled by support from China and Russia. The civil war has killed thousands of people, displaced millions more, destroyed the economy and left a humanitarian vacuum. A devastating earthquake in March and international funding cuts have made the situation far worse.

Published - Australian Jay Vine won the Tour Down Under - despite being knocked off his bike in a crash caused by a kangaroo. Britain's Matthew Brennan took the fifth and final stage of the race in Australia, on a day dominated by drama in the peloton. The kangaroo ran across the road with under 100km of the race to go and launched itself into the peloton, knocking several riders to the ground before tumbling into more who were trying to avoid it. Vine, having been knocked down, used a team-mate's bike to claim the overall winner's ochre jersey by one minute three seconds for UAE Team Emirates-XRG. Visma-Lease A Bike rider Brennan beat New Zealand's Finn Fisher-Black of Red Bull-Bora Hansgrohe to the line for the stage victory after a powerful acceleration on the uphill sprint finish. Brennan's team-mate Menno Huising of the Netherlands was one of the riders forced to abandon the race, having been injured in the kangaroo incident. Tobias Lund Andresen of Decathlon-CMA CGM took third on the 169.8km stage around the Stirling near Adelaide. Switzerland's Mauro Schmid of Jayco-AlUla was second overall and Australia's Harry Sweeney third for EF Education-EasyPost. Lund Andresen took the blue points jersey, with Norway's Martin Urianstad Bugge winning the mint-green king of the mountains jersey for Uno X Mobility. Brennan ranks highly among several young talented British riders competing on the UCI World Tour this year. He won 12 races in his debut elite-level season in 2025. The win caps a good week for British riders at the first World Tour race of the year following Ethan Vernon's sprint victory on Saturday's stage four for NSN - the new team co-owned by World Cup winner Andres Iniesta. That stage had been shortened to account for temperatures of up to 43C. UK road champion Sam Watson won the opening prologue of the race for Ineos Grenadiers. Many of the riders will now take on the one-day Cadel Evans Great Ocean Road Race in Melbourne, with Brennan a strong favourite for victory. Brennan is particularly powerful on rolling one-day courses, and is set to compete in several of the sport's biggest races this year, including the one-day Milan-San Remo in March, as well as the Tour of Flanders and Paris-Roubaix in April.

Trump says UK soldiers in Afghanistan 'among greatest of all warriors' Donald Trump has praised UK soldiers who fought in Afghanistan after his claim that allied forces avoided the front lines prompted criticism from veterans and politicians. Earlier this week Trump angered US allies by downplaying the role of Nato troops in the war and doubted whether the military alliance would be there for the US "if we ever needed them". Trump's words drew condemnation from international allies, while Sir Keir Starmer called them "insulting and frankly appalling". The UK prime minister spoke to Trump on Saturday, after which the US president used his Truth Social platform to praise UK troops as being "among the greatest of all warriors". Trump was criticised for remarks he made during an interview with Fox News on Thursday in which the president said of Nato troops: "We've never needed them. We have never really asked anything of them. "They'll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan... and they did, they stayed a little back, a little off the front lines." That triggered a huge backlash from the families of soldiers who served in Afghanistan, as well as veterans and politicians from across the Westminster and international spectrum who called for Trump to apologise. Prince Harry said the sacrifices of troops needed to be respected as he pointed out Nato's collective security clause had been invoked once - following the 9/11 attacks. In October 2001 the US invaded Afghanistan to oust the Taliban, whom they said were harbouring Osama Bin Laden and other al-Qaeda figures linked to the 9/11 attacks the previous month. Nato nations contributed troops and military equipment to the US-led war. More than 3,500 coalition soldiers died, about two-thirds of them Americans, as of 2021 when the US withdrew from the country. The UK suffered the second-highest number of military deaths in the conflict behind the US, which suffered 2,461 fatalities. On Saturday, Downing Street said the prime minister and US president spoke about the UK's involvement alongside US and Nato forces in the conflict. A spokesperson said: "The prime minister raised the brave and heroic British and American soldiers who fought side by side in Afghanistan, many of whom never returned home. We must never forget their sacrifice". Shortly after the conversation, Trump posted fresh comments on his Truth Social platform - appearing to step back from his critical comments but stopping short of directly apologising for the words he used in Thursday's interview. He wrote: "The great and very brave soldiers of the United Kingdom will always be with the United States of America. "In Afghanistan, 457 died, many were badly injured, and they were among the greatest of all warriors. "It's a bond too strong to ever be broken. The UK military, with tremendous heart and soul, is second to none (except for the USA). We love you all, and always will!" Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said she was pleased Trump had acknowledged the UK's role in fighting alongside the US and Nato allies in Afghanistan. "It should never have been questioned in the first place," she said. On Friday, the Duke of Sussex released a statement in which he praised the contributions of Nato troops who were in Afghanistan. "I served there. I made lifelong friends there. And I lost friends there," the prince said. "In 2001, Nato invoked Article 5 for the first - and only - time in history. It meant that every allied nation was obliged to stand with the United States in Afghanistan, in pursuit of our shared security. Allies answered that call. "Thousands of lives were changed forever. Mothers and fathers buried sons and daughters. Children were left without a parent. Families are left carrying the cost. "Those sacrifices deserve to be spoken about truthfully and with respect, as we all remain united and loyal to the defence of diplomacy and peace." Most of the 457 British troops who died serving in Afghanistan over a period of nearly 20 years were killed in Helmand - the scene of the heaviest fighting. Hundreds more suffered injuries and lost limbs - including Cpl Andy Reid who lost both his legs and his right arm after stepping on an improvised explosive device (IED) in Afghanistan. "Not a day goes by when we're not in some kind of pain, physically or mentally reflecting on that conflict," he told BBC Breakfast on Friday. Reid recalled working with American soldiers, adding: "If they were on the front line and I was stood next to them, clearly we were on the front line as well." Badenoch, Sir Ed Davey and Nigel Farage were among the Westminster leaders to call out the US president for his comments; while outside the UK, ministers from foreign governments also criticised Trump's remarks. Canada's Minister of National Defence David J McGuinty said Canadian "men and women were on the ground from the beginning, not because we had to, but because it was the right thing to do." American political and military figures have also expressed their anger and frustration over Trump's Nato comments. "I think it's insulting to those who were fighting alongside of us," former national security adviser Herbery Raymond McMaster told the BBC. Trump's new comments on Saturday did not mention any of the other Nato allies who sent troops into Afghanistan. Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said her government "was astonished" to hear Trump's first statement and added "our nation paid a cost that is beyond dispute: 53 Italian soldiers killed and more than 700 wounded". She said on X: "For this reason, statements that downplay the contribution of Nato countries in Afghanistan are unacceptable, especially when they come from an allied nation".

Trump threatens Canada with 100% tariffs if it 'makes a deal with China' US President Donald Trump has threatened to slap a 100% tariff on Canadian goods if the country strikes a trade deal with China. "If Canada makes a deal with China, it will immediately be hit with a 100% Tariff against all Canadian goods and products coming into the U.S.A.," Trump said on Truth Social. It is unclear what deal Trump is referring to in his social media post. Last week, Canada's Prime Minister Carney announced a "strategic partnership" with China, and agreed to reduce tariffs. At the time, Trump called the move "a good thing". But tensions between the US and Canada have grown in recent days, after Carney said in a speech in Davos that the US-led world order had been ruptured. Carney also urged other "middle powers" to band together in the face of economic coercion by "greater powers", though he did not mention Trump by name. Trump responded to the remarks in his own speech the next day, saying: "Canada lives because of the United States." The US president also withdrew an invitation for Canada to join his new Board of Peace. On Saturday, Trump said in his social media post that if Carney "thinks he is going to make Canada a 'Drop Off Port' for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken". The BBC has contacted the White House and Carney's office for comment. Canada's US trade minister Dominic LeBlanc said in a statement: "There is no pursuit of a free trade deal with China." "What was achieved was resolution on several important tariff issues." LeBlanc said the government was focused on building a stronger Canadian economy and strengthening trade partnerships "throughout the world". Canada has been seeking to diversify trade away from the US, its largest trade partner, following the uncertainty caused by Trump's on-again-off-again tariffs. Under the agreement reached between Carney and Chinese President Xi Jinping last week, China will lower levies on Canadian canola oil from 85% to 15% by March, while Canada will tax Chinese EVs at the most-favoured-nation rate, 6.1% – down from 100%. The deal was seen as a breakthrough after years of strained ties and tit-for-tat tariffs, and could see more Chinese investments in Canada. Carney said the progress made with China sets Canada up "well for the new world order".

What we know about fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by federal agents in Minneapolis Federal agents shot and killed a man in Minneapolis on Saturday, the second person to be fatally shot in the city during the Trump administration's immigration enforcement crackdown this month. Local officials identified the man as 37-year-old Alex Pretti, a US citizen who lived in Minneapolis and worked as a nurse. Videos have emerged showing a scuffle between Border Patrol agents and the man in the lead up to the shooting. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said the agents fired in self-defence after Pretti, who they say had a handgun, resisted their attempts to disarm him. Eyewitnesses, local officials and the victim's family have challenged that account, pointing out he had a phone in his hand, not a weapon. His parents accused the administration of spreading "sickening lies" about what happened. "Please get the truth out about our son," they added. The incident, which came two weeks after the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good by an immigration agent, has led to further protests and renewed calls from local leaders for federal agents to leave the city. Here is what we know so far. What happened in the moments before the shooting? The shooting occurred on Saturday morning near Nicollet Avenue and 26th Street in south Minneapolis at 9:05 local time (15:05 GMT). Greg Bovino, the Border Patrol commander, said agents had been carrying out a "targeted" immigration enforcement operation when Pretti approached agents with a "9mm semi-automatic" handgun. Bovino did not specify if Pretti was brandishing the gun, but said agents attempted to disarm him and he "violently resisted". The commander said a Border Patrol officer then "fired defensive shots". Videos from the moments before the shooting show Pretti filming agents with his phone in the middle of the street. Whistling and shouting can be heard from bystanders in the background. From one angle, an agent appears to push a woman. When the camera pans back to Pretti, he is seen with his arm around her. The agent then pushes back a second woman. At the same time, Pretti reaches his arm out and stands between her and the agent. The agent then sprays a substance in his eyes. Pretti turns his face away and reaches one open hand up in the air. He appears to be clutching a phone in the other. No gun is visible. Another video from a different angle shows the agent grabbing Pretti by the arm, before more agents get involved. Pretti is brought to the ground, with at least six agents on top of him. One agent can be seen striking at his head. Another officer, who appears to approach the scuffle with empty hands, pulls back with what appears to be a gun in his hand. As he moves away toward a vehicle, a split second later another agent standing beside him opens fire. The agents jump back from the man lying on the ground and the firing continues. A total of 10 gunshots are heard. What do we know about the gun? After the shooting, DHS shared a photo of a firearm on social media, which they said belonged to Pretti. The agency also said he had two magazines of ammunition and no ID. Bovino told reporters it looked like a "situation where an individual wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement". He did not provide any further evidence. Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said at a news conference that Pretti was believed to be a lawful gun owner with a permit to carry. His only previous interactions with law enforcement, as far as police are aware, were related to parking tickets. In a sign of the tensions between federal and local authorities, the police chief also said the DHS had not provided his team with "any specific details" about the deadly incident itself. Later, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was asked to clarify if Pretti had brandished a gun. She said: "Individuals showed up to impede a law enforcement operation and assaulted our officers. "They responded according to their training, and took action to defend the officer's life and those of the public around him. And, I don't know of any peaceful protester that shows up with a gun and ammunition rather than a sign." Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, a Democrat, said he understood the risk of people trying to bear witness and document the actions of federal agents. "Thank God, thank God, we have video because, according to DHS, these seven heroic guys took an onslaught of a battalion against them or something. It's nonsense, people. It is nonsense, and it's lies." Pretti's parents ask for the 'truth' to be told Alex Pretti's parents Michael and Susan have called for "the truth" to be told about their son, after he was shot dead in the confrontation with federal immigration officers. "We are heartbroken but also very angry," they said in a family statement, according to several US outlets. "The sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting." They added that videos showed Pretti was not holding a gun when he was tackled by federal agents. Instead, they said, he was holding his phone with one hand and using the other to shield a woman who was being pepper-sprayed. "Alex was a kindhearted soul who cared deeply for his family and friends and also the American veterans whom he cared for as an ICU nurse at the Minneapolis VA hospital. "Alex wanted to make a difference in this world. Unfortunately he will not be with us to see his impact. "Please get the truth out about our son. He was a good man."
