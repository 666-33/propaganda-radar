'They just kept killing': Eyewitnesses describe deadly crackdown in Iran "I saw it with my own eyes - they fired directly into lines of protesters, and people fell where they stood." Omid's voice was shaking as he spoke, fearful of being traced. Breaking the wall of silence between Iran and the rest of the world takes immense courage, given the risk of reprisals by the authorities. Omid, in his early 40s and whose name we have changed for his safety, has been protesting on the streets of a small city in southern Iran over the past few days against worsening economic hardship. He said security forces had opened fire at unarmed protesters in his city with Kalashnikov-style assault rifles. "We are fighting a brutal regime with empty hands," he said. The BBC has received similar accounts of the crackdown by security forces following the widespread protests across the country last week. Since then, internet access has been cut by the authorities, making reporting from Iran more difficult than ever. BBC Persian is banned from reporting inside Iran by the government. One of the largest nationwide anti-government protests took place on Thursday, the twelfth night of demonstrations. Many people appear to have joined the protests on Thursday and Friday after calls from Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the last shah of Iran who was overthrown in the 1979 Islamic revolution. The following day, Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei said: "The Islamic Republic will not back down." It appears that the worst bloodshed occurred after that warning as security forces and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps take their orders from him. Iranian authorities accused the US and Israel of fomenting trouble and condemned "terrorist actions", state media reported. A young woman from Tehran said last Thursday felt like "the day of judgement". "Even remote neighbourhoods of Tehran were packed with protesters - places you wouldn't believe," she said. "But on Friday, security forces only killed and killed and killed. Seeing it with my own eyes made me so unwell that I completely lost morale. Friday was a bloody day." She said that, after Friday's killings, people were afraid to go out and that many were now chanting from alleys and inside their homes. Tehran was a battlefield, she said, with protesters and security forces taking positions and cover on the streets. But she added: "In war, both sides have weapons. Here, people only chant and get killed. It is a one-sided war." Eyewitnesses in Fardis, a city just to the west of Tehran, said that on Friday, members of the paramilitary Basij force under the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) suddenly attacked protesters after hours without a police presence on the streets. The forces, who were in uniform and riding motorcycles, fired live ammunition directly at protesters, according to the witnesses. Unmarked cars were also driven into alleys, with occupants shooting at residents who were not involved in the protests, they said. "Two or three people were killed in every alley," one witness alleged. Those who have given accounts to BBC Persian say the reality inside Iran is hard for the outside world to imagine, and the death toll reported by international media so far only represents a fraction of their own estimates. International news outlets are not allowed to work freely inside Iran and they are mostly relying on Iranian human rights groups who are active outside the country. On Monday the Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHRNGO) said at least 648 protesters in Iran had been killed, including nine people under the age of 18. Some local sources and eyewitnesses report very high numbers of people killed across different cities, ranging from several hundreds to thousands. The BBC is currently unable to independently verify these figures and, so far, Iranian authorities have not provided official or transparent statistics on the number of deaths of protesters. However, Iranian media has reported that 100 security personnel had been killed during the protests, saying that protesters - whom they refer to as "rioters" - set fire to dozens of mosques and banks in various cities. Videos verified by BBC Persian's fact-checking team also show police vehicles and some government buildings being set alight in different locations during the protests. Testimonies and video sent to BBC Persian are mainly from larger cities such as Tehran, nearby Karaj, Rasht in the north, Mashhad in the north-east, and Shiraz in the south. These areas have greater access to the internet via the Starlink satellite network. Information from small towns - where many early casualties occurred - is scarce as their access to Starlink is very limited. But the volume, consistency, and similarity of the accounts received from various cities point to the severity of the crackdown and the widespread use of lethal violence. Nurses and medics who spoke to the BBC said they had seen numerous dead bodies and injured protesters. They reported that hospitals in many cities had been overwhelmed and were unable to treat those with severe injuries, especially to the head and eyes. Some witnesses reported bodies "stacked on top of each other" and not handed over to families. Graphic videos published on the activist-run Telegram channel Vahid Online on Sunday showed a large number of bodies at the Kahrizak Forensic Medical Centre in Tehran, with many families either mourning or attempting to identify the corpses. In one of the videos apparently from Kahrizak, relatives are seen looking at the photos of unidentified bodies displayed on a screen. Many bodies in black bags were visible in the facility and on the street outside, only some of which seem to have been identified. One video showed the inside of a warehouse containing several bodies, while another showed a truck being unloaded with people removing corpses from it. A mortuary worker in a cemetery in Mashhad said that before sunrise on Friday morning between 180 and 200 bodies with severe head injuries were brought in and buried immediately. A source in Rasht told BBC Persian that 70 bodies of protesters were transferred to a hospital mortuary in the city on Thursday. According to the source, security forces demanded "payment for bullets" before releasing bodies to families. At the same time, a medical staff member at a hospital in eastern Tehran told BBC Persian that on Thursday, around 40 bodies were brought there the same day. The hospital's name has been withheld to protect the identity of the medic. UN Secretary-General António Guterres said on Sunday that he was "shocked by reports of violence and excessive use of force by the Iranian authorities against protesters resulting in deaths and injuries in recent days". "I want to emphasise that regardless of the death toll, the use of lethal force by security forces is concerning," Mai Sato, the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran, told BBC Persian.

Trump to meet Venezuelan opposition leader Machado at the White House Venezuelan opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner María Corina Machado will meet President Donald Trump on Thursday, the White House has confirmed. The visit comes just weeks after Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro was seized in Caracas by US forces. But Trump declined to endorse Machado, whose movement claimed victory in 2024's widely contested elections, as its new leader. The US instead backed Delcy Rodríguez, Maduro's former vice-president. Machado said last week she hoped to thank Trump personally for the action against Maduro and would like to give the Nobel Prize to him. Trump called it "a great honour", but the Nobel Committee later clarified that it was not transferable. Earlier, Trump had expressed displeasure over Machado's decision to accept the Nobel Peace Prize, an honour the president has long coveted. Asked on Friday whether receiving Machado's prize might change his view of her role in Venezuela, the president said: "She might be involved in some aspect of it." "I will have to speak to her. I think it's very nice that she wants to come in. And that's what I understand the reason is," he said. Earlier this month, after Maduro's ouster, Trump had said Machado "doesn't have the support within, or the respect within, the country". "She's a very nice woman, but she doesn't have the respect," he said. The US has so far backed Delcy Rodríguez as Venezuela's interim president. Trump describes Rodríguez as an "ally", and she has not been charged by US officials with any crimes. "Delcy Rodríguez and her team have been very cooperative with the United States," White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Monday. But Machado has maintained that her coalition should "absolutely" be in charge of the country. Machado has said nobody trusted Rodríguez, telling CBS that the interim leader was "one of the main architects... of repression for innocent people" in the South American country. "Everybody in Venezuela and abroad knows perfectly who she is and the role she has played," Machado said. The former legislator, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last year, described US military action in Venezuela as "a major step towards restoring prosperity and rule of law and democracy in Venezuela". Rodríguez has rebuffed claims by Trump that the US was in charge of Venezuela. "The Venezuelan government rules our country, and no-one else does," she said in a televised speech. "There is no external agent governing Venezuela."

### 3. [Former Fed chairs condemn criminal investigation into Jerome Powell](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c394xwdve9lo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

Former Fed chairs condemn criminal investigation into Jerome Powell Three former heads of the US central bank on Monday strongly criticised a criminal investigation into chair Jerome Powell, describing it as a bid to undermine the Federal Reserve's independence. In a statement, Janet Yellen, Ben Bernanke and Alan Greenspan, along with 10 other eminent former officials, rallied behind Powell. "This is how monetary policy is made in emerging markets with weak institutions, with highly negative consequences for inflation and the functioning of their economies more broadly," the former officials wrote. "It has no place in the United States whose greatest strength is the rule of law, which is at the foundation of our economic success," they added. The move by the Department of Justice (DoJ) comes after a year of relentless attacks on Powell by US President Donald Trump. As well as criticising Powell's decisions on interest rates, Trump has launched personal attacks, calling the Fed chair a "major loser" and "numbskull". The president said he did not "know anything" about the investigation. The Justice Department has been contacted for comment. The DoJ probe was first disclosed by Powell in an unscheduled video statement on Sunday. He said the Justice Department had threatened a criminal indictment over testimony he gave to a Senate committee last year about renovations to Federal Reserve buildings. Powell called the investigation "unprecedented" and said he believed it stemmed from Trump's anger that the Fed had not brought interest rates down more quickly. "This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings," Powell said. "Those are pretexts." The central bank lowered the target for its key lending rate three times in the second half of 2025, putting it in a range of 3.50% to 3.75% - its lowest level in three years. But Trump has repeatedly said that the central bank has not cut interest rates as sharply as he would like. The DoJ probe "should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure", Powell said in his statement. Monday's public condemnation of the DoJ move has been signed by former federal government officials appointed by both Democratic and Republican presidents. When asked by Fox News on Monday about the Fed's independence, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt deferred to the Justice Department. "Jerome Powell has proved he's no good at his job," Leavitt said. "As to whether he's a criminal, that's an answer the Department of Justice is going to have to find." Trump has publicly urged Powell to cut interest rates in order to reduce the US government's hefty borrowing costs and to make it easier for Americans to get mortgages and other loans. Last year, he spent months attacking Powell on social media and in remarks to reporters. He floated the possibility of firing Powell, only to quickly abandon the idea, which analysts say would rock financial markets and spark a legal battle. Yellen, who served as Fed chair for a year during Trump's first term before she was replaced by Powell, said in separate comments that the probe was "extremely chilling". "Knowing Powell as well as I do, the odds that he would have lied are zero so I do believe they're going after him because they want his seat and want him gone," Yellen told CNBC. She suggested investors should be concerned about the development. "You have a president that says the Fed should be cutting rates to lower rate payments on the federal debt… It is the road to banana republic." Trump is expected to name someone in the coming weeks to replace Powell, whose term as Fed chairman will end in May. But the Justice Department investigation and subsequent backlash could disrupt the confirmation process. North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis, a Republican who is a member of the Senate Banking Committee, said he would oppose the nomination of Powell's replacement by Trump, and any other Fed Board nominee, until the matter was "fully resolved". Initial reaction in US stock markets was muted on Monday. The S&P 500 was roughly flat in early afternoon trading - a notable contrast to last year, when markets were jolted by perceived threats to the Fed's independence. Global markets also proved "remarkably resilient" on Monday, said Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell. She noted that despite the overall calm, financial stocks did slump, as investors weighed the effects of a possible 10% cap on credit card interest rates. Still, analysts said the market reaction could grow if Trump succeeded in influencing Fed policy. Some Republican lawmakers also raised concerns about how the Justice Department probe might affect the Fed's work. Representative French Hill, the Republican chair of the House Financial Services Committee, said in a statement that the investigation was causing an "unnecessary distraction" and it could "undermine this and future administrations' ability to make sound monetary policy decisions". Senator Kevin Cramer, a Republican member of the Senate Banking Committee, criticised Powell in a statement but added: "I do not believe however, he is a criminal. I hope this criminal investigation can be put to rest."

'Miracle baby' born in a tree above Mozambique floodwaters dies aged 25 She was seen as a "miracle baby" after being born in a tree which her mother had climbed to escape flooding, but nearly 26 years on Mozambican Rosita Salvador Mabuiango has died after a long illness, her sister told the BBC. The sight of the newborn and her mother being winched to safety by helicopter amid the deluged landscape became one of the defining images of the Mozambique floods of 2000 – the country's worst ever. Reflecting on Rosita's life, President Daniel Chapo described her as a symbol for girls in the country. In February 2000, hundreds died and hundreds of thousands of others were forced from their homes after the Limpopo river burst its banks in southern Mozambique. Rosita's mother, Carolina Cecilia Chirindza, was one of those caught up in the crisis. "It was a Sunday afternoon about four o'clock, and the waters began rising," the Red Cross quoted her as saying later in 2000. "The water was coming right up to the house, and was getting stronger and stronger, so like everyone else in the village, we headed for the trees. "I put my two small children on my back and tried to climb up. It was very difficult. "There were 15 of us all together, and we were there for four days. We prayed and prayed. "We had nothing to eat, and the children cried and cried, but we could do nothing for them." In the early hours of Wednesday morning, Carolina went into labour and shortly afterwards she and the newborn were spotted by a South African military helicopter that was helping in the rescue operations. The two became symbols of the aftermath of the disaster, and they travelled to the US later in 2000 to speak to Congress and help raise awareness about what had happened. On Monday, confirming the news of Rosita's death at 25, her sister Celia Salvador told the BBC that she had "passed away after a prolonged illness. I'm extremely sad. She died of an illness I am unable to explain what it was." According to other family sources, Rosita had been battling against the blood disorder anaemia for years. As a result of the worsening of her condition, she had been in hospital for more than two weeks, where she eventually died on Monday morning. "My God. Very bad news. My condolences to the bereaved family," the president told the BBC. "She was a symbol for girls in Mozambique. That's why, I extend my condolences to all the Mozambican people, especially to Mozambican girls." Rosita grew up with her family and graduated from high school in the same rural area – Chibuto – where she was born. She herself had a daughter five years ago. Political analyst Charles Mangwiro described her death as a "wake-up call for the government to improve service delivery in the entire health system in the country. "You cannot expect to survive when health professionals complain every day about unpaid salaries for months and about the shortage of essentials like protective materials and antibiotics." Despite recruiting more health workers in recent years, analysts continue to describe an overstretched health system short of basic drugs and equipment. Chibuto Mayor Henriques Machava told the press that conversations were under way with the family to formalise the funeral arrangements, which, according to him, would be taken care of by the municipality.

Jailed Venezuelan politician's son says Trump shouldn't be 'fooled' by pledge of prisoner releases The son of a jailed Venezuelan opposition leader has warned Donald Trump to "not be fooled" by the country's government, amid accusations it has not kept its promise to release a significant number of political prisoners. Ramón Guanipa, the son of Juan Pablo Guanipa, said he believed the US president was unaware that only about 40 releases out of more than 800 political prisoners had reportedly been confirmed so far. On Saturday, Trump thanked the Venezuelan authorities, saying they had "started the process, in a BIG WAY". The Venezuelan government announced on Thursday it would release detainees considered political prisoners by human rights groups as a "goodwill gesture". The move came after the US seized Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro in a raid on the capital, Caracas, on 3 January, and took him to New York, where he has been charged with drug trafficking. Jorge Rodríguez, Venezuela's National Assembly leader and the brother of Interim President Delcy Rodríguez, announced that an "important number of Venezuelan and foreign detainees" would be released "immediately". On Monday, the government said more than 100 such prisoners had already been released - a number far greater than the figure so far confirmed by human rights campaigners. Among those who are confirmed to have been released are several high-profile opposition figures - with Spain's foreign ministry confirming that five Spanish citizens had been freed, including human rights lawyer Rocío San Miguel. Trump claimed credit for the releases, writing on social media on Saturday: "I hope these prisoners will remember how lucky they got that the USA came along and did what had to be done." But relatives of those still behind bars have been expressing their frustration that only a small number of prisoners have been freed. Ramón Guanipa, whose father is a close ally of opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize laureate María Corina Machado, told BBC Mundo: "I want to tell President Trump that he must not be fooled and [should] keep pressure on these guys." He added: "I want to thank President Trump for the pressure that he's been enforcing. He's been our greatest ally in this situation." However, pointing to the small number of people released so far, Guanipa warned Trump that "if he thinks this is going alright, it is not". Ramón Guanipa says he has only been allowed to visit his father once since the older man was arrested. Juan Pablo Guanipa went into hiding after being accused of terrorism and treason for challenging the result of the 2024 presidential election. That vote was lacked "basic transparency and integrity", according to the UN, and was denounced as rigged by the US which did not recognise Maduro as Venezuela's legitimate leader. For his comments, Juan Pablo Guanipa was tracked down by Venezuelan security forces and detained in May 2025. After hearing about the planned prisoner release, Ramón Guanipa took the first available flight from Maracaibo, in the west of the country, to Caracas. "When they tell you they're going to release your family, everything else becomes small," he explained. But when his father was not among those freed, he felt "defeated". "But at the same time, you find another reason to fight. I'm fighting for them [the interim government] to actually do what they say they're going to do." The Venezuelan government has not commented on the pace of the releases, and the attorney general has declined a BBC interview request. The developments are being viewed as the first test of Trump's influence in Venezuela following the removal of Maduro. Interim President Delcy Rodríguez has appeared to welcome co-operation with the Trump administration, but her public statements have condemned any form of US intervention. The government's announcement about prisoner releases came a day after Trump said that the Venezuelan authorities would shut down El Helicoide, the country's most notorious prison. El Helicoide was originally designed to be a shopping centre and a symbol of Venezuela's oil-fuelled prosperity, but became a fortress of political repression under Maduro. Outside El Helicoide in western Caracas, the atmosphere is tense, with relatives keeping vigil. Carmen Farfán's son, José Gregorio Reyes, was detained along with his wife and a friend, while he was in hospital in western Venezuela. Their families have heard nothing since. Farfán does not know where her son is being held but has come to El Helicoide to join others in pleading for their relatives' release - wherever they may be. Beside her, Reyes' sister-in-law, cries as she describes how the three were arrested in November 2025. "We hope they tell us where they are keeping them. We are desperate. We've been waiting for many days without any answers," Farfán says. Venezuela's opposition and human rights groups have long accused the government of using detentions to stamp out dissent and silence critics, but officials repeatedly denied Venezuela held any political prisoners, arguing those detained were arrested for criminal activity. Opposition activists have described the release of political prisoners as an "urgent" step towards any transition of power. However, the small number freed so far has raised doubts about the interim government's intentions and questions over the extent of its willingness to cooperate with the US.

**Excerpt**

Meta blocks 550,000 accounts under Australia's social media ban About 550,000 accounts were blocked by Meta during the first days of Australia's landmark social media ban for kids. In December, a new law began requiring that the world's most popular social media sites - including Instagram and Facebook - stop Australians aged under 16 from having accounts on their platforms. The ban, which is being watched closely around the world, was justified by campaigners and the government as necessary to protect children from harmful content and algorithms. Companies including Meta have said they agree more is needed to keep young people safe online. However they continue to argue for other measures, with some experts raising similar concerns. "We call on the Australian government to engage with industry constructively to find a better way forward, such as incentivising all of industry to raise the standard in providing safe, privacy-preserving, age appropriate experiences online, instead of blanket bans," Meta said in a blog update. The company said it blocked 330,639 accounts on Instagram, 173,497 on Facebook, and 39,916 on Threads during it's first week of compliance with the new law. They again put the argument that age verification should happen at an app store level - something they suggested lowers the burden of compliance on both regulators and the apps themselves - and that exemptions for parental approval should be created. "This is the only way to guarantee consistent, industry-wide protections for young people, no matter which apps they use, and to avoid the whack-a-mole effect of catching up with new apps that teens will migrate to in order to circumvent the social media ban law." Various governments, from the US state of Florida to the European Union, have been experimenting with limiting children's use of social media. But, along with a higher age limit of 16, Australia is the first jurisdiction to deny an exemption for parental approval in a policy like this - making its laws the world's strictest. The policy is wildly popular with parents and envied by world leader, with the Tories this week pledging to follow suit if they win power at the next election, due before 2029. However some experts have raised concerns that Australian kids can circumvent the ban with relative ease - either by tricking the technology that's performing the age checks, or by finding other, potentially less safe, places on the net to gather. And backed by some mental health advocates, many children have argued it robs young people of connection - particularly those from LGBTQ+, neurodivergent or rural communities - and will leave them less equipped to tackle the realities of life on the web.
