Trump mulls 'very strong' military options as hundreds killed in Iran protests President Donald Trump says the US military is considering "very strong options" in Iran, as anti-government protests which have reportedly killed hundreds enter a third week. The US-based Human Rights Activist News Agency (HRANA) says it has verified the deaths of nearly 500 protesters and 48 security personnel in Iran, while sources tell the BBC the death toll could be much higher. Trump has threatened to intervene, and said on Sunday that Iranian officials had called him "to negotiate" - but added "we may have to act before a meeting". Iranian leaders have described the demonstrators as a "bunch of vandals", and called on their supporters to take part in pro-government marches on Monday. The government has also announced three days of mourning for what it called "martyrs" killed in a "national battle against the US and Israel" - two countries that Tehran says are fomenting unrest. Anger over the plummeting value of the Iranian currency sparked protests in late December, which have grown into a crisis of legitimacy for Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Trump has not yet elaborated on what the US is considering in terms of military options, nor on the proposed negotiations, despite saying that a "meeting is being set up" with Iranian officials. He added that Iranian leaders "want to negotiate", because "they are tired of being beat up by the United States". A US official told the BBC's US news partner CBS that Trump has been briefed on options for military strikes on Iran. Other approaches could include boosting anti-government sources online, using cyber-weapons against Iran's military, or imposing more sanctions, officials told the Wall Street Journal. Sources told the BBC that protests continued on Sunday night, but at a reduced level compared to previous days, as fears grow of an escalating crackdown by the Iranian government. At least 10,600 people have been detained over the fortnight of unrest, according to HRANA. The BBC counted 180 body bags in footage from a morgue near the Iranian capital, with one source saying on Sunday that the streets of Tehran were "full of blood". "They're taking away bodies in trucks," the source added. In one video from the site near Tehran, about 180 shrouded or wrapped figures can be seen, the majority lying out in the open. Shouts and cries of distress can be heard from people who appear to be looking for their loved ones. Footage has been blurred to protect the identities of the living, who could face further persecution from the authorities. Sources said large numbers of bodies had accumulated at hospitals and forensic facilities, while some bodies were reportedly buried urgently before dawn by the authorities, limiting the chance for identification. City workers have also removed debris, burned cars and bloodstains from the streets during the night, a source told the BBC. Multiple sources in Iran also said that they had seen drones flying persistently over crowds and residential neighbourhoods to identify and track protesters. The BBC and most other international news organisations are unable to report from inside Iran, and the Iranian government has imposed an internet shutdown since Thursday, making obtaining and verifying information difficult. Some witnesses are relying on Starlink proxy connections or satellite television for information, but fear that these could be used by the authorities to trace them. "We cannot even send text messages," one source in southern Iran told the BBC, as a blanket internet outage continued. "Only the government is sending threatening messages to people." Trump said on Sunday that he would speak to Elon Musk, owner of company SpaceX which operates Starlink, about restoring internet access to Iran. "He's very good at that kind of thing, he's got a very good company," Trump said. The protests are the largest in Iran since an uprising in 2022, triggered by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish woman who was detained by morality police for allegedly not wearing her hijab properly. Khamenei has said demonstrators were seeking to "please" Trump, while Iran's attorney general said anyone protesting would be considered an "enemy of God" - an offence that carries the death penalty. Iran's parliament speaker warned the US should not make a "miscalculation", adding that if the US attacked Iran, both Israeli and US military and shipping centres in the region would become legitimate targets. Meanwhile, Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran's last shah, said in a post on X that the protests had "shaken the foundations" of the Iranian government". He added: "The increase in gunfire against the people is not a sign of strength, but of fear - fear of collapse and an accelerated downfall."

### 2. [US justice department opens criminal probe into Fed chair Jerome Powell](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c801k7rkkd7o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

US justice department opens criminal probe into Fed chair Jerome Powell Federal prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation into Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, he said on Sunday. In a video announcing the probe, Powell said the US justice department served the agency with subpoenas and threatened a criminal indictment over testimony he gave to a Senate committee about renovations to Federal Reserve buildings. He called the probe "unprecedented" and said he believed it was opened due to him drawing Donald Trump's ire over refusing to lower interest rates despite repeated public pressure from the president. The Fed chair is the latest to come at odds with Trump and then face criminal investigation by the US justice department. The BBC has contacted the justice department and the White House for comment. "This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions, or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation," Powell said. "I have deep respect for the rule of law and for accountability in our democracy. No one, certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve is above the law, but this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure," he went on to say. Trump said in an interview with NBC News on Sunday that he did not have any knowledge of the Justice Department's investigation into the Fed. "I don't know anything about it, but he's certainly not very good at the Fed, and he's not very good at building buildings," he said of Powell. The probe, which prosecutors have not confirmed, would signal a fresh escalation in Trump's ongoing dispute with Powell, who the president nominated for the role as Fed chair in 2017. Trump has repeatedly threatened to remove Powell, who he has criticised for not cutting interest rates as quickly as the president would have liked. In the second half of 2025, the Fed cut interest rates three times. The president has consistently blamed his predecessor, Joe Biden, and interest rates for inflation and costs in the US. Critics have raised concerns that Trump's pressure to oust the Fed chair would muddy the institution's authority to set interest rates independently from presidents. North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis, a Republican who is a member of the Senate Banking Committee, said he would oppose the nomination of Powell's replacement by Trump, and any other Fed Board nominee, "until this legal matter is fully resolved". "If there were any remaining doubt whether advisers within the Trump Administration are actively pushing to end the independence of the Federal Reserve, there should now be none," Tillis said in a statement. "It is now the independence and credibility of the Department of Justice that are in question," the senator said. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat, said she believed Trump's plan was to push Powell off the Fed board for good and "install another sock puppet to complete his corrupt takeover of America's central bank". "This committee and the Senate should not move forward with any Trump nominee for the Fed, including Fed Chair," she said. Powell's investigation will be overseen by the US Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia, according to the New York Times, which first reported the probe. April Larusse, head of investment specialists at Insight Investment, told the BBC's Today programme that "it really isn't the case that the Federal Reserve has been doing nothing on interest rates so this does feel like perhaps it is pressure that isn't really justified". She added that Trump wants lower rates as "he is definitely trying to make sure that all parts of the economy benefit". "For people at the lower end of the income spectrum things have been difficult – inflation was very high, wages were not keeping up with inflation - and so there is a big part of the US population that frankly is still suffering with a cost of living crisis." The criminal probe into Powell, together with news of continued unrest in Iran, sparked a jump in the price of precious metals. The price of gold - which is often seen a safer asset in times of uncertainty - was up 1.4% at $4,572.36 per ounce on Monday, having hit a record high of $4,600.33 earlier. Silver also hit a record high - of $84.58 an ounce - before slipping back to $83.26 per ounce, a rise of 5.4% for the day. Trump previously took aim at Lisa Cook, a governor at the US central bank, whom he tried to fire over alleged mortgage fraud. The case was blocked by a US federal court and will be heard by the Supreme Court later this month. Criminal charges brought by Trump's justice department against political adversaries like New York Attorney General Letitia James, who brought a civil fraud case against Trump in 2024, and ex-Federal Bureau of Investigation boss James Comey were also dismissed by a court. Comey was accused of making false statements and obstructing justice. He was fired by Trump during his first term after leading a probe into Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election, which Trump won over Hillary Clinton. Both Comey and James have maintained their innocence and said the prosecutions were politically charged.

### 3. [More federal agents to be sent to Minnesota, Trump administration says](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpv7knz8e8mo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

More federal agents to be sent to Minnesota, Trump administration says The Trump administration has said it will send "hundreds more" federal officers to Minneapolis, days after the death of a woman who was shot by a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent in the city. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem told Fox News that "hundreds more" will be sent to the area "in order to allow our ICE and our Border Patrol individuals that are working in Minneapolis to do so safely". Protests against immigration enforcement have been held in cities across the US after 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good was shot in her car on Wednesday. The Trump administration says the agent acted in self-defence. Local officials insist the woman posed no danger. Noem said the officers will arrive "today and tomorrow" and warned action would be taken if people tried to obstruct their work. "If they conduct violent activities against law enforcement, if they impede our operations, that's a crime, and we will hold them accountable to those consequences," she said. Protesters gathered in Minneapolis on Saturday, with anti-ICE protests also taking place elsewhere in the US, including in Austin, Seattle, New York and Los Angeles. Minneapolis police estimated "tens of thousands of people" attended the "ICE out of Minnesota" rally and march, which started in Powderhorn Park on Saturday. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said the protest was "peaceful". Police said 31 people had been arrested after protests on Friday and Saturday. Minnesota has already seen a surge of federal law enforcement officials as the Trump administration ramps up immigration enforcement in the state. Speaking to CNN, Noem also doubled down on her assessment that Good was committing an act of "domestic terrorism", saying she had "weaponised" her car" to attack ICE agents. In response to her comments, Frey told CNN: "Anybody can see that this victim is not a domestic terrorist", and he said her actions were of someone trying to do a three-point turn to escape the scene. The Minneapolis mayor added that the city's local law enforcement were "outnumbered by the number of ICE agents and beyond". On Sunday, Minnesota senator Tina Smith, a Democrat, accused the Trump administration of trying to cover up the shooting. "I think what we are seeing here is the federal government, Kristi Noem, Vice President Vance, Donald Trump, attempting to cover up what happened here," Smith told ABC News. "I don't think that people here and around the country are believing it," she added. In a statement, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson accused Smith of lying, saying: "Tina's lies only serve to further inflame tensions and incite violence against law enforcement officers." Videos of the incident show ICE agents approaching a car which is in the middle of the street, and telling the woman behind the wheel to get out of the SUV. One of the agents tugs at the driver's side door handle. As the vehicle attempts to drive off, one of the agents at the front of the car points their gun at the driver and several shots are heard. The car then continues to drive away from the officer and crashes into the side of the street. Good's wife told local media the pair had gone to the scene of immigration enforcement activity to support neighbours. The officer who fired on Good is Jonathan Ross, a veteran ICE agent who was previously injured in the line of duty when he was struck by a car. The FBI has said it will investigate the shooting. On Friday, Minnesota officials said they would open their own inquiry after saying they had been frozen out of the federal investigation. Previously, US Vice-President JD Vance said the investigation is a federal issue.

**Excerpt**

Chalamet beats DiCaprio to Golden Globes glory Timothée Chalamet was among the main winners as Hollywood's finest gathered for this year's Golden Globe Awards. Chalamet, 30, continued his pursuit of greatness, and an Oscar, by beating stars including Leonardo DiCaprio and George Clooney to the award for best actor in a musical or comedy for table tennis caper Marty Supreme. Despite DiCaprio missing out, his film One Battle After Another won the most awards overall, with four prizes including best musical or comedy film and best director. Irish actress Jessie Buckley was named best drama actress for Hamnet, which also scored a surprise win in the best drama film category. Vampire thriller Sinners had been considered the frontrunner, but it instead went home with the box office achievement prize as well as best score. The Golden Globes are a key stop on the road to the Academy Awards, and other acting winners on Sunday included Teyana Taylor, Rose Byrne, Wagner Moura and Stellan Skarsgård. Unlike the Oscars, the Globes also reward TV shows, and the night saw British actors Stephen Graham, Owen Cooper and Erin Doherty pick up more honours for their performances in Netflix drama Adolescence. Chalamet's 'sweet' win With all eyes on the Oscars race, Timothée Chalamet's victory has given him a boost over his rivals. "I'm in a category with many greats," he said when accepting his trophy. It was Chalamet's fifth Globes nomination, but his first win. "My dad instilled in me a spirit of gratitude growing up, always be grateful for what you have," he said. "It's allowed me to leave this ceremony in the past empty handed, my head held high, grateful just to be here. But I'd be lying if I didn't say those moments make this moment that much sweeter. "For my parents, for my partner, I love you so much," he added, looking at girlfriend Kylie Jenner. Jessie Buckley says win is 'real honour' Jessie Buckley was named best actress for her role in the adaptation of Maggie O'Farrell's best-selling novel Hamnet, about the death of William Shakespeare's son. "This is not a normal feeling or situation to be in," she said in her acceptance speech. "It was such an extraordinary set to be part of, because we were telling the story of probably the most famous Brit that ever lived, and we had a Chinese director, a lot of Irish, a mostly Polish crew, beside our British family." She concluded: "This is a real honour, I love being part of this industry." Shortly afterwards, Hamnet director Chloe Zhao looked visibly shocked when the movie was announced as the winner of best drama film. Accepting the prize, producer Steven Spielberg said he had "loved the book" by O'Farrell, but felt Zhao was "the only film-maker on the face of the planet who could tell the story". Zhao said: "The village of Hamnet that made this film together. Some of them lost their loved ones while we were making this film, and some of them are still struggling, and I just wanted to say we're thinking of you, we're here because of you, we love you." Teyana Taylor's tearful message Elsewhere, singer and actress Teyana Taylor, whose career started when she choreographed a Beyonce music video at the age of 15, cemented her Hollywood breakthrough by winning best supporting film actress for One Battle After Another. After tearfully thanking a list of people, she used her acceptance speech to send a message to "my brown sisters and little brown girls watching tonight". "Our light does not need permission to shine," she told them. "We belong in every room we walk into. Our voices matter and our dreams deserve space." Swedish actor Stellan Skarsgård, 74, won best supporting actor for Sentimental Value, and joked that he hadn't prepared a speech "because I thought that I was too old". He then made an impassioned plea for people to see films like his on the big screen. "Cinema should be seen in cinemas," he said to cheers from the crowd. Australia's Rose Byrne was named best actress in a film musical or comedy for If I Had Legs I'd Kick You, and paid tribute to members of her family. "My brother's my date. Thanks, George," she laughed. "Thanks to my mum and dad, who bought Paramount+ so they could watch the Golden Globes from Sydney. "And I want to thank my husband, Bobby Cannavale. He couldn't be here because, um, we're getting a bearded dragon, and he went to a reptile expo in New Jersey. So thank you, baby." Meanwhile, KPop Demon Hunters won best animated film and best song for Golden. Brazilian political thriller The Secret Agent was named best international film, while its star Wagner Moura won best drama actor. "This is a film about generational trauma," Moura said, "and I think that if trauma can be passed along generations, values can too. So this is to the ones that are sticking with their values in difficult moments." Paul Thomas Anderson won best film director and screenplay for One Battle After Another. "You guys are being so generous with this affection for me and this film," Anderson said, adding: "I love doing what I do." Adolescence star 'still learning' British teenager Owen Cooper continued a year of adulation and awards acclaim for his performance in Adolescence, winning best TV supporting actor. The 16-year-old from Warrington appears to be keeping his feet on the ground, telling the assembled A-listers: "I'm still very much an apprentice. I'm still learning every day. I'm still learning from the people that are sitting in front of you and sitting in front of me." And he still seems in disbelief at his meteoric rise, remarking: "It's mad, what is going on?" before signing off with the motto of his beloved Liverpool FC: "You'll never walk alone." Seth Rogen also won a TV prize, and had a sense of deja-vu after setting an epsiode of his Apple TV comedy The Studio at the Golden Globes. "This is so weird, we just pretended to do this and now it's happening," he said when picking up the trophy for best TV comedy actor. "I thought the only way I would get to hold one is to create a whole show to give myself a fake one." Other TV winners included Jean Smart for Hacks, Noah Wyle for The Pitt and Michelle Williams for Dying for Sex. And the event's first ever award for best podcast went to Amy Poehler, a former Golden Globes host, for Good Hang with Amy Poehler.

### 5. [Meta blocks 550,000 accounts under Australia's social media ban](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpqye2yygl4o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

Meta blocks 550,000 accounts under Australia's social media ban About 550,000 accounts were blocked by Meta during the first days of Australia's landmark social media ban for kids. In December, a new law began requiring that the world's most popular social media sites - including Instagram and Facebook - stop Australians aged under 16 from having accounts on their platforms. The ban, which is being watched closely around the world, was justified by campaigners and the government as necessary to protect children from harmful content and algorithms. Companies including Meta have said they agree more is needed to keep young people safe online. However they continue to argue for other measures, with some experts raising similar concerns. "We call on the Australian government to engage with industry constructively to find a better way forward, such as incentivising all of industry to raise the standard in providing safe, privacy-preserving, age appropriate experiences online, instead of blanket bans," Meta said in a blog update. The company said it blocked 330,639 accounts on Instagram, 173,497 on Facebook, and 39,916 on Threads during it's first week of compliance with the new law. They again put the argument that age verification should happen at an app store level - something they suggested lowers the burden of compliance on both regulators and the apps themselves - and that exemptions for parental approval should be created. "This is the only way to guarantee consistent, industry-wide protections for young people, no matter which apps they use, and to avoid the whack-a-mole effect of catching up with new apps that teens will migrate to in order to circumvent the social media ban law." Various governments, from the US state of Florida to the European Union, have been experimenting with limiting children's use of social media. But, along with a higher age limit of 16, Australia is the first jurisdiction to deny an exemption for parental approval in a policy like this - making its laws the world's strictest. The policy is wildly popular with parents and envied by world leader, with the Tories this week pledging to follow suit if they win power at the next election, due before 2029. However some experts have raised concerns that Australian kids can circumvent the ban with relative ease - either by tricking the technology that's performing the age checks, or by finding other, potentially less safe, places on the net to gather. And backed by some mental health advocates, many children have argued it robs young people of connection - particularly those from LGBTQ+, neurodivergent or rural communities - and will leave them less equipped to tackle the realities of life on the web.

One person dead and 300 buildings destroyed in Australia bushfires One person has died and 300 properties have been destroyed in bushfires that have torn across south-east Australia. The fires have raged in dozens of locations across the country for several days, mostly in the state of Victoria, but also in New South Wales, burning through land almost twice the size of Greater London. A state of emergency has been declared in Victoria as thousands of firefighters and more than 70 aircraft battle the blaze. Residents in more than a dozen communities have been advised to leave their homes. Authorities fear the fires, which are being fuelled by very hot, dry and windy conditions, could burn for several weeks. Victoria's Premier Jacinta Allan said 30 active fires were burning across the state, 10 of which were of particular concern. She said 350,000 hectares had been burnt across the state as of 08:00 local time on Sunday (23:00 GMT on Saturday). "We will see fires continue for some time across the state and that is why we are not through the worst of this by a long way," she told Australian media. "There are fires that are continuing right now that are threatening homes and property." Human remains were found in the village of Gobur, near the town of Longwood, some 110km (70 sq miles) north of the state capital Melbourne, police said. The victim has not yet been identified. Allan praised the emergency workers who worked to retrieve the body. "This is difficult and confronting work, and it takes a heavy toll." "The Gobur community is grieving," she said. Bushfire smoke is impacting air quality in many areas across Victoria, including metropolitan Melbourne. Authorities said the fires were the worst to hit the south-east of Australia since the 2019-2020 blazes that destroyed an area the size of Turkey and killed 33 people. Hundreds more are believed to have died due to the effects of the smoke which choked towns and cities that summer. One of the worst-affected places is the small town of Harcourt in the central highlands of Victoria, where firefighter Tyrone Rice lost his own home in the blaze. He was out fighting one of the bushfires when he learned it was on fire. He told Australian media it was "like a kick in the guts, but I'm not the first person to go through it, and I won't be the last". The destruction in Harcourt was "gut-wrenching", local fire captain Andrew Wilson said. A reporter for Australia's 9 News, Jack Ward, told the BBC World Service he had visited the damage in several towns across eastern Australia. What he saw was "catastrophic", he said, and in many places, "all that's left of these houses is a tin roof lying on the ground". While it is hard to link individual wildfires to climate change as how humans manage the land can play a factor, scientists say climate change is making the hot, dry weather conditions conducive to bush fires more common.

Ai, Japanese chimpanzee who counted and painted, dies at 49 Ai, a female chimpanzee famous for her cognitive skills has died at 49, according to the Japanese institute where she lived. The Kyoto University's Center for the Evolutionary Origins of Human Behavior said Ai died on 9 January of old age and organ failure and that she was surrounded by staff when she died. Ai was born in western Africa and arrived at the Japanese institute in 1977. There, she became the namesake of the Ai Project, a research programme into the "chimpanzee mind". Among the institute's noteable findings were the fact that Ai was able to use numbers and identify colours. Researchers gave Ai a special keyboard linked to a computer when she was 18 months, a set-up that they used to study her memory and learning. At five years old, Ai "mastered numerical naming from one to six and was able to name the number, colour and object of 300 types of samples", according to a 1985 scientific paper by Tetsuro Matsuzawa, the primatologist behind the Ai Project. When she was not participating in cognitive tests, Ai was known to enjoy drawing and painting. Like other chimpanzees at the centre, Ai would scrawl marker pens over blank paper without having to be motivated by food rewards. Japanese media outlet Kyodo news reported that she once escaped with another primate - using a key to unlock her cage. In 2000 she gave birth to a son, Ayumu, who is also known for his remarkable memory. In 2017 - the 40th anniversary of the Ai Project - a scarf made from one of Ai's paintings was gifted to renowned primatologist Dame Jane Goodall.

**Excerpt**

Sudan's government returns to capital after nearly 3 years of war Sudan's military-led government has returned to the country's capital after nearly three years of operating from its wartime base in the eastern city of Port Sudan. Sudan's Prime Minister Kamil Idris told reporters on Sunday that the "government of hope" was officially back in Khartoum and would begin efforts to improve services for the city's beleaguered residents. The military was forced out by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) when civil war erupted between the two sides in 2023. The army recaptured it in a significant breakthrough last March. Khartoum has been recovering from years of fighting. Roughly five million fled the city at the height of the conflict, according to the UN. Those unwilling or unable to leave described a brutal RSF occupation, which included mass looting and fighters taking over civilian homes. Huge swathes of the city lie in ruins. In October, UN official Ugochi Daniels reported that basic services were "barely functioning". On Sunday, Idris said the government would work on improving electricity, water, healthcare and education in Khartoum. He also declared that 2026 would be a "year of peace" for Sudan, where at least 150,000 people have died since the war erupt. The UN has described the situation as the world's worst humanitarian crisis and around 12 million people have been forced from their homes. The war began after the head of the army, General Abdel Fattah-al Burhan fell out with his deputy and RSF leader General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, leading to a vicious struggle for power. Both the RSF and the Sudanese military have been accused of committing atrocities throughout the conflict. International efforts to broker peace have failed and both sides are backed by foreign powers who have poured weapons into the country. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has come under particular scrutiny recently over allegations of supporting the RSF, which it strongly denies.
