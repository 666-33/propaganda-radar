Referee and student among hundreds killed in Iran protests A referee and a student are among hundreds of people reportedly killed during massive anti-government protests in Iran. Coach Amir Mohammad Koohkan, 26, was hit by live ammunition on 3 January during protests in the town of Neyriz, his friend told BBC Persian. "Everyone knew him for his kindness", they said, adding his family is grieving and "angry because he was killed by the regime". Five days later, student Rubina Aminian, 23, was shot from behind during a protest in Tehran, according to human rights groups. "She fought for things she knew were right", her uncle told CNN. Nearly 500 protesters and 48 security personnel have been killed in two weeks of protests, a US-based rights group says. Sources in Iran have told the BBC the death toll is likely higher than reported. Demonstrations began on 28 December over the economy in the capital Tehran and have spread to 186 cities and all 31 provinces, according to the Human Rights Activist News Agency (HRANA). The protests have grown into the largest in years, with calls for an end to the Islamic Republic and rule of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The protests led to a government crackdown, with at least 10,600 people reportedly arrested and 496 protesters killed, according to HRANA. Medical staff in Iran have described hospitals overwhelmed with dead and injured patients. BBC Persian verified that 70 bodies were brought to Poursina Hospital in Rasht city on 9 January, and the BBC counted 180 body bags in footage from one morgue near Tehran thought to have been filmed on the same night. The BBC and most other international news organisations are unable to report from inside Iran, and the Iranian government has imposed an internet shutdown since Thursday, making obtaining and verifying information difficult. Among the protest victims was Koohkan, who was killed in Neyriz in south-west Fars Province, his friend told BBC Persian. The friend did not witness the incident firsthand, but heard from eyewitnesses at the scene. "It was far too soon for him, really far too soon. He was so young," the friend said. The friend said they had known Koohkan, an indoor futsal (a form of football) coach and referee, for 10 years: "From childhood he was my coach, then he became like my brother." They described Koohkan, who had one brother, as "someone who didn't like to see people in this state... in this misery". "Everyone knew him for his kindness and good nature. The whole town loved him," his friend said. "The family are both grieving and angry. Grieving because they lost their son, angry because he was killed by the regime." Also killed was Aminian, a Kurdish student who was shot from behind while taking part in a protest on Thursday, according to three rights groups. Two groups - Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHRNGO) and Kurdish organisation Hengaw - said she was shot in the head, while the Kurdistan Human Rights Network said she was shot in the back. Both Kurdish groups said she was shot by government forces. The BBC has been unable to independently verify the circumstances of her death. The 23-year-old, whose first name has also been spelled Robina or Roubina, was studying textile and fashion at Shariati Technical and Vocational College in Tehran, IHRNGO said. "She was a strong girl, a courageous girl, and she was not someone you could control and make decisions for," her uncle told CNN. "She fought for things she knew were right and fought hard." He added that she was "thirsty for freedom, thirsty for women's rights". "Overall, she was a girl who was alive, who lived." Members of Aminian's family travelled from their hometown in Kermanshah, western Iran, to Tehran to identify her body after learning of her death, a source close to the family told INRNGO. The family had to search through hundreds of bodies of young people killed in the protests at a location close to her college, the source said. "It wasn't just my daughter; I saw hundreds of bodies with my own eyes," Aminian's mother said, in a statement from the source. Iranian authorities allegedly initially refused to hand over Aminian's body to her family, then prevented her burial or mourning ceremonies in their hometown, the source said. The family was reportedly forced to bury her along the road between Kermanshah and Kamyaran. Iranian leader Khamenei has called anti-government protesters "troublemakers," while US President Donald Trump has threatened to intervene and said the US military is considering "very strong options". Iran has also accused protesters of being backed by the US and Israel. The protests have been the most widespread since an uprising in 2022 sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish woman who was detained by morality police for allegedly not wearing her hijab properly. Then, more than 550 people were killed and 20,000 detained, according to human rights groups.

Custody extended for owner of Swiss ski bar after deadly fire A judge in Switzerland has ordered that one of the two co-owners of the ski resort bar where 40 people died in a fire on New Year's Eve be kept in detention for 90 days. Swiss prosecutors have argued that Jacques Moretti, a French national, is a potential flight risk. He and his wife Jessica, who is also French, are suspected of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence. The blaze at Le Constellation bar in Crans-Montana also left 116 people injured. Many of the victims were aged under 20. The fire is believed to have been started by sparklers in champagne bottles raised too close to the ceiling during celebrations. Authorities acknowledged last week that the bar in the popular ski resort had not undergone safety checks for five years. Jacques Moretti was first detained on Friday for an initial period of 48 hours. On Monday, a judge at what is known as a court of coercive measures ruled that he should be kept in custody for three months - a period that can be renewed under Swiss law. It is known as provisional - or preventive - detention and is meant to last until a case goes to court. In this instance, the court said the measure may be lifted upon payment of bail, whose sum would be set later. The couple were placed under criminal investigation days after the devastating fire. Moretti's wife, Jessica, who is under house arrest, told reporters on Friday that she was sorry about the "unthinkable tragedy". The prosecutors have said they believe the fire started when people celebrating the New Year raised champagne bottles with sparklers attached, setting light to sound-insulating foam on the ceiling of the basement bar. The news that the bar had not been inspected for five years has shocked families of the victims. Venues like Le Constellation should have been checked annually, but Crans-Montana Mayor Nicolas Feraud said on Tuesday he could not explain why this had not been done for so long at that bar. "We regret that - we owe it to the families and we will accept the responsibility," he said. He added that sparklers would be banned in local venues. Most of the victims of the fire were young - eight were under the age of 16. Many of the injured have severe burns. Eighty remain in hospitals in Switzerland and other European countries.

**Excerpt**

Jailed Venezuelan politician's son says Trump shouldn't be 'fooled' by pledge of prisoner releases The son of a jailed Venezuelan opposition leader has warned Donald Trump to "not be fooled" by the country's government, amid accusations it has not kept its promise to release a significant number of political prisoners. Ramón Guanipa, the son of Juan Pablo Guanipa, said he believed the US president was unaware that only about 40 releases out of more than 800 political prisoners had reportedly been confirmed so far. On Saturday, Trump thanked the Venezuelan authorities, saying they had "started the process, in a BIG WAY". The Venezuelan government announced on Thursday it would release detainees considered political prisoners by human rights groups as a "goodwill gesture". The move came after the US seized Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro in a raid on the capital, Caracas, on 3 January, and took him to New York, where he has been charged with drug trafficking. Jorge Rodríguez, Venezuela's National Assembly leader and the brother of Interim President Delcy Rodríguez, announced that an "important number of Venezuelan and foreign detainees" would be released "immediately". On Monday, the government said more than 100 such prisoners had already been released - a number far greater than the figure so far confirmed by human rights campaigners. Among those who are confirmed to have been released are several high-profile opposition figures - with Spain's foreign ministry confirming that five Spanish citizens had been freed, including human rights lawyer Rocío San Miguel. Trump claimed credit for the releases, writing on social media on Saturday: "I hope these prisoners will remember how lucky they got that the USA came along and did what had to be done." But relatives of those still behind bars have been expressing their frustration that only a small number of prisoners have been freed. Ramón Guanipa, whose father is a close ally of opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize laureate María Corina Machado, told BBC Mundo: "I want to tell President Trump that he must not be fooled and [should] keep pressure on these guys." He added: "I want to thank President Trump for the pressure that he's been enforcing. He's been our greatest ally in this situation." However, pointing to the small number of people released so far, Guanipa warned Trump that "if he thinks this is going alright, it is not". Ramón Guanipa says he has only been allowed to visit his father once since the older man was arrested. Juan Pablo Guanipa went into hiding after being accused of terrorism and treason for challenging the result of the 2024 presidential election. That vote was lacked "basic transparency and integrity", according to the UN, and was denounced as rigged by the US which did not recognise Maduro as Venezuela's legitimate leader. For his comments, Juan Pablo Guanipa was tracked down by Venezuelan security forces and detained in May 2025. After hearing about the planned prisoner release, Ramón Guanipa took the first available flight from Maracaibo, in the west of the country, to Caracas. "When they tell you they're going to release your family, everything else becomes small," he explained. But when his father was not among those freed, he felt "defeated". "But at the same time, you find another reason to fight. I'm fighting for them [the interim government] to actually do what they say they're going to do." The Venezuelan government has not commented on the pace of the releases, and the attorney general has declined a BBC interview request. The developments are being viewed as the first test of Trump's influence in Venezuela following the removal of Maduro. Interim President Delcy Rodríguez has appeared to welcome co-operation with the Trump administration, but her public statements have condemned any form of US intervention. The government's announcement about prisoner releases came a day after Trump said that the Venezuelan authorities would shut down El Helicoide, the country's most notorious prison. El Helicoide was originally designed to be a shopping centre and a symbol of Venezuela's oil-fuelled prosperity, but became a fortress of political repression under Maduro. Outside El Helicoide in western Caracas, the atmosphere is tense, with relatives keeping vigil. Carmen Farfán's son, José Gregorio Reyes, was detained along with his wife and a friend, while he was in hospital in western Venezuela. Their families have heard nothing since. Farfán does not know where her son is being held but has come to El Helicoide to join others in pleading for their relatives' release - wherever they may be. Beside her, Reyes' sister-in-law, cries as she describes how the three were arrested in November 2025. "We hope they tell us where they are keeping them. We are desperate. We've been waiting for many days without any answers," Farfán says. Venezuela's opposition and human rights groups have long accused the government of using detentions to stamp out dissent and silence critics, but officials repeatedly denied Venezuela held any political prisoners, arguing those detained were arrested for criminal activity. Opposition activists have described the release of political prisoners as an "urgent" step towards any transition of power. However, the small number freed so far has raised doubts about the interim government's intentions and questions over the extent of its willingness to cooperate with the US.

Thousands of tourists stranded in Lapland as cold grounds flights Thousands of tourists have been stranded in Finland's Lapland as a severe cold spell has grounded flights out of one of its airports. Departures from Lapland's Kittila airport that would have ferried winter travellers back to places like London, Bristol, Manchester, Paris and Amsterdam were all cancelled on Sunday as temperatures did not go above -35C on Sunday. The issue is expected to continue on Monday as a low of -39C is forecast by Finland's meteorological agency. The first flight out of Kittila has already been cancelled. The extreme cold makes it hard to de-ice planes, while maintenance and refuelling equipment on the ground can freeze. Airport operator Finavia told public broadcaster Yle that moisture in the air was making the situation worse as it was creating slippery frost. While Lapland - which spans northern Norway, Sweden and Finland - is known for the cold and snow, Finnish Lapland usually has a winter average temperature of -14C, with occasional dips to -30C, according to the nation's tourism board. Kittila airport predominantly serves people wishing to travel to nearby ski resorts and to see the Northern Lights, while Rovaniemi airport further south is the "official" destination for visitors to Santa Claus's folkloric home. On Monday, the first local flight set to arrive in Kittila was cancelled, with international flights delayed. The cold weather has also made the roads particularly hazardous, with Fintraffic warning of icy conditions in the region. A bus full of Ukrainian passengers drove into a ditch on Sunday morning, Yle reported, citing local police. It said no serious injuries were reported. The unusual cold in Lapland comes as a storm passing over northern Europe has brought wintry conditions and travel disruption to the UK, France and Germany. A man was killed after a tree fell on his caravan in England, while around 100,000 homes were without power in France on Saturday.

**Excerpt**

Hungary grants asylum to Polish ex-justice minister Hungary has granted political asylum to Poland's former Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro who is facing charges of embezzlement. Ziobro is facing 26 charges related to embezzling money from a fund meant to be spent on crime victims and rehabilitating criminals. Instead, he is accused of authorising the purchase of spyware that was allegedly used to hack political opponents' phones. He says he is a victim of political persecution. Granting asylum to a citizen of a fellow EU member state goes against the spirit of EU standards. But in the case of Hungary it is neither new nor surprising. Ziobro is the second politician of the former Justice and Law-led government to be granted this status - last year it was his former deputy Michal Romanowski who fled to Budapest to seek protection. Both are accused of corruption and misusing their power - most notably by using the money of the state-controlled Foundation for Justice which was under their oversight in order to fund their party and its cronies. Ziobro was justice minister between 2015 and 2023 under the previous right-wing PiS-led government, which is politically aligned to Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. If found guilty he could face up to 25 years in prison. Writing on X, Ziobro said: "I have decided to accept the asylum granted to me by the government of Hungary due to the political persecution in Poland." "I have chosen to fight against political banditry and lawlessness. I stand in opposition to a creeping dictatorship," Ziobro added, accusing Prime Minister Donald Tusk of waging a "vendetta" against him. Ziobro is accused of authorising a 25m zloty ($7m; £5.15m) purchase from of Israeli-made Pegasus spyware, which Poland's current coalition government and a European Parliament investigative team found was used to secretly hack the phones of political opponents. Current Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said his phone was hacked and Tusk said his wife's and daughter's phones were also hacked. Ziobro is also accused of awarding Justice Fund grants to fire stations and women's associations without proper competition to bolster support for the government. As minister of justice from 2015 to 2023, Ziobro was the author of judiciary reforms which provoked a major conflict with Brussels. The issue led to a freeze of EU money for Poland as well as to verdicts of the European Court of Justice, which deemed them as violating fundamental EU rules and standards including the principle of judicial independence. Orban, who faced similar criticism, and the PiS rejected and ignored those rulings, saying they violated Poland's sovereignty and constituted an overreach of Brussels's powers. Ziobro is thus for Orban not just and not primarily a representative of an allied party, but most importantly a brother-in-arms in defence of national sovereignty against alleged EU oppression. Orban wants to present himself as the leader of the "patriotic" movement in Europe and Ziobro's request for asylum comes in very handy for him to pursue this goal.

**Excerpt**

Five decapitated heads displayed on Ecuador beach Bathers found five decapitated heads displayed on a beach in Ecuador in what appears to be a warning to gang members who have been threatening local fishermen. The gruesome discovery was made on Sunday on the beachfront in Puerto López, a town which has been wracked by gang violence. Next to the body parts, locals found a sign threatening those stealing from and extorting fishermen with the same fate. Ports and towns by the Pacific Ocean are among those worst hit by gangs which smuggle cocaine from Ecuador to the US and Europe. Police have identified the remains as those of five men who had been reported missing days earlier. They ranged between 20 and 34 years in age. Officials told local media one of them had a criminal record for gun possession. Their bodies have not yet been located. According to figures released by the interior ministry, 2025 was the most violent on record in Ecuador, with homicide rates reaching an all-time high at 9,176 murders. Ecuador - which is located between Colombia and the Peru, the world's two largest producers of cocaine - has become a key transit country for illegal drugs. Local gangs have forged alliances with powerful Mexican and Colombian drug cartels, counternarcotics experts say. As well as smuggling drugs, the criminal gangs force local businesses to pay "protection money" and attack those who refuse. On 28 December, six people - including a two-year-old child - were killed and another three injured when gunmen opened fire at a group of people standing on the beachfront in Puerto López. Police said the shooting and another the previous day, in which another three people were killed, were triggered by a battle for control of the town between two rival factions of the Los Choneros gang. Los Choneros is one of the main drivers of the deadly gang violence which has rocked Ecuador. In September, the US state department added the group to its list of Foreign Terrorist Organisations. Its leader, known as Fito, was extradited to the United States in July of last year.

Monkeys on the loose in St Louis after four-day search Multiple monkeys are on the loose in St Louis, Missouri, sparking confusion and concern from the city's animal control officials, who said they do not know where the primates came from. The monkeys have been running free since at least Thursday, when they were first spotted roaming the streets. Residents have been warned to avoid the exotic animals, as they could be "unpredictable or aggressive under stress". It is unclear how many monkeys are at large, but officials believe there is more than one, and initial reports suggested there were four. Despite search efforts, the primates had not been found as of Sunday evening, the city's health department, which handles animal control, told BBC News. A primate expert from St Louis Zoo has identified the animals as vervet monkeys, the health department said. Vervets are small monkeys, native to Africa, with pale fur and black faces. The health department describes them as "very intelligent and social" but warns of their potential danger if stressed. "At this time, we do not know where these animals came from," said Justen Hauser, the St Louis health department's bureau chief of environmental health. Owning exotic animals like primates is prohibited in St Louis, he added, so officials are not aware of any homes where "illegal monkeys" may have been kept. Sightings of the monkeys have been reported in the O'Fallon Park neighbourhood in the north of the city, and Hauser believed they were still in this area on Sunday. "Original reports suggested there were four animals, but we cannot confirm an actual number at this time, only that there is more than one," Hauser said. Marva Young, who lives in the neighbourhood, told local news network KSDK: "I think of the danger, because that's a wild animal." Another resident told the network it was "crazy" that they could be nearby. Pictures of the primates perched on a porch-side wall and standing on two legs near a parked car have been shared on social media. Animal care and control officers have patrolled the area but have not yet managed to locate the monkeys. "We are working to get an idea of where they may be hiding or seeking food," Hauser said. "We want to stress that residents should not approach these monkeys or try to capture them." Instead, people should report sightings to the health department, he said. "Once captured, the monkeys will be transported to a facility certified to care for exotic animals." Though owning primates in the city is prohibited, a St Louis Public Radio report from last year said Missouri ranked highly in primate ownership, with "at least 35 to 50 primates" bought and sold each year. The monkeys are not native to the US, but a colony of vervets lives in the wild in Florida. They are believed to be the descendants of escapees from a research centre near Fort Lauderdale in the 1940s.

### 10. [Trump tells Cuba to 'make a deal, before it is too late'](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2kv2gn62vo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

Trump tells Cuba to 'make a deal, before it is too late' Donald Trump has urged Cuba to "make a deal" or face consequences, warning that the flow of Venezuelan oil and money would now stop. The US president has been turning his attention to Cuba since US forces seized Venezuela's leader Nicolás Maduro in a 3 January raid on its capital, Caracas. Venezuela, a long-standing ally of Cuba, is believed to send around 35,000 barrels of oil a day to the island. Cuba's foreign minister responded by saying his nation retained the right to import fuel "without interference", while its president said: "No one dictates what we do." The Trump administration's tactic of confiscating sanctioned Venezuelan oil tankers has already begun to worsen a fuel and electricity crisis in Cuba. On Friday, it seized a fifth oil tanker it said was carrying sanctioned oil from Venezuela. "Cuba lived, for many years, on large amounts of OIL and MONEY from Venezuela. In return, Cuba provided 'Security Services' for the last two Venezuelan dictators, BUT NOT ANYMORE!" Trump posted on Truth Social on Sunday. "THERE WILL BE NO MORE OIL OR MONEY GOING TO CUBA - ZERO! I strongly suggest they make a deal, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE." Trump did not specify the terms of a deal or the consequences Cuba could face. But Cuban foreign minister Bruno Rodriguez said the Caribbean island nation had "the absolute right to import fuel" from any willing exporter "without interference or subordination to the unilateral coercive measures of the United States". He added that, unlike the US, Cuba does not lend itself to "blackmail or military coercion against other States". Trump also referenced the raid to seize Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, who are now facing drug trafficking and other charges in the US. Cuba has for years supplied Maduro with his personal security detail. The Cuban government said 32 of its nationals were killed during the US operation in the Venezuelan capital, Caracas. Trump said: "Most of those Cubans are DEAD from last week's USA attack, and Venezuela doesn't need protection anymore from the thugs and extortionists who held them hostage for so many years. "Venezuela now has the United States of America, the most powerful military in the World (by far!), to protect them, and protect them we will." Rodriguez said Cuba had "never received monetary or material compensation for the security services it has provided to any country". While the Trump administration has not stated clear plans for Cuba, the US president has previously said that a military intervention was unnecessary because the country was "ready to fall". US Secretary of State Marco Rubio indicated last week that Cuba's leaders should be worried, saying that he would be "concerned" if he were in the Cuban government and that "they're in a lot of trouble". On Sunday, Trump also re-posted on social media a message suggesting that Rubio - a Cuban-American former Florida senator and the son of Cuban exiles - could become president of Cuba. Trump shared that post with the comment: "Sounds good to me!" Trump has increasingly framed US policy through the lens of a revived 1823 "Monroe Doctrine" that promises US supremacy in the western hemisphere - re-branding it the "Donroe Doctrine". The last few months of US foreign policy have becoming increasingly focused on Latin America and the left-wing leaders with whom he has ideological differences, with US actions justified as combatting drug trafficking. After the unprecedented raid on Caracas, Trump said a military operation targeting Colombia "sounds good" and has repeatedly told its President Gustavo Petro to "watch his ass". The US imposed sanctions on Petro - Colombia's first left-wing leader - in October, saying he was allowing drug cartels to "flourish". Trump has also said that drugs were "pouring" through Mexico into the US, adding "we're gonna have to do something". The US president he has offered to send US troops to Mexico to combat cartels, but President Claudia Sheinbaum has publicly rejected any US military action on Mexican soil. The US and Cuba have had a strained relationship since the communist Fidel Castro overthrew a US-backed government in 1959. While steps were taken to improve diplomatic relations, particularly under former US President Barack Obama, the Trump administration has reversed many of these moves. Shortly after being sworn in to a second term, Trump reinstated Cuba's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism, which had been lifted just days before by the then-President Joe Biden. Cuba's President Miguel Diaz-Canel said on Sunday: "Those who turn everything into a business, even human lives, have no moral authority to point fingers at Cuba for anything, absolutely anything. "Those who today hysterically rail against our nation do so out of rage over the sovereign decision of this people to choose their political model."

More federal agents to be sent to Minnesota, Trump administration says The Trump administration has said it will send "hundreds more" federal officers to Minneapolis, days after the death of a woman who was shot by a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent in the city. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem told Fox News that "hundreds more" will be sent to the area "in order to allow our ICE and our Border Patrol individuals that are working in Minneapolis to do so safely". Protests against immigration enforcement have been held in cities across the US after 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good was shot in her car on Wednesday. The Trump administration says the agent acted in self-defence. Local officials insist the woman posed no danger. Noem said the officers will arrive "today and tomorrow" and warned action would be taken if people tried to obstruct their work. "If they conduct violent activities against law enforcement, if they impede our operations, that's a crime, and we will hold them accountable to those consequences," she said. Protesters gathered in Minneapolis on Saturday, with anti-ICE protests also taking place elsewhere in the US, including in Austin, Seattle, New York and Los Angeles. Minneapolis police estimated "tens of thousands of people" attended the "ICE out of Minnesota" rally and march, which started in Powderhorn Park on Saturday. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said the protest was "peaceful". Police said 31 people had been arrested after protests on Friday and Saturday. Minnesota has already seen a surge of federal law enforcement officials as the Trump administration ramps up immigration enforcement in the state. Speaking to CNN, Noem also doubled down on her assessment that Good was committing an act of "domestic terrorism", saying she had "weaponised" her car" to attack ICE agents. In response to her comments, Frey told CNN: "Anybody can see that this victim is not a domestic terrorist", and he said her actions were of someone trying to do a three-point turn to escape the scene. The Minneapolis mayor added that the city's local law enforcement were "outnumbered by the number of ICE agents and beyond". On Sunday, Minnesota senator Tina Smith, a Democrat, accused the Trump administration of trying to cover up the shooting. "I think what we are seeing here is the federal government, Kristi Noem, Vice President Vance, Donald Trump, attempting to cover up what happened here," Smith told ABC News. "I don't think that people here and around the country are believing it," she added. In a statement, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson accused Smith of lying, saying: "Tina's lies only serve to further inflame tensions and incite violence against law enforcement officers." Videos of the incident show ICE agents approaching a car which is in the middle of the street, and telling the woman behind the wheel to get out of the SUV. One of the agents tugs at the driver's side door handle. As the vehicle attempts to drive off, one of the agents at the front of the car points their gun at the driver and several shots are heard. The car then continues to drive away from the officer and crashes into the side of the street. Good's wife told local media the pair had gone to the scene of immigration enforcement activity to support neighbours. The officer who fired on Good is Jonathan Ross, a veteran ICE agent who was previously injured in the line of duty when he was struck by a car. The FBI has said it will investigate the shooting. On Friday, Minnesota officials said they would open their own inquiry after saying they had been frozen out of the federal investigation. Previously, US Vice-President JD Vance said the investigation is a federal issue.

Are You Dead?: The viral Chinese app for young people living alone A new bleak-sounding app has taken China by storm. Named Are You Dead? the concept is simple. You need to check in with it every two days – clicking a large button – to confirm that you are alive. If not, it will get in touch with your appointed emergency contact and inform them that you may be in trouble. It was launched in May last year to not much fanfare but attention around it has exploded in recent weeks with many young people, who live alone in Chinese cities, downloading it in droves. This has propelled it to become the most downloaded paid app in the country. According to research institutions, there may be up to 200 million one-person households in China by 2030, Chinese state media outlet Global Times reports. And it's those people that the app - which describes itself as a "safety company companion... whether you're a solo office worker, a student living away from home, or anyone choosing a solitary lifestyle" - is trying to target. "People who live alone at any stage of their life need something like this, as do introverts, those with depression, the unemployed and others in vulnerable situations," said one user on Chinese social media. "There is a fear that people living alone might die unnoticed, with no one to call for help. I sometimes wonder, if I died alone, who would collect my body?" said another. Wilson Hou, 38, who lives around 100km (62 miles) from his family, says that is exactly why he downloaded the app. He works in the capital Beijing. He returns home to his wife and child twice a week, but says he has to be away from them at the moment to work on a project and he mostly sleeps on site. "I worry that if something happened to me, I could die alone in the place I rent and no-one would know," he said. "That's why I downloaded the app and I set my mum as my emergency contact." He also added that he downloaded the app quickly after its release, fearing it would be banned because of the negative connotations around it. Some have been quick to bash the app's less than cheery name - saying that signing up for it might bring ill fortune. Others have called for it to be changed to something with a more positive spin, like "Are you ok?" or "How are you?". And though the success of this app must be, in part, because of its catchy-sounding name, the company behind the app, Moonscape Technologies, has said it is taking on board the criticism of the current title and weighing up a potential name change. The app, which is listed internationally under the name Demumu, ranks in the top two in the US, Singapore and Hong Kong, and top four in Australia and Spain for paid utility apps - possibly driven by Chinese users living overseas. The current name is a word play on a successful food delivery app called "Are you Hungry?". In Chinese, "Si-le-ma" sounds like the name of the food app "E-le-ma". First launched as a free app, the app has now made its way into the paid category - albeit at the low price of 8 yuan ($1.15; £0.85). Little is known about the founders of Are You Dead?, but they say they are three people who were born after 1995 who built the app from Zhengzhou in Henan with a small team. It has certainly grown in value now. One of these men, who goes by the name Mr Guo, told Chinese media that they intended to raise money by selling 10% of the company for a million yuan. That is a lot more than the 1,000 yuan ($140) they say it cost to build the app. And they're also looking to grow their target audience - saying they are exploring the idea of a new product specifically designed for the elderly in a country where over one-fifth of its population is over the age of 60. In an indication that it was seriously looking at this option, it posted over the weekend, "we would like to call on more people to pay attention to the elderly who are living at home, to give them more care and understanding. They have dreams, strive to live, and deserve to be seen, respected and protected." The company has not responded to questions from the BBC.

**Excerpt**

He once criticised African leaders who cling to power. Now he wants a seventh term Ugandans under the age of 40 - and that is more than three-quarters of the population - have only known one president. Yoweri Museveni seized the top job in 1986 following an armed uprising and at the age of 81, he shows no signs of budging. His time at the helm has been accompanied by a long period of peace and significant development, for which many are grateful. But his critics say he has maintained his grip on power through a mixture of sidelining opponents and compromising independent institutions. "We don't believe in [presidential] term limits," he once told the BBC, secure in his role after winning a fifth election. A year later, the age limit for a presidential candidate was removed - paving the way, many believe, for Museveni to become president for life. Museveni's journey began in 1944, when he was born into a family of cattle keepers in Ankole, western Uganda. He came of age during Uganda's struggle for independence from the UK, which was followed by a period of brutality and turbulence under Milton Obote and Idi Amin. For many years, Museveni did not know his birth date, writing in his memoir: "We had real life-threatening challenges such as extra-judicial killings and looting… we had no time to worry about details such as dates of birth." In 1967, Museveni left Uganda to attend the University of Dar es Salaam in neighbouring Tanzania. There, he studied economics and political science and forged alliances with politically active students from around the region. Museveni's name gained currency in the 1970s, after a coup by the notorious Amin. Museveni helped form the Front for National Salvation - one of the rebel groups that, with Tanzania's help, ousted Amin. Amin was infamous for crushing dissent and expelling the country's Asian community. Under his eight-year rule an estimated 400,000 people were killed. "He was part of the colonial system," Museveni told the Global Indian Network in a recent interview. "Idi Amin was ignorant... a bit chauvinistic". Following Amin's fall, former President Milton Obote returned to power via a general election. However, Museveni refused to accept Obote's leadership, claiming the vote had been rigged. He launched a guerrilla struggle in 1981 and five years later, his rebel group, the National Resistance Movement (NRM), seized power and Museveni became leader. Uganda's economy began to grow steadily and over 10 years, the country saw an average annual growth of more than 6%. Primary school enrolment doubled and HIV levels dropped because of an anti-Aids campaign spearheaded by the president. Museveni became a darling of the West, but his reputation took a hit in 1998, when Uganda and Rwanda invaded neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo in support of rebels fighting to overthrow the government. Around this time, critics also complained that the president was growing less tolerant of opposing views. It also became clear he had no plans to cede power. Museveni had said, in a 1986 collection of writing: "The problem of Africa in general, and Uganda in particular, is not the people but leaders who want to overstay in power." But by 2005 his views had seemingly changed and Uganda's constitution was amended, removing the cap on how many terms a president could serve. In 2017, the age limit for presidential candidates was also eliminated - a move which led to MPs throwing chairs in a chaotic parliamentary brawl. Museveni has also faced allegations that he has weakened the independence of key institutions. In particular, Uganda's judiciary has been accused of recruiting so-called "cadre judges" whose loyalty lies with the government. When judges have gone against the government, they have sometimes found themselves at loggerheads with the authorities. For example, in December 2005, armed security personnel raided the High Court in the capital, Kampala, re-arresting members of a suspected rebel group, who had just been acquitted of treason charges. The media has also had its independence threatened. On the surface, Uganda has a lively media industry, but numerous outlets have been raided and journalists detained. Perhaps the most significant factor in Museveni's longevity is the neutering of potential opposition forces. When it became clear that Museveni did not intend to leave power, some of his former associates started to break away. As they did, the security agencies turned their attention to them. For instance, Kizza Besigye of the opposition Forum for Democratic Change, who was once Museveni's doctor, first ran against the president in 2001. Since then, he has been arrested and prosecuted numerous times. In 2024, he mysteriously disappeared in Nairobi, only to appear four days later in a Ugandan military court. He remains in jail on treason charges, which he denies. Pop star-turned-politician Bobi Wine is the latest Museveni critic to face the wrath of the state. The 43-year-old opposition leader, whose star power draws huge crowds of youngsters, has been arrested, imprisoned and charged with crimes including treason. These have all later been dropped. In 2021 the police tear-gassed and even shot at Bobi Wine and his supporters, saying they had defied coronavirus restrictions on large gatherings. During the current campaign period, security forces have used "firearms and live ammunition to disperse peaceful assemblies" and abducted opposition party members in unmarked vans, a UN report says. Amid this environment, Museveni ominously told the public that "one soldier carries 120 bullets". However, he also ordered the police not to beat opposition supporters and use tear gas instead. Museveni's supporters point to the relative stability Uganda has enjoyed in the decades he has been in power. Emmanuel Lumala Dombo, a spokesperson for the NRM, points out that more than 1.7 million people have moved to Uganda after fleeing strife in their own countries. "Forty years ago, we were among the biggest exporters of refugees among the neighbouring countries that surround us," Dombo told the BBC. "Right now Uganda is the biggest host of refugees in Africa." This sentiment was echoed by a Museveni supporter who had, surprisingly, turned up to a Bobi Wine rally. Ndyasima Patrick told the BBC he would vote for Museveni because "he has kept us alive for all these years". He also respects Museveni's age and feels Bobi Wine would only be ready to lead Uganda when he hits his 50s. Museveni's government has recently been encouraging foreign investment, striking deals with the likes of China, the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates. He says he wants Uganda to become a middle-income country by 2040. Museveni sees himself not only as a stable, ambitious presence, but also as a nurturing figure for Uganda's youth. He fondly calls his young followers Bazukulu (meaning grandchildren in the Luganda language) and they refer to him by the nicknames M7 or Sevo. But with an eye on Bobi Wine, who is roughly half of Museveni's age, the president has been keen to show his vitality. In 2020, to encourage exercise during lockdown he was filmed doing press-ups, and then repeated the trick several times that year, including in front of cheering students. He has addressed his health on numerous occasions, saying late last year: "I have been here with you for 40 years now. Have you ever heard that I have been in hospital? Except when I had [coronavirus] for 21 days." As Museveni ages, critics worry that he is turning the country into his family's fiefdom. They note that the president's wife, Janet, is the education minister and his son, Gen Muhoozi Kainerugaba is head of the army. Museveni's grandson also enrolled into the army in July, a move seen as potentially perpetuating the family dynasty. The NRM has said little about how it will manage Museveni's succession, but speculation that 51-year-old Gen Kainerugaba will step up is rife. Should this come to pass, it could jeopardise Museveni's legacy of stability. Gen Kainerugaba is known for being unpredictable and provocative, especially on social media. He has used X to joke about invading Kenya, rile Ethiopia by backing Egypt during a dispute between the two countries and admit to detaining Bobi Wine's bodyguard in his basement. At the moment, however, with almost four decades of experience behind him, Museveni is confident he will bag a seventh victory. "Uganda is secure. Go out and vote," he told the public during a New Year's Eve address. "The Ugandan NRM are unstoppable."
