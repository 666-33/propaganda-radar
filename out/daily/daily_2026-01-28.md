South Korea's ex-first lady jailed for 20 months for bribery The wife of South Korea's ousted former president has been sentenced to 20 months in jail for accepting bribes from the controversial Unification Church. However, the court cleared 52-year-old Kim Keon Hee on charges of stock price manipulation and receiving free opinion polls from a political broker before the 2022 presidential election, which her husband Yoon Suk Yeol won. Yoon has already been sentenced to five years' in jail for abusing power and obstructing justice in relation to his failed martial law bid in 2024. This marks the first time in South Korea's history that a former presidential couple are convicted at the same time. On Wednesday, Judge Woo In-sung at the Seoul Central District Court ruled that Kim had "misused her position as a means of pursuing personal gain". "The higher [one's] position, the more consciously one must guard against such conduct... The defendant failed to reject solicitations and was preoccupied with self-adornment," the judge said. In a statement after the verdict, Kim said: "I humbly accept the court's sterm admonition and will not take its weight lightly". "Once again, I sincerely apologise to everyone for the concern I have caused," she added. Kim had previously denied all charges. A special counsel team appointed to the case said Kim received 80m ($56,000; £40,600) won of gifts, which include a Graff diamond necklace and several Chanel handbags, from the Unification Chruch between April and July 2022, in exchange for business and political favours. The team had sought a 15-year jail term and a fine of 2 billion won for all three charges heard on Wednesday – for which Kim was convicted of one – but the judge noted that Kim was not the one who demanded or solicited the bribes, and that she had "no significant criminal record". She was however ordered to pay back 12.85 million won in cash and the court also ordered the confiscation of the diamond necklace. Kim has also been charged over her alleged involvement in a scheme to recruit Unification Church followers to the conservative People Power Party that her husband was part of, and accepting gifts in exchange for government job appointments. The court has yet to hear those cases. The former first lady had denied all charges, saying they were "deeply unjust", although she did admit to receiving Chanel bags, which she said she later returned without using. She made a public apology when she appeared for questioning last August. "I am truly sorry that a nobody like me has caused concern to the people," she said. Investigations into Kim's dealings with the Unification Church had also led to the arrest of church leader Han Hak-ja. Apart from the criminal allegations, Kim has also been the subject of other controversies. Last year, Sookmyung Women's University annulled an art education degree she graduated with in 1999, after an ethics panel found she had plagiarised her master's thesis.

Former French senator found guilty of drugging MP A former French senator has been found guilty of spiking an MP's drink with ecstasy in order to sexually assault her. Joel Guerriau received a four-year prison sentence - 18 months of which are to be served behind bars. He was also ordered to pay Sandrine Josso €5,000 (£4,350) in damages for emotional distress. Guerriau, now 68, invited Josso, 50, to his Paris flat in November 2023. He later admitted serving her a drink spiked with MDMA, but maintained it was an accident and denied having any intention of assaulting her. Shortly after the verdict on Tuesday, Josso said the sentence was a "huge relief". Guerriau's lawyers said he would appeal. According to court documents quoted by French media, Josso said she had gone to Guerrieau's home three years ago to celebrate his re-election when she started feeling unwell after drinking from a champagne glass. "I had gone to visit a friend and I discovered an aggressor," she said on Monday while giving evidence in the trial. "He looked at me insistently, I'd never seen him that way. I didn't want to show him my weakness, because I was worried that if I told him I wasn't feeling well, he would've forced me to lie down." Josso recalled managing to leave the flat and, with the help of a colleague, went to hospital where a toxicology report confirmed her blood had three times the recreational dose of MDMA. Guerriau told the court he had been going through a period of depression, and had meant to take the drug himself the night before. He did not end up doing so and accidentally offered the glass containing MDMA to Josso the following evening, he said. "I feel sorry for Sandrine," Guerriau told the court in Paris. "I am disgusted with myself, with my recklessness and my stupidity." He added: "We don't talk about the effects of these drugs enough... All I want is to speak out on the dangers of these products." Asked about the several internet searches he made around ecstasy and the drug GHB, he said he had no recollection. "I was on the train, thoughts and ideas just come to you," he told the court, adding government members needed to show an interest in "all current events". Guerriau, a centre-right senator from the Horizons party, was suspended when the charges against him came to light. He resigned as a senator last October. Josso, who is still an MP for the centre-right MoDem, has become a staunch campaigner against so-called chemical submission - drug-facilitated sexual assault. "What I went through is still very painful," Josso said, speaking to French media ahead of the trial beginning. "Psychological trauma feels like being frozen in time... I jump at the slightest thing. I've become very vulnerable." Josso has gone on to join an association against chemical submission, set up by Caroline Darian - the daughter of Dominique Pelicot, who in 2024 was found guilty of drugging his wife Gisele and inviting men to rape her in their home for over a decade. Josso was often in court during the Pelicot trial. This week, Darian and her brother David attended the proceedings in the Guerriau case.

**Excerpt**

Republicans wrestle with immigration message after Minneapolis backlash Republican lawmakers are starting to break with the Trump administration over its immigration crackdown in Minneapolis, as the party scrambles to respond to growing public anger after two US citizens were killed by federal agents. But even as some Republicans in Washington speak out against the fatal shootings, they've avoided directly criticising President Donald Trump or his broader immigration agenda. The emerging messaging on Minneapolis points to the party's main dilemma heading into the midterm elections. The dilemma is whether and how to distance itself from the biggest controversies of Trump's second term, while running on his overall record on immigration and other issues. That record is popular on the right, and is something that most Republicans helped push through Congress. The party's response to the fast-moving events in Minneapolis underscores the delicate balancing act. Public anger forces a new focus So far, Republicans have focused criticism on US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE - the agency at the forefront of the Minneapolis operation - and other agencies within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) taking part. At the same time, Republicans have backed Trump's immigration plans since his return to the White House, but now avoid highlighting their support. Last year, the Republican-controlled Congress approved roughly $45bn (£33bn) for border security and additional funding for interior enforcement to help the administration carry out Trump's plan to deport millions of undocumented migrants from the country. That support has continued even as opinion polls consistently show a majority of Americans believe ICE has gone too far in its tactics under Trump. A New York Times/Siena poll out last Friday found that 61% of voters believe ICE's tactics have "gone too far". The survey came out two weeks after Renee Good, a US citizen, was fatally shot by a federal agent in Minneapolis - and one day before another American citizen, Alex Pretti, was killed by agents in the city, which sparked nationwide protests. In the same poll, about half of voters said they approved of the administration deporting those living illegally in the US, and about half approved of its approach on the southern border. In the face of public outcry over the killings, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, the chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs, called on Monday for the leaders of ICE and two other federal agencies to testify before his panel next month. The request came alongside calls from other Senate Republicans for more oversight of ICE after Pretti's shooting. "The tragedy and chaos the country is witnessing in Minneapolis is shocking," Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska wrote on social media. "ICE agents do not have carte blanche in carrying out their duties." Murkowski's condemnation does not come as a major surprise. The Alaska moderate is one of a small handful of Republicans in Congress who've been willing to openly criticise Trump since he first entered office. Paul also has clashed with the president and administration on issues in the past. Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina on Tuesday became one of the first prominent Republicans to call for DHS Secretary Kristi Noem to step down. Noem "has proven to be way out of her depth", Tillis told reporters, adding that her leadership in Minnesota "should be disqualifying." The White House has said Trump has confidence in Noem. Facing 'serious, unanswered questions' Moderate Republicans like Murkowski aren't the only ones in the party criticising the immigration operation in Minnesota. In recent days some of Trump's allies in Congress also began speaking out against the shootings, though most issued carefully worded statements that didn't explicitly mention the president. "There are serious unanswered questions about federal use of force in Minnesota. Transparency and accountability are essential," said Representative Max Miller of Ohio, a former Trump adviser. Representative Andrew Garbarino of New York, the chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, called on the heads of ICE and other agencies to testify before Congress. Garbarino also came out in support of a full investigation into Pretti's shooting. "Congress has an important responsibility to ensure the safety of law enforcement and the people they serve and protect," Garbarino said. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas issued a more direct criticism of the administration after the Pretti shooting. But he focused on the administration's rhetoric in response to the shooting and didn't break with Trump's larger agenda. "What I think the administration could do better is the tone with which they're describing this - that immediately when an incident like this happens, they come out guns blazing that we took out a violent terrorist, hooray," Cruz said Monday on his podcast, Verdict with Ted Cruz. The Republican response is also complicated by the gun ownership debate that has pitted the administration against the National Rifle Association (NRA), a traditional ally of the political right. A Trump-appointed federal prosecutor in Los Angeles said in a social media post after Pretti's death that people who approach law enforcement officials armed should expect that there is a "high likelihood" they would get shot. The NRA slammed the remarks. "Responsible public voices should be awaiting a full investigation, not making generalisations and demonising law-abiding citizens," it said in a statement. Some Republican lawmakers defend immigration enforcement under way in Minneapolis and other US cities. Trump's immigration policies remain popular with the party's base, and after the recent shootings in Minneapolis, some Republican voters in the state told the BBC they didn't think the president should do anything differently. "They're just doing their job, which is right," Jay Cielinski, said of ICE in an interview Tuesday in his hometown of Zimmerman, a roughly 50-minute drive north of Minneapolis. The 59-year-old home inspector and self-described Trump supporter also said protesters, and state and local officials shouldn't interfere with federal immigration operations. That view is echoed by many Republicans, including Trump and other senior administration officials. "They should stay at home, stay out of the way," Cielinski said of people who protest against federal immigration operations. "Law enforcement officials at the city, state, county [levels] should be encouraging ICE to go in. They should expose the people that are illegal." Still, the cautious rebukes from Cruz and other prominent Republicans in Washington signalled an attempt to hold the administration accountable without alienating supporters like Cielinski. Pivoting to a softer approach The growing criticisms from Republican lawmakers came as Trump shifted his own tone in recent days, after more facts emerged about the circumstances surrounding Pretti's death. After the shooting Trump initially called Pretti a "gunman," and other senior US officials claimed the 37-year-old ICU nurse had turned up armed at an enforcement action to try and kill federal agents. But others have disputed that, saying Pretti was filming ICE agents with his phone then helping a woman pushed on the ground - and that video shows that he had a phone in his hand, not a weapon, when he was shot. Trump has since softened his rhetoric, and taken steps to try and ease tensions in Minneapolis. This week, he sent White House border tsar Tom Homan to take over the operation there, known as Operation Metro Surge. Homan's arrival represented a shakeup in leadership, as top Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino was expected to leave the city. Trump suggested on Tuesday that sending Homan to Minneapolis was intended to bring calm there. "We're going to de-escalate a little bit," Trump said in a Fox News interview. The president also held calls on Monday with Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, both of whom are Democrats. Frey said afterwards that Trump told him the "present situation" in Minneapolis can't continue. White House officials pulled back their rhetoric, too. "Nobody in the White House, including President Trump, wants to see people getting hurt or killed in America's streets," White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Monday. "It is President Trump's hope and wish and demand for the resistance and chaos to end today." The remarks appear to have opened the doors for more Republicans to voice concern about the shootings. But the party's future approach to its immigration messaging remains to be seen - both in the run-up to the midterms later this year and in the aftermath of the violence in Minneapolis. Already, there are signs of a government shutdown battle over immigration policy that could push lawmakers into their partisan camps. Senate Democrats vowed to block a spending package if it includes additional funding for DHS, setting the stage for a possible government shutdown later this week. The fight could pressure Trump's party to defend his immigration agenda and overshadow Republican calls for investigations into the shootings in Minneapolis. Republicans also will likely continue taking their cues from Trump. How he responds will shape the debate in the days and weeks ahead.

**Excerpt**

Who is Tom Homan, Trump's 'border tsar' deployed to Minneapolis? US President Donald Trump has deployed his "border tsar" Tom Homan to lead on-the-ground immigration enforcement in Minneapolis, after two US citizens were shot dead by federal agents in the city in less than a month. The White House has said Homan, who arrived in Minneapolis on Tuesday, will now be the "main point of contact on the ground" and will meet with city officials. It comes as Gregory Bovino, the US border patrol chief and public face of the Trump administration's mass deportation drive in cities across the US, is expected to leave the city along with some of his agents. Homan, 64, is seen both as a key Trump ally and someone with decades of experience in immigration policy across both Republican and Democratic administrations. He is also one of the most vocal defenders of Trump's immigration policy and mass deportation drive. A native of upstate New York, Homan began his career in law enforcement as a police officer before joining border patrol in 1984 in southern California. He joined what was then called the Immigration and Naturalization Service four years later, climbing through the ranks of US immigration enforcement over multiple years. By 2013 - under the Obama administration - he held a little-known but influential post heading the Enforcement and Removal Operations arm of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) Homan had planned to retire in 2017, just days before Trump's first administration began. An abrupt call at his retirement party from incoming Chief of Staff John Kelly changed those plans. "I remember him saying, I know it was bad timing, but the president-elect wanted me to stay and run [ICE]," Homan recalled in an interview last year with the Daily Caller. "Monday morning, I called [Kelly] and said I want to come back." A similar call, this time from current Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, again brought him out of retirement in 2024 ahead of the second administration. While "border tsar" is an informal term and position, it refers to an executive-branch role overseeing border and immigration policy across multiple agencies. It is not Senate confirmed, and is a policy position directly appointed by the serving president. So far in Trump's second term, Homan has been a vocal defender of the president's broad deportation goals, vowing to target the "worst of the worst" and challenge the notion that "those who enforce the law are the bad guys and those who break the law are the victims". But in practice, enforcing immigration laws and attempting to focus on public safety threats has also ensnared other undocumented migrants who have no criminal background - a fact that Homan acknowledges and blames on "sanctuary cities" that do not work with federal immigration efforts. Officials have said the act of being in the US illegally is a crime in itself. "We're not going to instruct ICE not to arrest [someone] unless there's a serious crime," he told reporters in July at the White House, where he makes regular appearances. "What message does that send the whole world? Go ahead and enter the country," Homan added. In September, the White House swiftly came to Homan's defence after reports emerged that he was accused in a bribery case that was ultimately dropped by the justice department when Trump returned to office. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt described that case - which allegedly saw Homan accept $50,000 (£36,3000) from undercover agents - as an effort to "entrap" a key Trump ally. Who is Greg Bovino and why is he being replaced? Unlike Homan, Bovino has spent almost his entire law enforcement career in border cities, having first joined Border Patrol in 1996 and serving in a variety of US domestic postings as well as overseas in Honduras and Africa. The North Carolina native rose to prominence in Trump's second term, taking the lead during immigration crackdowns in Los Angeles, Chicago, New Orleans and Minneapolis. Bovino has been serving as "commander-at-large" in Border Patrol - an informal role outside of the organisation's formal hierarchy. Border Patrol is one of several immigration-centred agencies that operates under the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Bovino reportedly answers directly to DHS head Kristi Noem. In his informal role, he works alongside officials like the Chief of Border Patrol, a position held by Michael Banks, and the Customs and Border Protection commissioner, a position currently held by Rodney Scott. Bovino's tactics have been both controversial, particularly the aggressive "turn and burn" method of making swift arrests before protesters can arrive to an area. "We're going to turn and burn to that next target and the next and the next and the next," he told the AP of the tactic. "We're not going to stop." Bovino has also earned a reputation as an official willing to clash with lawmakers. In recent days, for example, Bovino has publicly sparred with lawmakers from both parties who expressed concern about his operations in Minneapolis. Will leadership switch mean change in Minneapolis? Bovino being replaced with Homan in Minneapolis is seen by some political observers as recognition from the White House that an urgent change was needed amid growing public concern. In practice, however, that change is ultimately unlikely to alter the administration's approach to immigration enforcement. "Homan has more years at ICE and doing interior enforcement," former DHS immigration official Lora Ries told the BBC of his work in many American cities not near the border. "This isn't a surprise to me." Ries, now head of the border security and immigration centre at the conservative-leaning Heritage Foundation in Washington, added that while Homan has said he's sought to focus "on the worst, first", all deportable undocumented migrants will continue to be "on the table". For immigration activists, Homan's career - which has included staunch defence of Trump's family separation policy, which led to separating children from parents who are in the country illegally - also means that they see little practical difference between him and Bovino. "I'm not sure it means much. Homan is a career deportation advocate, and the architect of family separation," said Michael Lukens, the executive director of the Amica Center, an organisation which helps immigrants with legal access and services. "I think the difference is that he is more polished than Bovino. He is better at speaking to the press, and stakeholders," he added. "He's better for what they need, someone to paint their actions as not what they are." "This is much more about whether the White House sees this as a political issue, not a human one," Lukens added. "But there is no world in which Homan is a moderate."
