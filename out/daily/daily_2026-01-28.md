Trump warns Iran 'time is running out' as US military builds up in Gulf Donald Trump has warned Iran that "time is running out" to negotiate a deal on its nuclear programme following the steady build-up of US military forces in the Gulf. The US president said a "massive Armada" was "moving quickly, with great power, enthusiasm, and purpose" towards Iran in a post on his Truth Social platform. In response, Iran's mission to the UN said Tehran "stands ready for dialogue based on mutual respect and interests", but if pushed, it wrote in all capitals, it will defended itself and "respond like never before". Trump had previously said he would "rescue" protesters involved in the brutal and unprecedented crackdown on demonstrations in Iran earlier this month. The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) says it has confirmed the killing of nearly 6,000 people, including 5,633 protesters, since the unrest began at the end of December. It says it is also currently investigating another 17,000 reported deaths received despite an internet shutdown after nearly three weeks. Another group, the Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR), has warned that the final toll could exceed 25,000. "Hopefully Iran will quickly 'Come to the Table' and negotiate a fair and equitable deal - NO NUCLEAR WEAPONS," Trump wrote. Iran insists its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful and has repeatedly denied seeking to develop nuclear weapons. The US president said the naval force in the Gulf was larger than one sent to Venezuela before US forces seized the country's former leader Nicolás Maduro. Trump added that this force was "ready, willing, and able to rapidly fulfil its mission, with speed and violence, if necessary". Referring to the US strikes on key Iranian nuclear sites - launched during Israel's 12-day war with Israel last year - Trump warned: "The next attack will be far worse! Don't make that happen again." Earlier on Wednesday, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said: "Conducting diplomacy through military threat cannot be effective or useful." "If they [the US] want negotiations to take shape, they must certainly set aside threats, excessive demands and raising illogical issues," he said in televised remarks, translated by the AFP news agency. Using open-source tools, BBC Verify has been able to track some of the US deployments to the area. A US defence official confirmed to BBC Verify that a naval "armada" led by the USS Abraham Lincoln had also arrived in the Middle East. In June 2025, US strikes targeted three uranium enrichment facilities in Iran: Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan. American officials then said the operation - codename "Midnight Hammer" - had significantly set back the prospect of Tehran building a nuclear weapon.

Amazon confirms 16,000 job cuts after accidental email US technology giant Amazon has confirmed it will cut 16,000 jobs - hours after it told staff about a new round of global redundancies in an email apparently sent in error. The email, which has been seen by the BBC, was sent late on Tuesday and refers to a swathe of employees in the US, Canada and Costa Rica having been laid off as part of an effort to "strengthen the company." The message was apparently shared by mistake, as it was quickly cancelled. Early on Wednesday, Amazon announced job reductions as part of a plan to "remove bureaucracy" at the firm. Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology at Amazon, said on Wednesday it was not planning to make "broad reductions every few months", referring to Amazon's announcement of 14,000 corporate job cuts in October. "While many teams finalized their organizational changes in October, other teams did not complete that work until now," she said. Amazon employs around 1.5 million people globally, with around 350,000 in corporate roles. Amazon has not said where the latest job losses will fall or which countries will be affected. Project Dawn On Tuesday, a draft email written by Colleen Aubrey, a senior vice president at Amazon Web Services (AWS), was included in a calendar invitation sent by an executive assistant to a number of Amazon workers. The title of the invitation was "Send project Dawn email," an apparent reference to Amazon's code name for the job cuts. While the email made clear that the cuts were happening at Amazon, employees had not yet been officially informed. "This is a continuation of the work we've been doing for more than a year to strengthen the company by reducing layers, increasing ownership, and removing bureaucracy, so that we can move faster for customers," the email said. "Changes like this are hard on everyone. These decisions are difficult and made thoughtfully as we position our organization and AWS for future success," it added. The job cuts had been expected by Amazon employees for weeks, according to a former employee who asked not be identified. The broad understanding among employees had been that bosses intended to cut a total of around 30,000 roles, added the former employee, who left the company as part of the cuts in October. The firm was expected to reach that number of job cuts with another major round of cuts this month, followed by further redundancies until the end of May. While laid-off workers were invited to reapply for open positions at Amazon, the number of such roles was limited. People who did not move to another role received severance pay based on how long they had worked at the company. 'Time to rethink' Since Amazon founder Jeff Bezos stood down as its chief executive four years ago, his successor Andy Jassy has led the company through several rounds of cuts. Jassy has also attempted to bring a more strict work culture to the firm. In-office work is now mandatory five-days a week, making Amazon one of the only major tech companies to require its employees to be in the office full-time. Amazon is also focused on reducing costs, even monitoring corporate mobile phone use by AWS employees, according to a report in Business Insider, in an effort to limit a long-standing $50 per month reimbursement. In an email Jassy sent to employees before the Thanksgiving holiday viewed by the BBC, the CEO said he was thankful for the "challenges at opportunities at work" as "the world is changing at a very rapid rate." Jassy called this era at Amazon "a time to rethink everything we've ever done." Earlier on Tuesday, the company announced it would close its roughly 70 remaining Amazon-branded grocery stores, Amazon Fresh and Amazon Go, and expand its Whole Foods Market business.

### 3. [Ecuador says ICE agent attempted to enter its Minneapolis consulate](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g40k40xndo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

Ecuador says ICE agent attempted to enter its Minneapolis consulate The government of Ecuador has condemned what it described as an attempt by a US federal immigration agent to enter the Ecuadorean consulate in Minneapolis. The agent was prevented from gaining access by consular officials, who acted "to guarantee the protection of the Ecuadoreans who were inside the consulate at the time", a statement by Ecuador's foreign ministry said. Ecuador, whose president is an ally of Trump, has filed an official complaint. The incident comes at a time of high tension in the US city, just days after intensive care nurse Alex Pretti was shot dead by border agents during protests against the Trump administration's immigration crackdown in Minneapolis. Ecuador's foreign ministry said in a statement that an agent of the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) had "tried to enter the premises of the consulate" at 11:00 local time (17:00 GMT) on Tuesday. Under the 1963 Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, consular premises are considered "inviolable". According to the Convention, the authorities of the country where the consulate is located "shall not enter" the parts of the consulate used for work "except with the consent of the head of the consular post". Ecuador said that its officials had not consented to ICE entering the consulate. While the Vienna Convention goes on to say that consent may be assumed in certain cases, they are limited to incidents where "prompt protective action" is required, such as in the case of a fire or some other disaster. In a video shared by Ecuadorean media, which has not been independently verified by the BBC, a consular official can be seen rushing to the entrance door and telling an ICE agent "this is the consulate, you're not allowed in here". The agent tells the official that "if you touch me, I will grab you". The consular official then states again that "you can not enter here, this is a consulate, this is a foreign government's office", before closing the door. In its statement, Ecuador's foreign ministry said that it had "immediately" handed an official letter of protest to the US embassy in Quito. The protest letter constitutes a rare note of discord between Ecuadorean President Daniel Noboa and the Trump administration. Just over two months ago, the presidents agreed to strengthen their countries' commercial and economic relationship and Noboa has in the past thanked Trump for designating two Ecuadorean criminal gangs as Foreign Terrorist Organisations. The actions of immigration and border agents in Minneapolis - in particular the fatal shooting of Pretti on 24 January and that of Renee Good a few weeks earlier - have triggered protests in the city and beyond. On Tuesday, President Trump said he would "de-escalate" immigration and border operations "a little bit" in Minnesota. There are currently 3,000 immigration agents and officers in the region. Securing the US's borders and implementing tougher enforcement of immigration rules has been one of Trump's top priorities. According to a 20 January statement by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, her department removed "more than 675,000 illegal aliens" from the US since Trump was sworn in to a second term a year ago.

Grief and shock after Indian politician Ajit Pawar killed in plane crash India's prime minister has led tributes to Ajit Pawar, deputy chief minister of Maharashtra state, who has been killed in a plane crash in the west of the country. Pawar and four others died after the chartered plane they were travelling in crashed at the airport in Baramati - Pawar's constituency - on Wednesday morning. India's civil aviation minister said visibility was poor at the airport at the time of the crash. The aviation regulator has launched an investigation. Prime Minister Narendra Modi called Pawar's death "shocking and saddening" and praised his service to the people of Maharashtra. His funeral will be held on Thursday morning. Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis described his death as "an immeasurable loss" and announced three days of mourning in the state. Pawar was one of Maharashtra's most influential leaders, governing in coalition with India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The 66-year-old was affectionately called 'dada', a term for elder brother in the Marathi language, by party workers and the public. Sanjay Raut, from the state's opposition Shiv Sena (UBT) party, said Pawar's death was a "dark day". "Without Dada, the political landscape of Maharashtra is incomplete. He had an open-hearted personality and every party worker admired him," he said. Federal Home Minister Amit Shah, opposition leader Rahul Gandhi and others have also paid tribute. Who was Ajit Pawar? Ajit Pawar was a towering figure in Maharashtra's politics. For decades, he was a key member of the Nationalist Congress Party founded by his uncle, veteran politician Sharad Pawar. In his early years in politics, he focused on the grassroots and built networks with workers' unions and local co-operative banks. He was elected to the Maharashtra legislative assembly from Baramati for the first time in 1991 and would be re-elected from the same constituency several times, reflecting his strong connection with voters. Pawar also served as the state's deputy chief minister many times and headed key ministries within different governments, including agriculture and finance. But his last couple of years in politics were marked by turbulence and rebellion as he sought to move away from the shadow of his uncle and pursue his own political ambitions. In 2019, he made a dramatic move by breaking away from the NCP to join the state's ruling BJP government as the deputy chief minister. But lacking support from the NCP's cadre, the alliance collapsed and Pawar returned to his party within days. He was made deputy chief minister again when the NCP, Congress and Shiv Sena joined hands to form the government and played a key role in the coalition for the next three years. But tensions within the NCP continued to rise and in 2023, Pawar once again split from the party, this time with a large group of legislators, causing the NCP-Congress-Shiv Sena alliance to collapse. India's Election Commission would later recognise his faction as the official NCP. Pawar then helped form the state's new tri-party coalition government led by the BJP. He continued to serve as deputy chief minister but shared the post with another politician. In recent months, there were reports about a possible reconciliation between uncle and nephew, but neither of them officially confirmed this. How did his plane crash? Pawar was reportedly travelling to Baramati to address public meetings related to upcoming local elections when his plane crashed. India's aviation regulator has said that the aircraft he was travelling on was a Bombardier Learjet 45, which is a small business jet commonly used for charter flights and VIP travel in India. Pawar was accompanied by two staff members and two crew members who also died in the crash. "The aircraft was cleared for landing in Baramati on Wednesday morning after multiple attempts but, having finally received landing clearance, it did not give any "read-back" or response to the Air Traffic Control and moments later burst into flames on the edge of the runway", the federal aviation ministry said in a statement. How will Pawar's death affect Maharashtra's politics? Pawar's death will leave a vacuum in his party and also in Maharashtra's political landscape. He enjoyed huge support from his party members and was also loved by the public. Pawar was regarded as a shrewd administrator and skilled orator, and his witty remarks and fiery speeches made headlines and landed him in controversies many times. Over his decades-long career, he was accused of corruption, but he always denied the allegations against him. In the past decade or so, he had chartered a new trajectory for the NCP by embarking on surprising political alliances and managing to stay in power despite it taking a toll on his family. It's unclear who, or if anyone at all, will be able to fill Pawar's shoes in the NCP. Pawar's death will also have ramifications for the ruling alliance in Maharashtra as his party is left without its strongest leader. While the BJP-led ruling coalition has the numbers to run the government even without all of Ajit Pawar's lawmakers, any defection could lead to even more turbulence in Maharashtra's political landscape.

Trump says government will 'de-escalate' in Minnesota following Pretti shooting President Donald Trump has said his administration is "going to de-escalate a little bit" in Minnesota, after the second fatal shooting of a US citizen by federal immigration officers there. "Bottom line, it was terrible. Both of them were terrible," he said in a Fox News interview on Tuesday. Earlier this month, Renee Good was fatally shot by an immigration officer, followed by Alex Pretti, who was killed on Saturday after being stopped by border agents. Pretti's death reignited local protests and public outcry across the country, and led to criticism from lawmakers in both parties. Trump's remarks are the latest sign his administration is taking a step back on its operations in Minnesota. Speaking to other reporters ahead of a rally in Iowa Tuesday night, Trump said he viewed the killing of Pretti, an intensive care nurse at a veterans' hospital, as "a very unfortunate incident". Asked by reporters about whether he agreed with characterisations of Pretti as a "domestic terrorist," Trump said: "I haven't heard that." Trump then added: "He shouldn't have been carrying a gun." Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said shortly after the shooting that Pretti "wasn't there to peacefully protest, he was there to perpetuate violence," and accused him of "domestic terrorism". The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has also said the agents fired in self-defence, after Pretti resisted attempts to disarm him. Noem said Pretti was shot because he was "brandishing" a gun during a confrontation. Eyewitnesses and local officials, however, have challenged that account, saying he had a phone in his hand, not a weapon. There is no sign of a gun in Pretti's hand, according to analysis of the available video by BBC Verify. Local authorities said the gun had been legally registered and that Pretti had been shot after the firearm was removed. A preliminary report drafted by Customs and Border Protection also appears to contradict the initial DHS account of events. It says two of its agents fired their weapons at Pretti. It does not mention that Pretti was reaching for his firearm, according to a copy of the report seen by the BBC's US partner, CBS News. On Monday, the DHS pulled the Minnesota mission's leader and figurehead, Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino, from the state. The department said it was deploying the White House's border tsar, Tom Homan, to take over there. Homan posted on social media on Tuesday that he had met Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, and local law enforcement officials. Pretti's death, coming two weeks after the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Good, enraged local residents and sparked fresh calls from state and city officials for the Trump administration to withdraw its 3,000 immigration agents and officers from the region. In the interview with Fox News, Trump appeared to defend the Minnesota operation, saying "we took thousands of hardened criminals" out of the state, "so they have good crime numbers." "That's all working out, we have Tom Homan there now," he said, before adding the administration would "de-escalate". Stephen Miller, a top White House aide working on the administration's deportation initiative, told CNN that the White House "provided clear guidance to DHS that the extra personnel that had been sent to Minnesota for force protection should be used for conducting fugitive operations to create a physical barrier between the arrest teams and the disruptors". "We are evaluating why the [US Customs and Border Patrol] team may not have been following that protocol," Miller said in his statement to CNN. Some Republican leaders and lawmakers have called for an investigation into Pretti's death, including Vermont Governor Phil Scott and US Senator Pete Ricketts of Nebraska. "The nation witnessed a horrifying situation this weekend," Ricketts wrote on X. While he reaffirmed his "support for funding ICE remains the same," Ricketts said he expected "a prioritized, transparent investigation into this incident". A federal judge has blocked DHS from destroying or altering evidence. In his speech at the Iowa rally on Tuesday night, which was dedicated to his economic policies, Trump did not discuss the current situation in Minnesota in depth, but talked about his immigration crackdown more broadly, citing a Harvard Harris poll from December that suggested 80% of Americans support his administration's efforts to deport illegal immigrants who have committed crimes.

Zelensky condemns Russian drone strike that killed five on passenger train Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has condemned as "terrorism" a Russian drone attack on a crowded passenger train that local officials say killed at least five people and injured several others. More than 200 people were on the train, officials said, when one of the carriages was hit by a drone and two other drones exploded nearby, in Ukraine's north-eastern Kharkiv region on Tuesday. Zelensky said 18 people were in the carriage at the time and there was no "military justification" in targeting civilians. Russia has not commented on the strike, but it has intensified drone and missile attacks on Ukraine's energy and transport infrastructure during the harshest winter in years. Elsewhere in Ukraine, the southern port city of Odesa was hit by dozens of drones and officials said three people were killed and dozens more wounded. Energy officials said a local facility had suffered "enormous damage" overnight into Tuesday and Odesa city chief Serhii Lysak said attacks had continued for a second night into Wednesday. Meanwhile, in the Kyiv region, a couple were killed and their four-year-old child was hurt when a residential block of flats was hit in a district close to the capital, police said. Millions of people across Ukraine have been left without heating, electricity and water after the Russian assaults. Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion in February 2022, and Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory. In a post on social media late on Tuesday, Zelensky wrote: "In any country, a drone strike on a civilian train would be considered in exactly the same way - purely as terrorism." Pictures and footage released by Ukraine's emergency services show at least one badly destroyed carriage still burning after the attack. Kharkiv's regional prosecutor's office said the train was struck near the Yazykove village. The office said the train was heading from the western border town of Chop to Barvinkove in the Kharkiv region via the regional capital Kharkiv. This line runs further east to the Donetsk region, and is used by local residents and Ukrainian soldiers travelling to and from leave, as well as their wives and girlfriends travelling east to see them. Officials in Odesa said Russia had launched more than 50 drones on the port overnight into Tuesday. Three bodies were found in the rubble after several floors of one residential building collapsed after the strike, and a number of other buildings were damaged. Russia's daily aerial assaults continue even though Ukraine-Russia talks last week held the latest round of talks aimed at ending the war. The talks that also involved US negotiators took place in the United Arab Emirates, and were hailed by all sides as constructive. However, key territorial issues remain unresolved, and further meetings are expected this weekend.

'I couldn't save them' - US mum's horror as three sons die falling through pond ice Three young brothers have died in Bonham, north Texas, after falling through ice on a private pond on Monday. Cheyenne Hangaman, the boys' mother, said she tried to rescue them by lifting them out of the water and placing them on the ice, but it kept breaking. "There was three of them and only one of me... that's why I couldn't save them," she told CBS News, the BBC's US partner. She described her sons, aged six, eight and nine, as full of personality and urged families to "make sure that you hold your kids tight, always tell them that you love them". This story contains graphic content that some readers may find distressing. Hangaman, a mother of six, first learned of the accident when her daughter ran over to her, shouting that the boys had fallen in. The children had been out playing near the pond, about 100ft (30m) away from the house where the family had been staying. The youngest fell through first after trying to "ice skate" on the layer of ice on the water, Hangaman said, adding that the two older boys then jumped in after him. "When I seen them, they were struggling, and I know their bodies were already in shock," she said. "The water was freezing cold." While trying to save them, she began to struggle and was rescued by a neighbour. "I tried to fight for my kids' life, where I had to watch them struggle and drown and I couldn't help them," she said. The neighbour, a football coach at the school the boys attended, heard her screams and was able to pull her out of the water. "He said he heard the screaming or the call for help and came running. My friend had a horse rope, and he pulled me out with it," Hangaman said. In a statement, the local sheriff's office said the two older boys were pulled out of the water first by emergency workers and a neighbour, and taken to a local hospital. The six-year-old was later recovered after "an extensive search of the pond", the office added. Authorities did not release the children's names, but family members identified them as Howard Doss, six, Kaleb Doss, eight, and EJ Doss, nine. Describing her sons, Hangaman said EJ dreamed of becoming a football star, Kaleb loved to dance and sing, and the youngest, Howard, "liked making people laugh". The boys' school said they were "devastated by this unimaginable loss" in a letter to families seen by CBS News and that counsellors would be available to meet students and staff. Their deaths come as a deadly winter storm hit a wide swathe of the US, including Texas, over the last week, killing more than 20 people and leaving several thousands without power.

**Excerpt**

'We all know someone who was killed' - Iran protesters tell BBC of brutal crackdown "My friends are all like me. We all know someone who was killed in the protests." For Parisa, a 29-year-old from Tehran, the crackdown by security forces in Iran earlier this month was unlike anything she had witnessed before. "In the most widespread previous protests, I didn't personally know a single person who had been killed," she said. Parisa said she knew at least 13 people who had been killed since protests over worsening economic conditions erupted in the capital on 28 December and then evolved into one of the deadliest periods of anti-government unrest in the history of the Islamic Republic. With one human rights group reporting that the number of people confirmed killed has passed 6,000, several young Iranians able speak to the BBC in recent days - despite a near-total internet shutdown - have described the personal toll. Their names have been changed for safety reasons. Parisa said one 26-year-old woman she knew was killed by "a hail of bullets in the street" when the protests escalated across the country on Thursday, 8 January, and Friday, 9 January, and authorities responded with lethal force to crush them. She herself took part in protests in the north of Tehran that Thursday, which she insisted were peaceful. "No-one was violent and no-one clashed with the security forces. But on Friday night they still opened fire on the crowd," she said. "The smell of gunpowder and bullets filled the neighbourhoods where clashes were taking place." Mehdi, 24, who is also from Tehran, echoed her assessment of the scale of the protests and violence. "I had never seen anything even close to this level of turnout and such killings and violence by the security forces," he said. "Despite the killings on Thursday [8 January] and threats of more killings on Friday, people came out, because many of them could no longer endure it and had nothing left to lose," he added. Mehdi described witnessing multiple killings of protesters at close range by security forces. "I saw a young man killed right in front of my eyes with two live rounds," he said. "Motorcyclists shot a young man in the face with a shotgun. He fell on the spot and never got back up." The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (Hrana) says it has so far confirmed the killing of at least 6,159 people since the unrest began, including 5,804 protesters, 92 children and 214 people affiliated with the government. It is also investigating 17,000 more reported deaths. Skylar Thompson, from Hrana, told the BBC the confirmed number of dead was very likely to rise. "We are really committed to ensuring that every single piece of verified information that we report on sits next to a name and a location," she added. Another group, Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR), has warned that the final toll could exceed 25,000. Iranian authorities said last week that more than 3,100 people had been killed, but that the majority were security personnel or bystanders attacked by "rioters". Most international news organisations, including the BBC, are barred from reporting inside Iran. But videos showing security forces firing live ammunition at crowds have been verified by the BBC. An Iranian woman who took part in the protests told BBC Newsnight she saw "people on the ground" and children killed in the crackdown. Parnia, 25, who lives in London, said she was "on the front line" with "hundreds" of protesters as demonstrations grew in the central city of Isfahan where she was visiting family earlier this month. "I saw people on the ground. I saw blood," she said, describing her attempt to seek refuge amid clouds of tear gas. After entering a lobby, she said she "saw so many people hurt by the pellets". "You could see children who were on the street and they got killed. Seven years old, eight years old." Sahar, a 27-year-old from the capital, said she knew seven people who had been killed. She described how the security forces' response to the unrest escalated rapidly on 8 January. During a protest that evening, Sahar and her friends sought refuge in a nearby house after tear gas was fired. "My friend stuck his head out of a window to see what was going on and they shot him in the neck," she said. Another friend was wounded by pellets and later bled to death after avoiding going to hospital out of fear of being detained, according to Sahar. Sahar said a third friend died while being detained by the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC). "They [officers] told his family to come to the IRGC intelligence office. After a few days they rang and said, 'Come and collect the body.'" On 9 January, Sahar said, live ammunition was fired openly and "without mercy" by uniformed security personnel. "They were pointing lasers at people, and locals were opening their car park doors for us to hide," she said. The communications blackout compounded the trauma. "Right now there's no news at all," Sahar said. "Without internet or phone lines we had no idea what was happening to anyone. We could barely get calls through just to get bits of news." Parham, 27, described widespread use of pellet guns by security forces in Tehran, particularly targeting protesters' faces and eyes. One of his friends, Sina, 23, was shot in the forehead and eye on 9 January. "We took him to a hospital, but the doctor could only give us a prescription and told us to leave as soon as possible," Parham said. At an eye hospital, he added, wounded protesters arrived constantly. "Every 10 minutes, it felt like they were bringing in someone else who had been hit by a pellet." A worker at the hospital's cafe said she had seen "70 people with eye injuries come in during a single shift", according to Parham. Sina - who still has pellets stuck behind one of his eyes and in his forehead - said they had been scared of being arrested at the first hospital because of the need to give their ID numbers, so they had gone to a private eye hospital. He said he was "lucky" compared to the others who he saw at the eye hospital, who had "pellets all over their faces and in both of their eyes". The BBC has seen a medical document in Sina's name that says "there is a 5mm metallic foreign body" behind his eye. The medical records of a number of other protesters with pellet-gun wounds have also been received and verified by the BBC. Protesters and activists have also described a pattern of refusal by the authorities to hand over the bodies of those killed to their families. Mehdi said his friend's cousin was killed and that the family was told by officials to either pay a large sum of money to receive his body or agree to him being recorded as a member of the security forces. "They said, 'Either pay 1 billion tomans [more than $7,000; £5,000] for us to hand over the body to the family, or you have to say he was a member of the Basij and was martyred for public security and against the riots.'" Navid, a 38-year-old from Isfahan, also said two close friends whose relatives were killed had received such an ultimatum. "They say you have to pay the equivalent of several thousand dollars or let us issue them a Basij card so they are counted among the security forces' dead," he cited his friends as saying. Human rights groups have warned that this practice has served both to punish protesters' families and obscure the true death toll.

Malaysia football officials quit over foreign-born players scandal The entire executive committee of the Football Association of Malaysia (FAM) have resigned amid a simmering scandal over foreign-born players in the national team. Fifa, the world football governing body, has accused FAM of doctoring citizenship documents so seven foreign-born athletes could play for Malaysia. The mass resignations would "ensure that any necessary reforms may be undertaken without distraction or perceived conflicts, and with a renewed basis of trust", FAM said in a statement on Wednesday. For days there had been speculation that FAM leaders would step down to prevent a takeover by a FIFA-nominated committee, local media reported. The resignations were meant to "safeguard the reputation and institutional interests of FAM" and avoid consequences that "could affect Malaysian football as a whole", FAM said. It added that until a new committee is appointed, FAM's operations will be managed by a small team led by its secretary-general with help from the Asian Football Confederation. The seven foreign-born players have been been fined by Fifa, which also temporarily suspended them from playing football. But that suspension was lifted this week by the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which is set to deliver a verdict on the fates of embattled athletes. What is the scandal about? After Malaysia's 4-0 victory over Vietnam in an Asian Cup qualifier last June, Fifa launched an investigation into the eligibility of seven foreign-born players on the Malaysian national team. They are: Spanish-born Gabriel Felipe Arrocha, Facundo Tomas Garces and Jon Irazabal Iraurgui, Argentinian-born Rodrigo Julian Holgado and Imanol Javier Machuca, Netherlands-born Hector Alejandro Hevel Serrano and Brazilian-born Joao Vitor Brandao Figueiredo. Fifa's "grandfather rule" allows foreign-born football players to represent countries that their biological parents or grandparents were born in. The rule aims to prevent national teams from simply importing foreign players to boost performance. But according to Fifa, FAM had forged birth certificates to make it look like the players' grandparents were born in Malaysian cities like Penang and Malacca. Fifa investigators said the grandparents' original birth certificates showed they had been born in countries like Argentina and Spain - all corresponding with the players' birthplaces. This "constitutes, pure and simple, a form of cheating", the football governing body said at the time. The Fifa disciplinary committee fined the players and suspended them for 12 months. It also ordered FAM to pay 350,000 Swiss francs ($440,000; £330,000). FAM said the discrepancies arose from an "administrative error" and maintained the players were "legitimate Malaysian citizens". But FAM's appeal was rejected by Fifa, which overturned the results of three of Malaysia's football matches - against Singapore, Palestine and Cape Verde - into 3-0 defeats. FIFA also vowed to launch a formal investigation into FAM and inform authorities in five countries of forgery offences. What's next? After losing its appeal against Fifa's decision, FAM took the case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, an independent body in charge of sports-related disputes. On Monday, the CAS lifted the suspension on the seven players, allowing them to participate in football activities until it issues a verdict on their eligibility. That verdict is expected in late February, a FAM official told local media. This means for now, the players can return to the pitch at their respective football clubs. On Tuesday, Spanish football club Deportivo Alaves announced that Facundo Garces has rejoined the team's training sessions. Photos shared by Malaysian football club Johor Darul Ta'zim also showed another three players - Joao Figueiredo, Hector Hevel Jon Irazabal - back at training. South East Asian countries in search of sporting success have launched recruitment drives for naturalised football players. Indonesia, for one, has welcomed a wave of Dutch-born footballers from the Indonesian diaspora. Since 2018 Malaysia has granted citizenship to 23 foreigners to play for the national team, home minister Saifuddin Nasution Ismail told parliament last October.
