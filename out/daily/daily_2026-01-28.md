'Don't take us to a hospital': Iran protesters treated in secret to avoid arrest "People helped us and we got into a car... I said, 'Don't take us to a hospital.'" Tara and her friend were attending a protest in the central Iranian city of Isfahan when security forces arrived on motorcycles and began shouting at the crowd. "My friend told an armed member of the security forces, 'Just don't shoot us,' and he immediately fired several shots at us. We fell to the ground. All our clothes were covered in blood," she said. They were bundled into a stranger's car, but Tara said they were too frightened to be taken to the hospital because of the risk of being arrested. "All the alleyways were full of security forces, so I asked a couple standing at their front door to let us in." They stayed at the couple's home until it was almost dawn and then managed to find a doctor they knew, who cleaned the birdshot wounds on their legs, according to Tara. She said a surgeon was later able to remove some of the birdshot at home but warned them: "They cannot all be removed and will remain in your bodies." All names in this article have been changed for their safety. Warning: This story contains details and images which some readers might find distressing. The full scale of the bloodshed resulting from the crackdown by security forces on the anti-government protests that swept across Iran this month is still not known because of an internet shutdown and a ban on reporting by most international news organisations. But the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) has said it has confirmed the killing of 6,301 people, including 5,925 protesters, 112 children, 50 bystanders and 214 affiliated with the government. It is also investigating reports of 17,091 more deaths. At least another 11,000 protesters were seriously wounded, according to HRANA. Some of them have told the BBC that they have avoided seeking treatment for their injuries at hospitals because they fear being arrested. That has left them reliant on doctors, nurses and other volunteers willing to risk their own safety by treating them secretly at their homes. Healthcare workers have also told the BBC that security forces are present in hospitals and that they are constantly monitoring patients' medical records to identify injured protesters. Nima, a surgeon in Tehran, said he witnessed many young people being injured in the streets on his way to work on 8 January, when authorities responded to the escalating protests with lethal force. "I put one of the wounded in the boot of my car to take him to hospital, as I was worried that we would get in trouble if we were stopped by the police," he told the BBC. Nima said armed officers stopped him but allowed him to go after seeing his hospital identification card. "For almost 96 hours straight - without interruption, without sleep, without even closing our eyes for a moment - we were operating. We were crying and operating. Nobody complained." "All our clothes and hospital gowns were covered in blood - our outer clothes, our underwear, everything was soaked in the blood of these young people." Nima described operating on one man who had been shot in the leg and face at a protest. "A bullet had entered through his chin, ripped through his mouth and exited through his upper jaw," he recalled. Nima also said many of the young people treated at his hospital suffered gunshot wounds to their vital organs and limbs that required amputation and left them with permanent disabilities. Iranian authorities have said more than 3,100 people have been killed during the unrest, but that majority were security personnel or bystanders attacked by "rioters". Health ministry spokesman Hossein Shokri was also quoted by the semi-official Tasnim news agency as saying that around 13,000 operations had been carried out during the unrest. "Fortunately, people trust the ministry of health and hospitals, and confidence that all injured individuals are treated impartially in medical centres has led around 3,000 people who had been treating themselves at home over the past six days to seek care at hospitals," he added. The head of the Farabi Eye Hospital in Tehran, Dr Qasem Fakhrai, told Isna, another semi-official news agency, that it had treated a total of 700 patients with severe eye injuries requiring emergency surgery as of 10 January, and referred almost 200 to other hospitals. He said almost all of the patients were admitted after 8 January. Saeed told the BBC that his friend's eyes were hit by birdshot fired by security forces during a protest in the central city of Arak. Local doctors told him to go to a specialist eye hospital in Tehran, he said. Upon arrival, nurses took protesters with eye injuries to operating theatres through the back by using staff lifts. According to Saeed's friend, around 200 people with eye injuries from different cities were being treated at that hospital. "He had two operations, but the surgeon did not charge him," Saeed said. A healthcare worker in Tehran also said that doctors were trying to avoid mentioning gunshot wounds in medical records because they were being constantly monitored by security forces. Sina took his brother to a hospital after he was shot in the legs during protests in Tehran. "It was like a battlefield hospital - there were so many wounded that there were no blankets or medical kits," Sina told the BBC. "When I asked a nurse for a blanket for my brother, she told me to bring one from home because there were too many injured and not enough supplies." Sina said they had no choice but to give their actual ID number in order to use their health insurance. "At any moment, the security forces could raid our home," he added. In smaller cities, the situation is believed to be even more dire. Reports received by the BBC said security forces had abducted patients from hospitals and that they had not been seen again. Human rights groups have also said that medics and others who have treated injured protesters are now themselves being targeted by security forces. Iran Human Rights (IHR) said last week its sources on the ground in Iran had reported the arrest of at least five doctors and a volunteer first responder. "Security agencies appear to be aiming to intimidate the public and obstruct treatment for injured protesters by arresting doctors and raiding makeshift medical shelters," the Norway-based organisation warned. And this week, sources close to Dr Alireza Golchini, a surgeon from the northern city of Qazvin, said he had been beaten up at his home by security forces when they arrested him for treating injured protesters. They added that he had been accused of "moharebeh" (enmity against God) - an offence that can carry the death penalty under Iranian law.

### 2. [China trip will bring benefits to UK, Starmer insists, ahead of Xi meeting](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gw47prew7o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

China trip will bring benefits to UK, Starmer insists, ahead of Xi meeting Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has arrived in China for a three-day visit - the first by a British prime minister in eight years. Sir Keir is seeking to strengthen trading and cultural ties between the two nations after years of acrimony. But he has faced criticism from opponents at home over the risk posed by China to the UK's national security and Xi Jinping's human rights record. The PM - who will meet President Xi on Thursday - said the trip will bring benefits to the UK and it was important to maintain a "strategic and consistent relationship" with the world's second largest economy. As he arrived at the airport in Beijing, Sir Keir was greeted by a delegation of Chinese government officials and presented with a bouquet of flowers. Union flags were seen flying in Beijing's Tiananmen Square. Addressing the 60 British business leaders accompanying him on the trip, the PM said: "On this delegation, you're making history. You're part of the change that we're bringing about. "We are resolute about being outward-looking, about taking opportunities, about building relationships...and always being absolutely focused on our national interest." For a UK prime minister, the politics of engaging with China is tricky. China has been accused of committing crimes against humanity against the Uyghur population and other mostly-Muslim ethnic groups in the north-western region of Xinjiang. There has also been criticism over the treatment of Jimmy Lai - the Hong Kong pro-democracy media tycoon – who is facing a life sentence in prison. In addition to China's human rights record, there are concerns about the scale of its espionage activities in the UK, with the head of MI5 recently warning that Chinese state operatives presented a daily national security threat. Sir Keir declined to be drawn on what he would seek to raise with Chinese leaders. "In the past, on all the trips I've done, I've always raised issues that need to be raised, but I don't want to get ahead of myself on the specifics until I've had the opportunity," he told reporters travelling with him. He added: "Part of the reason for engaging with China is so that issues where we disagree can be discussed, and the issues where we agree can be progressed, and so that's the approach." Sir Keir will be hoping his visit - the first by a UK prime minister since Theresa May in 2018 - will mend relations with China, while keeping US President Donald Trump on side. He has insisted the UK will not be forced to "choose between" China and the US, amid rising trade tensions between the two superpowers in recent years. The UK would maintain "close ties" with the US on business, security and defence, he said, but added that "sticking your head in the sand and ignoring China... wouldn't be sensible". The PM's visit has attracted fierce criticism from his political opponents in the UK, particularly after the government gave the go-ahead to controversial plans for a Chinese mega-embassy in London. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said she would not visit China "at this time" if she was prime minister. "We should be talking more to those countries who are aligned with our interests, not the country that is doing everything it can to undermine our economy," she told reporters. "I think that that is what the prime minister should be talking about and he needs to show strength, not approving a super-embassy which many people think is going to become a spy hub." She had earlier said she was "worried about what he's [Starmer] going to be doing when he gets to China". "He's probably going to give away the Isle of Wight before he comes back. Let's have an actual foreign policy, one that is rooted in realism and focusing on Britain's national interest," she added. Sir Keir also faced criticism from the Liberal Democrats in the House of Commons, where deputy prime minister David Lammy stood in for him at his weekly question time session. Lib Dem deputy leader Daisy Cooper said: "Whilst the Chinese regime still holds British citizen Jimmy Lai captive in prison, and whilst the Chinese regime continues to hunt down pro-democracy protesters on the streets of Britain with bounties on their heads, the British prime minister has gone cap in hand to China to ask for a trade deal on the promise of a super-embassy from which the Chinese regime will continue to spy on us."

Panic on crowded Ukraine train - passenger describes moment of Russian drone strike A Ukrainian soldier has described the moment a passenger train was targeted by Russian drones, killing five people. When a carriage on the train was hit in northeastern Ukraine, passengers threw themselves on the floor in panic and the military officer told them to get out immediately. Without his instruction, issued moments before the carriage burst into flames, many more passengers could have died. The officer, whose army call-sign is Omar, is part of Ukraine's 93rd brigade. He was among the passengers travelling on a route from Chop, on the border with Slovakia, to Barvinkove, the last stop before the front line in eastern Ukraine. The first of three Russian drones landed near the train, forcing it to come to a halt. "Then we heard the rumble of another drone, and then an explosion," Omar tells the BBC. "The blast was so strong that parts of the carriage shattered into splinters." As the commander of a drone unit, he quickly realised he and the other passengers had to get out as the train could get hit again. In all, 291 people were on the train at the time, officials say. "After the second hit, I understood that the drone operator was observing what kind of target it was hitting," Omar says, and a stationary train was an easy target. The carriage that suffered a direct hit quickly became engulfed in flames. "I am in the military and I am prepared for such attacks," says Omar. "But for others it was a shock to be so close to death." Many passengers evacuated the train in a state of deep distress, and videos from the scene show people screaming and crying as they move away from the smouldering wreck. It was too dangerous for such a large number of people to stay near the burning carriages, so he urged them to start moving towards a nearby motorway. He then went back to the train with some of the other passengers to check if anyone had been left behind. Inspecting the carriages, he saw a body and continued to look for survivors. Five people lost their lives in the attack. In the final carriage, Omar found a young woman with a baby. "She was very scared and had no idea what to do but thank God she was alive," he says. She barely had time to put on warm clothes, and screamed she needed to go back to the carriage to retrieve her suitcase and documents, the officer says. "I came here to bring my son," she told Omar as she was getting off the train. Later, Omar understood she had been travelling to the front line so that her soldier husband could see their child. The attack on the passenger train in Kharkiv region was condemned by President Volodymyr Zelensky as terrorism. It hit the heart of the railway system - a symbol of resilience in a country where the airspace has been closed since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022. Millions of Ukrainians rely on the 21,000km-long (13,000-mile) railway network to travel around the country and to cross the border into neighbouring countries, from which they can then catch flights. Although the railways have been targeted in the past, by and large Ukraine's Ukrzaliznytsia rail company has been able to keep people moving on its vast network - although escalating attacks on infrastructure and severe weather have led to increasingly long delays. Trains to the frontline city of Kramatorsk in the Donetsk region were eventually suspended last autumn, once the area became too dangerous due to sustained aerial Russian attacks. On Wednesday, flags flew at half-mast in railway stations across Ukraine. The daily minute of silence observed across the country was dedicated to the victims of the drone strike on the train. Hours after the attack had taken place, services were running again on the Barvinkove-Chop line.

Plane crashes in Colombia, killing all 15 on board A passenger plane has crashed in northern Colombia, killing all 15 people on board, the country's state-run airline Satena confirmed. In a statement, it said its aircraft - a Beechcraft 1900 - "suffered a fatal accident", but gave no further details. The wreckage has now been located in a mountainous area. The official passenger list includes lawmaker Diogenes Quintero Amaya and Carlos Salcedo, a candidate in upcoming congressional elections. Satena earlier said contact with the plane was lost 11 minutes before it had been scheduled to land in the city of Ocaña, near the Venezuelan border, at 12:05 local time (17:05 GMT) on Wednesday. According to the airline, Flight NSE 8849 took off from the city of Cúcuta, about 100km (62 miles) north-east from Ocaña, carrying 13 passengers and two crew members. A search operation was immediately launched in the mountainous area, and a hotline was set up for the relatives of those who were on the plane. Colombia's armed forces have been helping with the search effort in the area where the plane went missing, which has areas controlled by Colombia's ELN guerrilla group.

**Excerpt**

At least five killed after Storm Kristin hits Portugal At least five people have died after Storm Kristin tore through central and northern Portugal, causing flooding, landslides and widespread damage. The storm, which the government described as an "extreme climactic event", left schools shuttered, buildings damaged and travel severely disrupted. In the coastal city of Figueira da Foz, a Ferris wheel overturned and several vehicles were hit when part of a roof was torn from a building. Portugal has been hit by a succession of storms in recent days, including one over the weekend in which a man died after his car was swept away in floods. Heavy rain and wind gusts of up to 150km (95 miles) per hour caused more than 3,000 weather-related incidents across the country, civil protection authorities said. Several people were struck by falling trees or debris. The strongest winds were recorded at the Monte Real air base in Leiria, where gusts of 178km were recorded before the monitoring equipment was destroyed. Officials said the location was likely the storm's entry point to mainland Portugal. More than 850,000 people lost power on Wednesday, according to electricity distributor E-Redes. The civil protection agency (ANEPC) reported that three people had died in the central district of Leiria - one of the worst affected areas. In Leira, one person was hit by a metal sheet, and another was trapped in the structure of a house, according to officials. Local media said a man in Vila Franca de Xira died when a tree struck his car, local media said. There were also reports of a death in the Marinha Grande area. Transport across Portugal has been severely disrupted, with roads - including the main motorway connecting Lisbon to the north - and railways blocked by debris. Ten coastal areas were placed under a red weather warning on Wednesday due to dangerous sea conditions, with waves forecast to reach up to 14m (45ft,11in), according to the Portuguese Institute of the Sea and Atmosphere (IPMA). The PSP (Public Security Police) urged people in Coimbra and Leira to stay inside, while Portugal's Secretary of State for Civil Protection said the country remained on maximum alert. Prime Minister Luis Montenegro expressed condolences to the victims' families. He said authorities were assessing the damage and would take "whatever measures are necessary". Meanwhile, Leiria's mayor, Goncalo Lopes, urged the government to declare a state of emergency. "We have public spaces turned upside down," he told reporters. "It's something that will require a very large recovery effort in the coming months. The impact is similar to what a bomb could mean in our city, with massive destruction." After crossing Portugal, Storm Kristin moved east into Spain - bringing with it snow, rain and strong winds. The storm caused widespread disruption across the country, with schools, roads and train lines closed and hundreds of thousands without power. In Andalusia, emergency services reported some 2,000 weather-related incidents. Spain's national weather agency, AEMET, warned of very strong winds in some areas, with gusts expected to reach hurricane force. A red weather alert has been issued for parts of Almeria in the south-east due to the strength of the wind.

### 6. [Iran's internet is returning - but not for everyone](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz7y2ddgl23o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

Iran's internet is returning - but not for everyone Nearly three weeks into one of the most extreme internet shutdowns in history, some of Iran's 92 million citizens are beginning to get back online - but access appears to be tightly controlled. The country cut off internet access on 8 January, in what is widely seen as an attempt to stem the flow of information about a government crackdown on protesters. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said the internet was blocked in response to what he described as "terrorist operations". Now there is evidence that some internet access has returned - but independent analysis indicates much of the country is still effectively cut off from the outside world. Iran's reformist Shargh newspaper has reported that some officials had claimed mobile internet had been restored. However, it said many users still do not have full access and can only connect intermittently and for very limited periods, often after repeated attempts. Firms which monitor web traffic say there are signs of the internet being used inconsistently, raising questions about who is able to connect, and under what conditions. "What we're seeing isn't a return to normal," said Doug Madory, director of internet analysis at network intelligence firm Kentik. "Major platforms are being allowed and blocked at different times during the day." Independent internet monitoring group NetBlocks reported similar findings. Madory said the pattern could instead indicate authorities are testing a new system to block web traffic, with changes being made in real-time. Amir Rashidi, director of cyber security at the Miaan Group said this points to only a certain number of people, who have been approved by the government, being the only ones with access. Human rights organisations say this control over internet access has played a big role in limiting information about the crackdown on protesters. The Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) said as of 26 January it had confirmed the deaths of 5,925 protesters. It warned the final toll could be several times higher, with a further 17,091 reported deaths currently being reviewed. Intermittent connections Internet rights observers say the unrest may have given the authorities an opportunity to accelerate long-planned efforts to tighten control over the internet - measures which would likely have faced far stronger resistance under normal circumstances. According to sources cited by Shargh, internet access in Iran has effectively been divided into multiple levels - ranging from a complete shutdown to normal access - with current connectivity still far from a full restoration. According to sources cited by the newspaper, foreign messaging apps, including WhatsApp, will remain restricted. There are some local communication platforms accessible inside the country, although observers have raised security and privacy concerns about their use. However, in recent days some users have reported being able to connect intermittently to the outside world, using services such as Google Meet, Telegram, Facebook Messenger or FaceTime to contact family members. Rashidi said this may be because selectively granting access to certain parts of the internet can have the side effect of letting tools such as a virtual private network (VPN) function - even if briefly. VPNs are ways to securely connect devices online, which can be used to view content blocked because of your location. "As long as there is any ability to transmit even a single bit of data, it is possible to find ways to use VPNs," Rashidi said. But he said the evidence so far suggests the authorities are determined to prevent VPNs from operating and to keep control over who can connect. Financial cost After nearly three weeks of internet disruption, Iran's Minister of Communications Sattar Hashemi said on 26 January the daily losses caused by the shutdown amount to nearly five trillion tomans ($35m; £25m). Amid mounting economic pressure, authorities appear to have introduced tightly controlled forms of internet access for some businesses, which analysts say may be part of a plan to manage connectivity more selectively. Business figures told the BBC in some cities, members of the Chamber of Commerce are granted just 20 to 30 minutes of unfiltered internet access per day. Even then, they claim this is only under supervision and after completing multiple stages of identity verification. One member of the Tehran Chamber of Commerce, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the access was "fully rationed and strictly time-limited". They added if work was not completed within the allotted time, the entire verification process had to be repeated. The same source said some businesspeople had also been required to sign commitments not to send files related to the protests. They called the system "effectively paralysing and humiliating" given the number of people involved, and said it had generated widespread dissatisfaction among traders. Internet freedom observers at FilterWatch have previously warned the authorities are rapidly putting in place new systems and rules aimed at cutting Iran off from the international internet. And Madory said, looking at web traffic data, the patterns suggest a full restoration of internet access in Iran may never occur.

**Excerpt**

Europe must act urgently and stop outsourcing defence, says EU's Kallas Europe must step up urgently to improve its defence and make Nato "more European to maintain its strength", because the US has shaken the transatlantic relationship to its foundation, the EU's foreign policy chief has warned. The US would continue to be Europe's partner and ally, Kaja Kallas told a defence conference, but no great power had ever "outsourced its survival and survived". Tensions with the US flared when President Donald Trump threatened to take over Greenland, a semi-autonomous Danish territory. Kallas's remarks came after Nato leader Mark Rutte prompted a backlash when he said European lawmakers should "keep on dreaming" if they thought Europe could defend itself without the US. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot reacted to the secretary general's comments on Tuesday by saying: "No, dear Mark Rutte. Europeans can and must take control of their security. Even the United States agrees. It's the European pillar of Nato." Kaja Kallas said that under the Trump administration Europe was "no longer Washington's primary centre of gravity", and the continent needed to change the culture away from thinking as nations, and towards acting jointly as Europeans. Washington's transition away from Europe "has been ongoing for a while", the EU foreign policy chief said, adding that it was structural, not temporary. The 23 nations that were members of both the EU and Nato had a special responsibility to "sync our efforts, together with Nato". Like Barrot, she highlighted the importance of showing how a "distinct European pillar" would add value. The recent US-European rift over Greenland has highlighted the "tectonic shift" in the relationship that Kallas referred to in her speech, with Trump threatening to impose tariffs on some of his closest European allies after they opposed his plans to take over the Arctic island. Mark Rutte was credited last week with calming tensions between Trump and European leaders, when the US president dropped his threat during talks with the Nato chief on the fringes of Davos. Trump said he was exploring a potential deal on Greenland, although no details have yet emerged. Last year, under pressure from Trump, Nato member states promised to increase their overall spending to 5% of GDP by 2035, although part of that could go towards national infrastructure. Rutte told the European Parliament on Monday that if Europe really wanted to "go it alone" on defence it would have to spend 10% of economic output (GDP) and create its own nuclear capability. A move away from the US would, in Rutte's view, "lose the ultimate guarantor of our freedom, which is the US nuclear umbrella". Addressing the same conference in Brussels as Kaja Kallas, EU Defence Commissioner Andrius Kubilius said on Wednesday that the US now expected Europeans to take responsibility for their defence as the Americans were going to "diminish their presence on the continent". Europe was "a giant, but a sleeping giant" that needed waking up. "We must very rapidly build our independence. Independence in defence: without delays and without excuses," he added. Nato's primary purpose when it was founded in Washington in 1949 was to ensure the security and freedom of its members in the face of a hostile Soviet Union - a Russia-dominated Communist empire that collapsed in 1991. Russian President Vladimir Putin has long accused Nato of expanding eastwards, creating a security threat to Moscow, and he framed Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 as a response to that. However, an increasingly belligerent Russian state has prompted two more members of the EU - Sweden and Finland - to join the Nato alliance since the full-scale invasion. The Kremlin has demanded that under a future peace deal Ukraine must be barred from joining Nato. Although it is part of Ukraine's constitution to join the European Union and Nato, the chances of Kyiv becoming a Nato member any time soon are considered remote.

Deutsche Bank offices raided in money laundering probe Deutsche Bank's offices in Frankfurt and Berlin have been raided by officials as part of an inquiry into money laundering. In a statement, the Office of the Federal Prosecutor said it was conducting an investigation, involving the Federal Criminal Police Office, into "unknown individuals and employees" at Germany's largest bank. It said Deutsche Bank had "maintained business relationships in the past with foreign companies" which were suspected of "having been used for money laundering purposes as part of further investigations". A Deutsche Bank spokesperson confirmed to the BBC that searches had been carried out at its premises. Officials declined to comment on who, at the bank, or which foreign companies are being investigated. "No further information can be provided regarding the background of the business relationships, the transactions processed through Deutsche Bank AG, their scope, or the companies themselves," the prosecutor's office said. German media has reported that the case carries possible links to Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich. A legal representative for Abramovich told the BBC in a statement: "Our client is not aware of any investigations by the German authorities in this matter. "Mr Abramovich has always acted in accordance with applicable domestic and international laws and regulations. Any suggestion to the contrary is false and defamatory, and our client reserves all rights in this matter." Abramovich was sanctioned by the UK government and the European Union in March 2022, following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The oligarch, who made his fortune in oil and gas, is alleged to have strong ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, which he denies. Deutsche Bank is scheduled to publish its full-year results on Thursday, an announcement which will now be overshadowed by the raids. Its shares closed nearly 2% lower on Wednesday. It is not the first time the bank's offices have been searched. In 2018, its Frankfurt headquarters and five other offices in the city were raided in a money laundering operation involving about 170 police and officials. That investigation looked into whether Deutsche Bank staff helped clients set up offshore accounts to "transfer money from criminal activities", and was focused on activities between 2013 and the start of 2018.

'I don't let bullies win,' says US congresswoman Omar after substance thrown at her Minnesota congresswoman Ilhan Omar was attacked at an event she was hosting on Tuesday, when an audience member used a syringe to spray liquid at her, Minneapolis police said. Omar was uninjured and continued to speak. "I'm ok. I'm a survivor so this small agitator isn't going to intimidate me from doing my work. I don't let bullies win," she later wrote on X. Authorities have not yet identified what the liquid was. According to a BBC journalist in the room, it had a sour smell similar to a chemical product. Anthony James Kazmierczak, 55, has been charged with third-degree assault and is being held in custody, the local sheriff's office said. Omar, a Democrat who became in 2019 the first Somali-American to serve in the US Congress, is a fierce critic of US President Donald Trump. She has recently targeted the president's immigration crackdown in Minnesota, during which two US citizens have been shot dead. On Tuesday, responding to the second fatal shooting, Trump said his administration was "going to de-escalate a little bit". During her speaking event, Omar called for the abolition of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which is one of the main agencies tasked with carrying out the operation and has come under intense scrutiny for its tactics. Trump has frequently clashed with Minnesota's Democratic officials, and has often singled out Omar in particular for personal attacks. Prior to Tuesday's attack on the congresswoman, he told an audience in Iowa that immigrants to the US "have to show that they can love our country, be proud - not like Ilhan Omar". In the wake of the attack on Omar, the president was asked by ABC News whether he had seen the footage of the incident, and responded that he had not. "I don't think about her. I think she's a fraud," Trump told the outlet. During Tuesday's event, Omar said Trump's key ally Kristi Noem - whose Department of Homeland Security (DHS) oversees ICE - should "resign or face impeachment" over recent events in her state. In January, an immigration officer fatally shot US citizen Renee Good. And on Saturday, US citizen Alex Pretti was fatally shot after being stopped by border agents, reigniting local protests as well as a nationwide public outcry. It was after Omar's comments about Noem that she was attacked. As he was pushed out of the room following his use of the syringe, the attacker said that Omar was "pitting us against each other". It was not immediately clear what he was referring to. Kazmierczak was immediately arrested and forensics were being conducted at the scene, police said. Officials pleaded with Omar to end the event, but the congresswoman insisted that she would continue, telling her audience: "We will continue... we are Minnesota strong." When back at the lectern, she added: "We're gonna keep talking. Just give me 10 minutes. Please don't let them have the show." One attendee, Alfred Flowers Jr, told the BBC that he "respected her courage and strength to still stay and finish the town hall for the people". In a post on social media, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said: "Violence and intimidation have no place in Minneapolis. We can disagree without putting people at risk... This kind of behaviour will not be tolerated in our city." Omar regularly hosts such speaking events, known in the US as town halls. On Tuesday, about 100 people attended the gathering in the north Minneapolis basement. They were expecting to hear about the presence of federal immigration officials in their town and ask questions about the recent fatal shootings. In 2019, Omar became the first Somali-American, first African-born American, and one of the first two Muslim American women to serve in the US Congress. Trump's crackdown in Minneapolis was launched in December after some Somali immigrants were convicted in a massive fraud of state welfare programmes. The state is home to the largest community of Somali immigrants in the US. The president has regularly criticised the state's Democratic officials, not least Omar, whom he has called a "radical left lunatic" and "disgusting". Earlier this month, Trump wrote on Truth Social that Omar "should be in jail, or even a worse punishment, sent back to Somalia, considered one of the absolutely worst countries in the World. She could help to MAKE SOMALIA GREAT AGAIN!" On the same day as the attack on Omar, US Capitol Police - which investigates incidents such as this one - reported a 50% increase in threats last year to lawmakers from both political parties, their families, aides and Congress itself. The USCP said the number of threats it investigated had risen for the third year in a row, to 14,938. Additional reporting by Kristina Volk

### 10. [Amazon confirms 16,000 job cuts after accidental email](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2ywzxlxnlo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

Amazon confirms 16,000 job cuts after accidental email US technology giant Amazon has confirmed it will cut 16,000 jobs - hours after it told staff about a new round of global redundancies in an email apparently sent in error. The email, which has been seen by the BBC, was sent late on Tuesday and refers to a swathe of employees in the US, Canada and Costa Rica having been laid off as part of an effort to "strengthen the company." The message was apparently shared by mistake, as it was quickly cancelled. Early on Wednesday, Amazon announced job reductions as part of a plan to "remove bureaucracy" at the firm. Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology at Amazon, said on Wednesday it was not planning to make "broad reductions every few months", referring to Amazon's announcement of 14,000 corporate job cuts in October. "While many teams finalized their organizational changes in October, other teams did not complete that work until now," she said. Amazon employs around 1.5 million people globally, with around 350,000 in corporate roles. Amazon has not said where the latest job losses will fall or which countries will be affected. Project Dawn On Tuesday, a draft email written by Colleen Aubrey, a senior vice president at Amazon Web Services (AWS), was included in a calendar invitation sent by an executive assistant to a number of Amazon workers. The title of the invitation was "Send project Dawn email," an apparent reference to Amazon's code name for the job redundancies. While the email made clear that the cuts were happening at Amazon, employees had not yet been officially informed. "This is a continuation of the work we've been doing for more than a year to strengthen the company by reducing layers, increasing ownership, and removing bureaucracy, so that we can move faster for customers," the email said. "Changes like this are hard on everyone. These decisions are difficult and made thoughtfully as we position our organization and AWS for future success," it added. The lay-offs had been expected by Amazon employees for weeks, according to a former worker who asked not be identified. The broad understanding among staff had been that bosses intended to cut a total of around 30,000 roles, the former employee added, who left Amazon as part of a redundancy round in October. The firm was expected to reach that number of job cuts with another major set of lay-offs this month, followed by further redundancies until the end of May. While affected workers were invited to reapply for open positions at Amazon, the number of such roles was limited. People who did not move to another role received severance pay based on how long they had worked at the company. 'Time to rethink' Since Amazon founder Jeff Bezos stood down as its chief executive four years ago, his successor Andy Jassy has led the company through several rounds of cuts. Jassy has also attempted to bring a more strict work culture to the firm. In-office work is now mandatory five-days a week, making Amazon one of the only major tech companies to require its employees to be in the office full-time. Amazon is also focused on reducing costs, even monitoring corporate mobile phone use by AWS employees, according to a report in Business Insider, in an effort to limit a long-standing $50 per month reimbursement. In an email Jassy sent to employees before the Thanksgiving holiday viewed by the BBC, the chief executive said he was thankful for the "challenges at opportunities at work" as "the world is changing at a very rapid rate." Jassy called this era at Amazon "a time to rethink everything we've ever done." Earlier on Tuesday, the company announced it would close its roughly 70 remaining Amazon-branded grocery stores, Amazon Fresh and Amazon Go, and expand its Whole Foods Market business.

Ecuador says ICE agent attempted to enter its Minneapolis consulate The government of Ecuador has condemned what it described as an attempt by a US federal immigration agent to enter the Ecuadorean consulate in Minneapolis. The agent was prevented from gaining access by consular officials, who acted "to guarantee the protection of the Ecuadoreans who were inside the consulate at the time", a statement by Ecuador's foreign ministry said. Ecuador, whose president is an ally of Trump, has filed an official complaint. The incident comes at a time of high tension in the US city, just days after intensive care nurse Alex Pretti was shot dead by border agents during protests against the Trump administration's immigration crackdown in Minneapolis. Ecuador's foreign ministry said in a statement that an agent of the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) had "tried to enter the premises of the consulate" at 11:00 local time (17:00 GMT) on Tuesday. Under the 1963 Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, consular premises are considered "inviolable". According to the Convention, the authorities of the country where the consulate is located "shall not enter" the parts of the consulate used for work "except with the consent of the head of the consular post". Ecuador said that its officials had not consented to ICE entering the consulate. While the Vienna Convention goes on to say that consent may be assumed in certain cases, they are limited to incidents where "prompt protective action" is required, such as in the case of a fire or some other disaster. In a video shared by Ecuadorean media, which has not been independently verified by the BBC, a consular official can be seen rushing to the entrance door and telling an ICE agent "this is the consulate, you're not allowed in here". The agent tells the official that "if you touch me, I will grab you". The consular official then states again that "you can not enter here, this is a consulate, this is a foreign government's office", before closing the door. In its statement, Ecuador's foreign ministry said that it had "immediately" handed an official letter of protest to the US embassy in Quito. The protest letter constitutes a rare note of discord between Ecuadorean President Daniel Noboa and the Trump administration. Just over two months ago, the presidents agreed to strengthen their countries' commercial and economic relationship and Noboa has in the past thanked Trump for designating two Ecuadorean criminal gangs as Foreign Terrorist Organisations. The actions of immigration and border agents in Minneapolis - in particular the fatal shooting of Pretti on 24 January and that of Renee Good a few weeks earlier - have triggered protests in the city and beyond. On Tuesday, President Trump said he would "de-escalate" immigration and border operations "a little bit" in Minnesota. There are currently 3,000 immigration agents and officers in the region. Securing the US's borders and implementing tougher enforcement of immigration rules has been one of Trump's top priorities. According to a 20 January statement by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, her department removed "more than 675,000 illegal aliens" from the US since Trump was sworn in to a second term a year ago.

**Excerpt**

Man guilty of assault after Barron Trump reported attack to UK police A Russian man has been found guilty of assault occasioning actual bodily harm after Donald Trump's son told UK police he had seen a woman being beaten up on a video call. Barron Trump, 19, contacted officers when he was in the US to say his friend had been attacked by Matvei Rumiantsev in London in January 2025, a trial at Snaresbrook Crown Court heard. Prosecutors said Rumiantsev, 22, had been jealous of the woman's friendship with Trump. Rumiantsev, who lived in Canary Wharf, east London, was also convicted of perverting the course of justice. He was found not guilty of one count of rape and intentional strangulation, and another of rape and assault alleged to have occurred in November 2024. The trial had heard that Trump called the victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, on 18 January last year and contacted UK police shortly afterwards. "I'm calling from the US, uh I just got a call from a girl, you know, she's getting beat up," he said, according to a transcript of the call released by the Crown Prosecution Service. Asked by the operator how he knew the woman, Trump said: "I don't think these details matter, she's getting beat up but OK fine, also I met her on social media, I don't think that matters." The operator responded: "Can you stop being rude and actually answer my questions?" A few months later, in May 2025, Trump told police in an email that what he saw had been "very brief indeed but indeed prevalent". The 19-year-old said his video call to the woman had been picked up by "a shirtless man with darkish hair". This view lasted "maybe one second" before the camera flipped to "the victim getting hit while crying", he told police, adding: "This whole interaction had lasted five to seven seconds." Jurors heard that Rumiantsev and the woman had been drinking together on the evening of 17 January and into the next morning. The prosecution said he assaulted the woman on 18 January 2025, including hitting her in the face. Judge Mr Justice Bennathan KC had cautioned the jury not to rely on Trump's account as the main basis for a conviction, noting he had not given evidence under oath or been cross-examined. Prosecutor Serena Gates said Rumiantsev had been jealous of the woman's friendship with Trump, perhaps because of his "public profile". Asked during cross-examination whether he was jealous of men the victim might speak to, Rumiantsev said: "What I was really unhappy about was that she was frankly leading him [Trump] on." Mr Justice Bennathan KC told Rumiantsev the trial was about whether he "attacked her or not". Rumiantsev responded: "I am being portrayed as a jealous person who can lose his temper due to jealousy. I want to just make clear that her actions towards him was wrong and it was not fair." He added: "I was jealous to some extent." The conviction for perverting the court of justice relates to a letter Rumiantsev wrote to the woman from prison after the 18 January attack, asking her to withdraw her allegations.

**Excerpt**

US YouTube star IShowSpeed to get Ghanaian passport as Africa tour ends IShowSpeed, one of the world's most popular content creators, is set to receive a Ghanaian passport following his highly anticipated trip to the West African nation. Ghana was the penultimate stop on the US influencer's live-streamed, 20-country tour of Africa, which wrapped up on Tuesday. Following IShowSpeed's visit, Ghana's foreign minister announced that his office had approved a passport for the YouTuber, who he called a "worthy ambassador". The "Speed Does Africa" tour has been watched around the world, with many praising it for helping to break stereotypes about the continent and showcasing numerous African cultures to the world. IShowSpeed, aged 21, whose real name is Darren Watkins Jr, has more than 50 million YouTube subscribers, with his Africa tour contributing to the growth of his platform. His Ghanaian passport was approved following "confirmation of the irrefutable ties of IShowSpeed to Ghana", Foreign Minister Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa posted on social media. While streaming in Ghana, the YouTuber told his audience that his mother was from the West African country. In his post, Ablakwa urged IShowSpeed to "keep making our great nation Ghana, and our beloved African continent proud". "Ghana celebrates you", he added. Many Ghanaians responded positively to Ablakwa's announcement, but some accused the government of "devaluing" the country's passport by handing them to foreign celebrities. In recent years, Ghana has sought to promote itself throughout Africa's huge global diaspora. In 2024, the country offered Ghanaian citizenship to over 500 members of the diaspora. The recipients were mostly African-Americans, like the legendary US singer Stevie Wonder. Other West African countries have also offered nationality to the descendants of those who were taken to the Americas during the slave trade. During his visit to Ghana on Monday, IShowSpeed said he felt as though he was "back home," and spent the day visiting iconic locations in the country. He travelled to Ghana's eastern region, where he took part in a traditional naming ceremony. Wearing the famous local kente cloth, he was given the name Barima Kofi Akuffo. During his 28-day tour of Africa, IShowSpeed visited countries including Nigeria, South Africa, Morocco and Ivory Coast. He participated in various crowd-pulling activities, including racing a cheetah and dancing with members of the Masaai ethnic group. IShowSpeed celebrated his 21st birthday with cake in Lagos, Nigeria's largest city. Rolling Stone magazine named him the "most influential creator of 2025" and Forbes estimates his net worth to be $20m (£14.5m).

**Excerpt**

South Korea's ex-first lady jailed for 20 months for bribery The wife of South Korea's ousted former president has been sentenced to 20 months in jail for accepting bribes from the controversial Unification Church. However, the court cleared 52-year-old Kim Keon Hee on charges of stock price manipulation and receiving free opinion polls from a political broker before the 2022 presidential election, which her husband Yoon Suk Yeol won. Yoon has already been sentenced to five years' in jail for abusing power and obstructing justice in relation to his failed martial law bid in 2024. This marks the first time in South Korea's history that a former presidential couple are convicted at the same time. On Wednesday, Judge Woo In-sung at the Seoul Central District Court ruled that Kim had "misused her position as a means of pursuing personal gain". "The higher [one's] position, the more consciously one must guard against such conduct... The defendant failed to reject solicitations and was preoccupied with self-adornment," the judge said. In a statement after the verdict, Kim said: "I humbly accept the court's sterm admonition and will not take its weight lightly". "Once again, I sincerely apologise to everyone for the concern I have caused," she added. Kim had previously denied all charges. A special counsel team appointed to the case said Kim received 80m won ($56,000; £40,600) of gifts, which include a Graff diamond necklace and several Chanel handbags, from the Unification Church between April and July 2022, in exchange for business and political favours. The team had sought a 15-year jail term and a fine of 2bn won for all three charges heard on Wednesday - for which Kim was convicted of one - but the judge noted that Kim was not the one who demanded or solicited the bribes, and that she had "no significant criminal record". She was however ordered to pay back 12.85m won in cash and the court also ordered the confiscation of the diamond necklace. Kim has also been charged over her alleged involvement in a scheme to recruit Unification Church followers to the conservative People Power Party that her husband was part of, and accepting gifts in exchange for government job appointments. The court has yet to hear those cases. The former first lady had denied all charges, saying they were "deeply unjust", although she did admit to receiving Chanel bags, which she said she later returned without using. She made a public apology when she appeared for questioning last August. "I am truly sorry that a nobody like me has caused concern to the people," she said. Investigations into Kim's dealings with the Unification Church had also led to the arrest of church leader Han Hak-ja. Apart from the criminal allegations, Kim has also been the subject of other controversies. Last year, Sookmyung Women's University annulled an art education degree she graduated with in 1999, after an ethics panel found she had plagiarised her master's thesis.

**Excerpt**

During heated hearing, Rubio insists US action in Venezuela will lead to prosperity and security Many members of Senate Foreign Affairs committee have wanted an opportunity to question the US Secretary of State on Venezuela for some time. They have called for a hearing since well before the unprecedented US airstrikes on Caracas and the removal of Nicolás Maduro from power in the early hours of 3 January. Wednesday, their wish was fulfilled. "Finally, a public hearing," said Tim Kaine of Viriginia, a Democrat, before launching into a recap of how the Trump Administration had reached this point on Venezuela, where Maduro is now in a US jail and the country is being led by Interim President Delcy Rodriguez. Kaine pointed out that the first US strike on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean took place on 2 September 2025 – some five months ago – and lamented the fact that the discussions about the legality of those strikes had been classified and took place behind closed doors. However, this hearing was primarily about the events of this year – when Delta Force troops forcibly removed Maduro from Venezuelan soil in his pyjamas to face drug trafficking charges in New York. Secretary Rubio was careful to stress that the US was not at war with Venezuela, saying in his written opening statement for the hearing: "We did not occupy a country. There are no US troops on the ground." It was a key point for him to register in the face of arguments that the Trump administration has circumvented Congress, which under the US Constitution has the sole power to declare war, and ignored the 1973 War Powers Act. Instead, Rubio, a former US Senator, repeatedly characterised the US military action in Caracas as a "law enforcement operation". A "drug bust", retorted Senator Rand Paul, a Republican who has argued the justifications for military action were lacking. But as the Trump administration's critics questioned the logic, wisdom and the legal basis of its decisions on Venezuela, Rubio remained robustly on message. He was, as expected, thoroughly unapologetic over the military action and removal of Maduro from power. Maduro was an indicted drug criminal, he said, and not the legitimate president of Venezuela. Furthermore, it was impossible to make a deal with the man as "he couldn't be trusted" having strung along negotiators and diplomats so often in the past, Rubio added. "The glue that held the regime together was corruption and graft," Rubio said at one point. "His removal has created the conditions to begin to move away from that." Rubio insisted the Trump administration's actions would eventually improve the situation in Venezuela – which he likened to a "critically ill patient" – and make the region safer and more prosperous. The secretary also laid out the administration's plan for Washington to maintain full control over Venezuela's oil industry. The funds from sales of Venezuelan crude were being held, at least initially, in an offshore account in Qatar but would eventually be transferred to "a US Treasury blocked account in the United States". The Venezuelan government would have to request the use of those funds for a set of narrowly defined needs and Washington would decide on releasing them, he said. The upshot, according to Rubio, would be Venezuelan oil profits being spent on US-made goods, from basic foodstuffs to chemicals for oil refineries, rather than in Russia or to service debt to China. Analysts continue to wonder how government figures in Caracas, all of whom have made a career through vocal anti-Americanism, will receive such intervention in Venezuela's oil wealth Rubio, however, refused to take the further use of military force in Venezuela off the table. "We don't want that and we hope we don't have to use it," he repeated. But undoubtedly, the action against Maduro has served as a stark warning to others in Venezuela's government and armed forces that they could face a similar fate should they step out of line. The ultimate goal of Washington's energy plan, said Rubio, was to eventually transfer the control of the oil-rich nation's natural resources back to Venezuela under a stable democratic government. It was the roadmap to that destination which most concerned a number of Secretary Rubio's critics in the hearing room. Still, Rubio exuded confidence when talking about Latin America, one of his strongest area of expertise. Rubio chaired the committee he was facing for many years, and also led its subcommittee on the region. "We are not even four weeks into this thing," he responded to a question about how success could be defined and measured. Already things were moving in "the right direction", he insisted. A hydrocarbons law passed under Maduro's political mentor, Hugo Chavez, had been redrafted to allow greater private investment from US energy companies and Rodriguez was proving to be a willing partner – so far. "Four, five or six months from now cannot look like now," he conceded but cited the examples of Spain and Paraguay's 20th Century transitions to democracy. Rodriguez as the country's leader and an energy policy devised and executed by Washington were both immediate necessities, he argued, not long-term strategies. Eyes across the region will have been fixed on Rubio's appearance on Capitol Hill -- particularly in Venezuela itself and its long-standing communist-run ally, Cuba. One statement from Rubio, a Florida-born Cuban American with a deep enmity towards the Cuban Government, will have worried authorities in Havana above all. Rodriguez "has pledged to end Venezuela's oil lifeline to the Cuban regime", he said in his prepared remarks, and she is "well aware of the fate of Maduro; it is our belief that her own self-interest aligns with advancing our key objectives." The coming months will reveal whether that belief is well placed. But either way, the US government's vision as set out by Rubio involves nothing less than transformative change in Venezuela – and, by extension, in Cuba.

### 16. [Is the US preparing to strike Iran again?](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly5pd98z87o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

Is the US preparing to strike Iran again? Earlier this month, US President Donald Trump sent a message to Iranians who were protesting against the regime, that "help is on its way". Since then, there has been a slow, steady and significant build-up of US military forces in the region. America, which is the world's most powerful military, has already shown it can strike Iran. Last June's operation "Midnight Hammer" targeted its nuclear facilities. It involved more than 100 aircraft, with B-2 stealth jets flying all the way from the United States to deliver their "bunker-buster" precision guided bombs. The question now: Is the US getting ready to hit Iran, again? Donald Trump's latest social media post suggests he may, with him warning Iran that unless it makes a deal to limit its nuclear programme then "the next attack will be far worse!" The US president said a "massive Armada" was heading to Iran and - like in Venezuela where the US seized Nicolás Maduro - it was "ready, willing, and able to rapidly fulfil its mission, with speed and violence, if necessary". He called for Iran to come to the negotiating table but added that time was "running out". The US already has a significant military footprint in the Middle East, with up to 50,000 military personnel in the region. Around 10,000 of those are based at al-Udeid Airbase in Qatar. But the US also has bases in Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates. Over the past few weeks, open source intelligence reporting has tracked scores of additional US military aircraft arriving in the region. Photos taken on Sunday of al-Udeid Air Force Base - the largest American facility in the Middle East - show a number of new structures appearing at a site on its periphery. After the US strikes on Iran's nuclear complexes last year, Tehran launched missiles at al-Udeid. Now, there seems to be new anti-air defences being installed there, experts who were shown the satellite images said. The Pentagon does not provide a detailed list of those movements. But BBC Verify has been able to track the arrival of F-15 fighter jets and refuelling tankers. Drones and P-8 Poseidon spy planes have been seen operating near Iranian airspace on the FlightRadar24 tracking website. There has also been the arrival of transport aircraft, some of which are believed to be carrying more air defence systems. This may suggest that America is taking steps to defend itself and its Gulf allies from possible retaliatory strikes, if Trump ordered an attack on Iran. Britain, too, has sent a squadron of Typhoon jets to the area "to boost regional security". The US Air Force has announced that it is conducting a major exercise in the region, Operation Agile Spartan, "to demonstrate the ability to deploy, disperse, and sustain combat airpower across the US Central Command area of responsibility". Stefan Watkins, who tracks ships and shares his findings on social media, has also recently tracked the arrival of a number of US early warning and spy aircraft which were there during Operation Midnight Hammer – including RC-135s, and E-11A BACN and E-3G Sentry. He says that "might suggest" that strikes are "coming sooner rather than later". Just as significant is the arrival of a US carrier strike group to the region. The USS Abraham Lincoln was in the Indo-Pacific region when it was ordered to turn around and head to the Gulf. While the aircraft carrier has not publicly broadcast its location for more than a week, on Monday an Osprey aircraft's tracker was seen on FlightRadar24 landing in Oman after leaving an offshore location in the Gulf. That suggests the Lincoln could be operating somewhere near Oman. A carrier strike group is one of the most potent symbols of American military power, with an air wing of around 70 aircraft. On the USS Abraham Lincoln, that includes the latest F-35 stealth jets, capable of evading enemy radar. The strike group also has three destroyers loaded with Tomahawk land attack cruise missiles, and is normally accompanied by a nuclear powered submarine, which fires the same weapon. That is in addition to the two US destroyers already in the region. In the words of President Trump: "We have a big flotilla going in that region and we'll see what happens". Potential targets Matthew Savill, director of military sciences at the defence think tank Rusi, says that with their current military posture in the region, the US "could probably go almost anywhere in Iran and strike almost anything, apart from the most deeply buried facilities" – which would likely require B-2 bombers. So, what might the US target, if Trump gives the order? Savill, who worked on Iran policy with the UK government, says the US has a range of options. The first could be Iran's military capabilities, "like its ballistic missile threat or its coastal missile batteries". At the very least that could make it harder for the regime to retaliate, which it is threatening to do. Iran still has significant stockpiles of short range ballistic missiles and long range drones. That makes some of America's Gulf allies nervous. Some have already made clear they will not support more US strikes. Another option would be to target the regime itself. Savill says "they could go after the centres of military power, including Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps and maybe the militias that are suppressing the protesters". Trying to decapitate Iran's leadership, though, may prove more difficult and dangerous. Israel did target senior Iranians during its 12-day war last year. That included tracking bodyguards to find their locations. But Iran is likely to have since tightened up security and dispersed. Savill says the US "could probably find and kill senior individuals, but it is not clear what the cumulative effect would be". "We could be witnessing the final death throes of this current regime, but the problem is that could take months or even years to play out," Savill adds. While President Trump has proved that he is willing to use military force, he has made clear in the past that he has no desire to get involved in a long, protracted conflict. His military interventions so far have been short, sharp and limited. He has also not ruled out a diplomatic solution that would require Iran to agree to limit its nuclear programme. According to Savill, Trump is now having to "weigh the desire to be seen as decisive with the chances of actually achieving a decisive impact".

The politician whose death leaves a vacuum in India's richest state The sudden death of an influential leader has left a political vacuum in India's richest state. Ajit Pawar, the deputy chief minister of Maharashtra, died on Wednesday in a plane crash along with four others. Maharashtra's political landscape is notoriously complex - a web of shifting alliances, regional loyalties and rivalries. And for decades, Ajit Pawar navigated it with a mixture of pragmatism and shrewdness, swiftly rising through the ranks. Yet, beneath the public triumphs, his journey was also deeply personal: a struggle to emerge out of the formidable shadow of his uncle Sharad Pawar - the founder of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and a dominant figure in Indian politics. Born in 1959, Ajit Pawar entered politics in the 1980s under his uncle's mentorship, particularly focusing on the Pawar family stronghold of Baramati, a rural area in western Maharashtra where sugar cooperatives, banks and local institutions helped secure both economic influence and political loyalty. From an early age, Ajit Pawar was seen as the uncle's visible heir. But he was determined to forge his own path. To many, Sharad Pawar represented old-school authority: patient and strategic, he was known for his coalition-building skills and political instincts. Ajit Pawar, on the other hand, focused on regional power, governance and control over local political networks. His style was also markedly different. Where Sharad Pawar spoke in measured tones, Ajit Pawar was blunt and practical, his mercurial personality earning him both loyal supporters and vocal critics. But as his authority grew, so did his frustration. Ajit Pawar had risen quickly through the ranks of NCP, yet he was often seen as a lieutenant rather than a leader. Decisions were still made by the elder Pawar. The tensions simmered for years before erupting in public. In 2019, Ajit Pawar shocked Maharashtra by briefly breaking ranks with his uncle and aligning with the rival Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to form the government and claim the deputy chief minister's post. His effort to strike out by himself collapsed within days, undone by Sharad Pawar who intervened to reclaim control of the party and help his allies form the government But for the first time, the family rift was out in the open. Ajit Pawar returned to the party, but the breach never fully healed. Things finally came to head four years later in 2023, when Ajit Pawar broke away from his uncle's NCP party, joined a new governing coalition led by the BJP and claimed the post of the deputy chief minister once again. This time, he also managed to split his uncle's party and claim the name and electoral symbol of NCP as his own. From then, family gatherings dwindled, public appearances were mostly separate, and the Pawar name, once seen as a single axis of power, fractured into two rival camps. For Ajit Pawar's supporters, the defection was long overdue and a courageous step, reflecting his ability to adapt in India's political system, where even bitter ideological opponents might join hands to come to power. To critics, he symbolised opportunistic politics. The rupture has since become one of the most remarked-upon political dramas in Maharashtra, one that transformed its fault lines. In recent days, after civic elections in Pune and Mumbai, conversations had begun about the possibility of a reconciliation between the two factions of the NCP, led by uncle and nephew. Some speculated that Ajit Pawar might even emerge as the leader of a united party. His sudden death has brought those possibilities to an abrupt halt. Questions now swirl about whether the lawmakers who had left with him will accept the authority of his cousin, Supriya Sule - Sharad Pawar's daughter - or his wife or son, and whether the fragile alliances he nurtured can endure. Ajit Pawar leaves behind him a divided political legacy - and a reminder of how personal ambitions and familial ties can shape politics in the most surprising ways.

**Excerpt**

Why China views the UK visit as part of something bigger Beijing is not always the most welcoming place in winter. Frigid air blows in from the north, blast-freezing the city's lakes and rivers and only the hardiest souls would dare to plunge into the icy water. And yet, in the last two months, leaders from around the world have accepted invitations to the Chinese capital. There's been a flurry of visits from France, South Korea, Ireland, Canada and Finland. The German Chancellor is due next month. And now among the western leaders making a beeline for Beijing is Sir Keir Starmer, the first British prime minister to visit China in eight years. He seems to be guaranteed a warm welcome, especially after the UK recently approved plans for a Chinese mega-embassy in London. Officials in China had already warned their counterparts that they would not announce the prime minister's visit until this issue was resolved. But both sides are now ready to get around the table and for the UK, dozens of new deals are on the line to boost the country's economy. "If the two sides could move ahead with a reasonable trading relationship, that is already an achievement," says Dr Yu Jie, a Senior Research Fellow on the China, Asia-Pacific Programme at the Chatham House think tank. One major question is to what extent China sees visits by the likes of Starmer as part of a bigger geopolitical shakedown? And how close does it really think it can become with the UK? Carney the trailblazer For China, this is part of a charm offensive in the hope that some will now look at Beijing as a stable, predictable partner - in contrast to the US. It seemed to work with Mark Carney, the Canadian prime minister, who visited earlier this month. He has blazed a trail for other world leaders by travelling to Beijing and announcing a "new strategic partnership with China". Even before his speech in Davos, Carney told reporters in the Chinese capital that the global order was at a "point of rupture." This was a dramatic turnaround for a relationship between two nations that had been in the deep freeze for a decade, and it will be music to President Xi Jinping 's ears. US President Donald Trump, however, has threatened to impose a 100% tariff on Canada if Carney made a trade deal with China. The message from Washington appears to be that if you do a deal with one superpower, you risk the wrath of another. Starmer's delicate dance Starmer has already tried to sidestep this geopolitical landmine, and before he got on the plane, he made it clear he will not choose between the US and China. Some analysts believe that the Chinese will be clear-eyed about their ability to cause a rift in the so-called "special relationship". "Beijing will be realistic," says Dr Yu Jie, "rather than think they can pivot the UK away from the US." What was once dubbed a "golden age" for UK-Chinese relations has evolved into what Starmer has called an "ice age". But with so many difficulties to navigate, a full rekindling of the old relationship is unlikely - it is more realistically the start of a slow diplomatic thaw. The long-gone good times In the warmth of a pub in the Hutongs, a traditional area in Beijing close to Tiananmen Square, the bright piercing sound of Celtic pipes burst from two speakers, as Bowei Wang pours a pint of brown ale. He is one of a million Chinese people who've studied in the UK in the last two decades, dating back to that so-called "golden era" between the two countries. "The beer is everything for me," Wang tells me as he takes a sip. This was one of the first ales he made in his Overtone brewery in Glasgow. "Fifteen years ago, when I was studying in Scotland, I said, 'Wow, British beer is so good, I want to bring it back to China in the future'." And so, he has. The beer is now a cross-cultural ale. It is brewed in Yoker in Glasgow, shipped to China and served from a bar in Beijing where scenes from the film Braveheart play on one large television while Elizabeth I is on another. The defining photo from the "golden era", when the UK advocated for closer economic ties, is a shot of the then Prime Minister David Cameron and President Xi sharing a pint and a basket of fish and chips at the Plough Pub in 2015. For the UK, this would be unthinkable now as it tries to navigate between its need to do business and its concerns over security. China remains a huge threat to national security as intelligence agencies continue to raise concerns about spying and intellectual property theft. There are also continuing threats to Chinese nationals who've fled the country and have tried to make the UK a haven and their home. And from China's perspective, the 11 years since that meeting have seen it gain huge economic power. A return to a new "golden era" is "wishful thinking," says Dr Yu Jie. "The economic parity between Beijing and London has changed dramatically since the so-called 'golden era' was declared. If the two sides could move ahead with a reasonable trading relationship, that is already an achievement," she said. Xi is a far more confident leader now than when he met Starmer's predecessors, Theresa May and Cameron. China is riding high after its battle against the US last year in a tit-for-tat trade war. It ended in a truce last October when the two leaders met in South Korea, but Xi will believe he has shown America and the world just how dependent they are on Chinese goods. This country now makes around one third of all the world's goods, it processes more than 90% of the world's rare earth minerals, it produces around 60 to 80% of all solar panels, wind turbines and electric vehicles. This gives China real leverage over much of the world - including the UK. And the Chinese are quick to use it as a weapon if a country says or does something it dislikes. In the past it has imposed tariffs, stopped buying or stopped exporting key products. South Korea, Australia, Japan and Canada have all felt the wrath of Beijing at some point in the last decade. A different relationship So if not a golden era - could this at least be a golden opportunity? "I think it's very important that this visit takes place," Tom Simpson, managing director at the China Britain Business Council, told me in their offices in the capital. "China is the UK's third largest trading partner. The UK exports around £45 billion of goods and services to China. It's an incredibly important market for the UK. And I think a visit like this really strengthens confidence among our companies to invest here, for Chinese companies to invest in the UK, and the overall trading relationship between the UK and China." But Professor Gao Jian from Shanghai International Studies University is concerned that Starmer talks of engagement with China - but does not act. "In the past two years, the reality has not met the promises he has made when it comes to China," he says "Everything has remained lukewarm." Chinese analysts have also raised concerns that the current UK prime minister may not be in office for long. "My judgement of Britain's domestic situation is quite negative," he says. "Forgive my use of the word, but it seems to be in chaos and the Labour Party's future is very much in danger." Back in the pub in the Hutongs, a group of Dutch tourists who've been on a cycle tour come in for some heat and a pint, led by a British travel company - Our Beijing. He hopes this visit will open the door for more British tourists to visit China visa-free. Currently, British passport holders need a special visa to enter China. But Beijing has now dropped its visa requirements for 70 countries, and the UK hopes to be added to that list. "Until you come over and see China for yourself, you're never going to know. I'm desperately trying to get more and more people to really experience the Beijing that me, my wife, and my friends, fell in love with, which is cheesy, I know, but it's true," says Dom, who is leading the group. China is a vast country full of possibilities and pitfalls. But for now, Starmer and others who are bundling up in the cold weather to make their way to Beijing this winter, believe this journey is a risk worth taking.
