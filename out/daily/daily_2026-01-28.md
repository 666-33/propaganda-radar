Trump says government will 'de-escalate' in Minnesota following Pretti shooting President Donald Trump said his administration was "going to de-escalate a little bit" in Minnesota, after the second fatal shooting of a US citizen by federal immigration officers there. "Bottom line, it was terrible. Both of them were terrible," he said in a Fox News interview on Tuesday. In early January Renee Good was fatally shot by an immigration officer, followed by Alex Pretti, who was killed after being stopped by border agents this past weekend. Pretti's death reignited local protests and public outcry across the country, and led to criticism from lawmakers in both parties. Trump's remarks are the latest sign his administration is taking a step back on its operations in Minnesota. On Monday, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) pulled the Minnesota mission's leader and figurehead, Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino, from the state. DHS said it was deploying the White House's border tsar, Tom Homan, to take over there and Homan was set to meet with local officials this week. On Tuesday, Homan posted on social media that he had met with Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, and local law enforcement officials. Speaking to other reporters ahead of a rally in Iowa Tuesday night, Trump said he viewed the killing of Pretti, an intensive care nurse at a veterans' hospital, as "a very unfortunate incident". Asked by reporters about whether he agreed with characterisations of Pretti as a "domestic terrorist," Trump said: "I haven't heard that." Trump then added: "He shouldn't have been carrying a gun." Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Pretti was shot because he was "brandishing" a gun during a confrontation, but local authorities said the gun was legally registered and that Pretti was shot after the firearm was removed. DHS has also said the agents fired in self-defence, after Pretti resisted attempts to disarm him. Eyewitnesses and local officials, though, have challenged that account, saying he had a phone in his hand, not a weapon. "He wasn't there to peacefully protest, he was there to perpetuate violence," Noem said in the immediate aftermath of the shooting, accusing Pretti of "domestic terrorism". Pretti's death, coming two weeks after the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Good, enraged local residents and sparked fresh calls from state and city officials for the Trump administration to withdraw its 3,000 immigration agents and officers from the region. In the interview with Fox News, Trump appeared to defend the Minnesota operation, saying "we took thousands of hardened criminals" out of the state, "so they have good crime numbers." "That's all working out, we have Tom Homan there now," he said, before adding the administration would "de-escalate". Stephen Miller, a top White House aide working on the administration's deportation initiative, told CNN that the White House "provided clear guidance to DHS that the extra personnel that had been sent to Minnesota for force protection should be used for conducting fugitive operations to create a physical barrier between the arrest teams and the disruptors". "We are evaluating why the [US Customs and Border Patrol] team may not have been following that protocol," Miller said in his statement to CNN. Some Republican leaders and lawmakers have called for an investigation into Pretti's death, including Vermont Governor Phil Scott and US Senator Pete Ricketts of Nebraska. "The nation witnessed a horrifying situation this weekend," Ricketts wrote on X. While he reaffirmed his "support for funding ICE remains the same," Ricketts said he expected "a prioritized, transparent investigation into this incident". A federal judge has blocked DHS from destroying or altering evidence. In his speech at the Iowa rally on Tuesday night, which was dedicated to his economic policies, Trump did not discuss the current situation in Minnesota in-depth, but talked about his immigration crackdown more broadly, citing a Harvard Harris poll from December that suggested 80% of Americans support his administration's efforts to deport illegal immigrants who have committed crimes.

**Excerpt**

Minnesota congresswoman Ilhan Omar attacked with 'unknown liquid' during town hall Minnesota Representative Ilhan Omar was attacked with an unknown substance at a town hall she was hosting on Tuesday, when an audience member used a syringe to spray liquid at her, Minneapolis police said. Omar was uninjured and continued to speak. The man was immediately arrested and forensics were being conducted at the scene, police added. "I thought it was one of her aides going up to hand her a note or something," Jacquelynn Goessling said of the man that attacked Omar with liquid, the acrid smell of which consumed the front of the room. In a statement on X, Omar said: "I'm ok. I'm a survivor so this small agitator isn't going to intimidate me from doing my work. I don't let bullies win." After the incident, Omar told the room that "we will continue... we are Minnesota strong". Another attendee, Alfred Flowers Jr, told the BBC that he "respected her courage and strength to still stay and finish the town hall for the people". Video from the scene shows the team shouting "make a hole" as they wrestled the man out of the room. As he was pushed out of the room, he said that Omar was "pitting us against each other". It was not immediately clear who the man was referring to. The liquid he sprayed on Omar had a sour smell that was similar to a chemical product, according to a BBC journalist in the room. In a post on social media, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said: "Violence and intimidation have no place in Minneapolis. We can disagree without putting people at risk... This kind of behavior will not be tolerated in our city." In 2019, Omar became the first Somali-American, first African-born American, and one of the first two Muslim American women to serve in the US Congress. The event was one of the regular town halls hosted by Omar, and about 100 people were in attendance in the north Minneapolis basement, expecting to hear about the presence of federal immigration officials in their town and ask questions after the second fatal shooting of an American citizen by immigration officials this month. In January, an immigration officer fatally shot US citizen Renee Good. Last week, US citizen Alex Pretti was fatally shot after being stopped by border agents, reigniting local protests and public outcry. At the town hall, Omar called for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to be "abolished" and said Department of Homeland Secretary Kristi Noem should "resign or face impeachment". It was after these comments that the man attacked. Officials pleaded with the Congresswoman to end the town hall but she insisted on continuing. Speaking again at the podium Omar said: "We're gonna keep talking. Just give me ten minutes. Please don't let them have the show. Please don't let them have the show." Many in the area see the increased immigration enforcement action as a response to President Donald Trump's dislike of Omar who he has called a "radical left lunatic". On Tuesday, responding to the second fatal shooting, Trump said his administration was "going to de-escalate a little bit" in Minnesota. Additional reporting by Kristina Volk.

### 3. [Who is Tom Homan, Trump's 'border tsar' deployed to Minneapolis?](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjw1pn4lwjqo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

Who is Tom Homan, Trump's 'border tsar' deployed to Minneapolis? US President Donald Trump has deployed his "border tsar" Tom Homan to lead on-the-ground immigration enforcement in Minneapolis, after two US citizens were shot dead by federal agents in the city in less than a month. The White House has said Homan, who arrived in Minneapolis on Tuesday, will now be the "main point of contact on the ground" and will meet with city officials. It comes as Gregory Bovino, the US border patrol chief and public face of the Trump administration's mass deportation drive in cities across the US, is expected to leave the city along with some of his agents. Homan, 64, is seen both as a key Trump ally and someone with decades of experience in immigration policy across both Republican and Democratic administrations. He is also one of the most vocal defenders of Trump's immigration policy and mass deportation drive. A native of upstate New York, Homan began his career in law enforcement as a police officer before joining border patrol in 1984 in southern California. He joined what was then called the Immigration and Naturalization Service four years later, climbing through the ranks of US immigration enforcement over multiple years. By 2013 - under the Obama administration - he held a little-known but influential post heading the Enforcement and Removal Operations arm of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) Homan had planned to retire in 2017, just days before Trump's first administration began. An abrupt call at his retirement party from incoming Chief of Staff John Kelly changed those plans. "I remember him saying, I know it was bad timing, but the president-elect wanted me to stay and run [ICE]," Homan recalled in an interview last year with the Daily Caller. "Monday morning, I called [Kelly] and said I want to come back." A similar call, this time from current Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, again brought him out of retirement in 2024 ahead of the second administration. While "border tsar" is an informal term and position, it refers to an executive-branch role overseeing border and immigration policy across multiple agencies. It is not Senate confirmed, and is a policy position directly appointed by the serving president. So far in Trump's second term, Homan has been a vocal defender of the president's broad deportation goals, vowing to target the "worst of the worst" and challenge the notion that "those who enforce the law are the bad guys and those who break the law are the victims". But in practice, enforcing immigration laws and attempting to focus on public safety threats has also ensnared other undocumented migrants who have no criminal background - a fact that Homan acknowledges and blames on "sanctuary cities" that do not work with federal immigration efforts. Officials have said the act of being in the US illegally is a crime in itself. "We're not going to instruct ICE not to arrest [someone] unless there's a serious crime," he told reporters in July at the White House, where he makes regular appearances. "What message does that send the whole world? Go ahead and enter the country," Homan added. In September, the White House swiftly came to Homan's defence after reports emerged that he was accused in a bribery case that was ultimately dropped by the justice department when Trump returned to office. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt described that case - which allegedly saw Homan accept $50,000 (£36,3000) from undercover agents - as an effort to "entrap" a key Trump ally. Who is Greg Bovino and why is he being replaced? Unlike Homan, Bovino has spent almost his entire law enforcement career in border cities, having first joined Border Patrol in 1996 and serving in a variety of US domestic postings as well as overseas in Honduras and Africa. The North Carolina native rose to prominence in Trump's second term, taking the lead during immigration crackdowns in Los Angeles, Chicago, New Orleans and Minneapolis. Bovino has been serving as "commander-at-large" in Border Patrol - an informal role outside of the organisation's formal hierarchy. Border Patrol is one of several immigration-centred agencies that operates under the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Bovino reportedly answers directly to DHS head Kristi Noem. In his informal role, he works alongside officials like the Chief of Border Patrol, a position held by Michael Banks, and the Customs and Border Protection commissioner, a position currently held by Rodney Scott. Bovino's tactics have been both controversial, particularly the aggressive "turn and burn" method of making swift arrests before protesters can arrive to an area. "We're going to turn and burn to that next target and the next and the next and the next," he told the AP of the tactic. "We're not going to stop." Bovino has also earned a reputation as an official willing to clash with lawmakers. In recent days, for example, Bovino has publicly sparred with lawmakers from both parties who expressed concern about his operations in Minneapolis. Will leadership switch mean change in Minneapolis? Bovino being replaced with Homan in Minneapolis is seen by some political observers as recognition from the White House that an urgent change was needed amid growing public concern. In practice, however, that change is ultimately unlikely to alter the administration's approach to immigration enforcement. "Homan has more years at ICE and doing interior enforcement," former DHS immigration official Lora Ries told the BBC of his work in many American cities not near the border. "This isn't a surprise to me." Ries, now head of the border security and immigration centre at the conservative-leaning Heritage Foundation in Washington, added that while Homan has said he's sought to focus "on the worst, first", all deportable undocumented migrants will continue to be "on the table". For immigration activists, Homan's career - which has included staunch defence of Trump's family separation policy, which led to separating children from parents who are in the country illegally - also means that they see little practical difference between him and Bovino. "I'm not sure it means much. Homan is a career deportation advocate, and the architect of family separation," said Michael Lukens, the executive director of the Amica Center, an organisation which helps immigrants with legal access and services. "I think the difference is that he is more polished than Bovino. He is better at speaking to the press, and stakeholders," he added. "He's better for what they need, someone to paint their actions as not what they are." "This is much more about whether the White House sees this as a political issue, not a human one," Lukens added. "But there is no world in which Homan is a moderate."

### 4. [Republicans criticise immigration force but steer clear of Trump attacks](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj3vp84j1l3o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

Republicans criticise immigration force but steer clear of Trump attacks Republican lawmakers are starting to break with the Trump administration over its immigration crackdown in Minneapolis, as the party scrambles to respond to growing public anger after two US citizens were killed by federal agents. But even as some Republicans in Washington speak out against the fatal shootings, they've avoided directly criticising President Donald Trump or his broader immigration agenda. The emerging messaging on Minneapolis points to the party's main dilemma heading into the midterm elections: whether and how to distance itself from the biggest controversies of Trump's second term, while running on his overall record on immigration and other issues - a record that's popular on the right, and that most Republicans helped push through Congress. Their response to the fast-moving events in Minneapolis underscores the delicate balancing act. Public anger forces a new focus So far, Republicans have focused criticism on US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE - the agency at the forefront of the Minneapolis operation - and other agencies within the Department of Homeland Security taking part. At the same time, Republicans have backed Trump's immigration plans since his return to the White House, but now avoid highlighting their support. Last year, the Republican-controlled Congress approved roughly $45 billion for border security and additional funding for interior enforcement to help the administration carry out Trump's plan to deport millions of undocumented migrants from the country. That support continued as opinion polls have consistently shown a majority of Americans believe ICE has gone too far in its tactics under Trump. A New York Times/Siena poll out last Friday found that 61 percent of voters believe ICE's tactics have "gone too far." The survey came out two weeks after Renee Good, a US citizen, was fatally shot by a federal agent in Minneapolis, and one day before another American citizen, Alex Pretti, was killed by agents in the city, sparking nationwide protests. In the face of public outcry over the killings, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, the chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs, called on Monday for the leaders of ICE and two other federal agencies to testify before his panel next month. The request came alongside calls from other Senate Republicans for more oversight of ICE after Pretti's shooting. "The tragedy and chaos the country is witnessing in Minneapolis is shocking," Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska wrote on social media. "ICE agents do not have carte blanche in carrying out their duties." Murkowski's condemnation does not come as a major surprise. The Alaska moderate is one of a small handful of Republicans in Congress who've been willing to openly criticise Trump since he first entered office. Paul also has clashed with the president and administration on issues in the past. Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina on Tuesday became one of the first prominent Republicans to call for DHS Secretary Kristi Noem to step down. Noem "has proven to be way out of her depth," Tillis told reporters, adding that her leadership in Minnesota "should be disqualifying." The White House has said Trump has confidence in Noem. Facing 'serious, unanswered questions' Moderate Republicans like Murkowski aren't the only ones in the party criticising the immigration operation in Minnesota. In recent days some of Trump's allies in Congress also began speaking out against the shootings, though most issued carefully worded statements that didn't explicitly mention the president. "There are serious unanswered questions about federal use of force in Minnesota. Transparency and accountability are essential," said Representative Max Miller of Ohio, a former Trump adviser. Representative Andrew Garbarino of New York, the chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, called on the heads of ICE and other agencies to testify before Congress. Garbarino also came out in support of a full investigation into Pretti's shooting. "Congress has an important responsibility to ensure the safety of law enforcement and the people they serve and protect," Garbarino said. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas issued a more direct criticism of the administration after the Pretti shooting. But he focused on the administration's rhetoric in response to the shooting and didn't break with Trump's larger agenda. "What I think the administration could do better is the tone with which they're describing this - that immediately when an incident like this happens, they come out guns blazing that we took out a violent terrorist, hooray," Cruz said Monday on his podcast, Verdict with Ted Cruz. The Republican response also is complicated by the gun ownership debate that has pitted the administration against the National Rifle Association, a traditional ally of the political right. A Trump-appointed federal prosecutor in Los Angeles said in a social media post after Pretti's death that people who approach law enforcement officials armed should expect that there is a "high likelihood" they'll get shot. The NRA slammed the remarks. "Responsible public voices should be awaiting a full investigation, not making generalisations and demonising law-abiding citizens," the NRA said in a statement. Some Republican lawmakers defend immigration enforcement underway in Minneapolis and other US cities. Trump's immigration policies remain popular with the party's base, and after the recent shootings in Minneapolis some Republican voters in the state told the BBC they didn't think the president should do anything differently. "They're just doing their job, which is right," Jay Cielinski, said of ICE in an interview Tuesday in his hometown of Zimmerman, a roughly 50-minute drive north of Minneapolis. The 59-year-old home inspector and self-described Trump supporter also said protesters, and state and local officials shouldn't interfere with federal immigration operations, a view echoed by many Republicans including Trump and other senior administration officials. "They should stay at home, stay out of the way," Cielinski said of people who protest federal immigration operations. "Law enforcement officials at the city, state, county [levels] should be encouraging ICE to go in. They should expose the people that are illegal." Still, the cautious rebukes from Cruz and other prominent Republicans in Washington signaled an attempt to hold the administration accountable without alienating supporters like Cielinski. Pivoting to a softer approach The growing criticisms from Republican lawmakers came as Trump shifted his own tone in recent days after more facts emerged about the circumstances surrounding Pretti's death. After the shooting Trump initially called Pretti a "gunman," and other senior US officials claimed the 37-year-old ICU nurse had turned up armed at an enforcement action to try and kill federal agents. But others have disputed that, saying Pretti was filming ICE agents with his phone then helping a woman pushed on the ground, and that he was not armed when he was shot. Trump has since softened his rhetoric, and taken steps to try and ease tensions in Minneapolis. This week, he sent White House border tsar Tom Homan to take over the operation there, known as Operation Metro Surge. Homan's arrival represented a shakeup in leadership, as top Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino is expected to leave the city. Trump suggested on Tuesday that sending Homan to Minneapolis was intended to bring calm there. "We're going to de-escalate a little bit," Trump said in a Fox News interview. The president also held calls on Monday with Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, both of whom are Democrats. Frey said afterwards that Trump told him the "present situation" in Minneapolis can't continue. White House officials pulled back their rhetoric, too. "Nobody in the White House, including President Trump, wants to see people getting hurt or killed in America's streets," White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Monday. "It is President Trump's hope and wish and demand for the resistance and chaos to end today." The remarks appear to have opened the doors for more Republicans to voice concern about the shootings. But the party's future approach to its immigration messaging remains to be seen - both in the run-up to the midterms later this year and in the aftermath of the violence in Minneapolis. Already, there are signs of a shutdown battle over immigration policy that could push lawmakers into their partisan camps. Senate Democrats vowed to block a spending package if it includes additional funding for DHS, setting the stage for a possible government shutdown later this week. The fight could pressure Trump's party to defend his immigration agenda and overshadow Republican calls for investigations into the shootings in Minneapolis. Republicans also will likely continue taking their cues from Trump. How he responds will shape the debate in the days and weeks ahead. Ana Faguy and Kristina Volk contributed reporting from Minneapolis.

Zelensky condemns deadly Russian drone strike on passenger train Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has condemned as "terrorism" a Russian drone attack on a passenger train that local officials say killed at least four people. Zelensky said another four people were missing after the train with more than 200 people on board was hit in Ukraine's north-eastern Kharkiv region on Tuesday. Earlier, officials in Ukraine's southern port of Odesa said three people were killed in an overnight Russian drone attack. Russia has not commented. Moscow has in recent months intensified its drone and missile strikes targeting Ukraine's energy and transport infrastructure as the country faces its harshest winter in years. Millions of people across Ukraine have been left without heating, electricity and water after the Russian assaults. Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion in February 2022, and Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory. In a post on social media late on Tuesday, Zelensky wrote: "In any country, a drone strike on a civilian train would be considered in exactly the same way - purely as terrorism". He said there was no "military justification" in targeting civilians, adding that there were 18 people in the carriage that was hit. Pictures and footage released by Ukraine's emergency services show at least one badly destroyed carriage still burning after the attack. Kharkiv's regional prosecutor's office said the train was struck near the Yazykove village. One drone hit a carriage directly, and another two exploded near the train. The office said the train was heading from the western border town of Chop to Barvinkove in the Kharkiv region via the regional capital Kharkiv. This line runs further east to the Donetsk region, and is used by local residents as well as Ukrainian soldiers travelling to and from leave. Separately, officials in Odesa said that overnight Russia launched more than 50 drones on the port, targeting energy and other civilian infrastructure City military head Serhiy Lysak said three people were killed and 25 injured in the attack. Several floors of one residential building collapsed after the strike, and a number of other buildings were damaged. Russia's daily aerial assaults continue even though Ukraine-Russia talks last week held the latest round of talks aimed at ending the war. The talks that also involved US negotiators took place in the United Arab Emirate, and were hailed by all sides as constructive. However, key territorial issues remain unresolved, and further meetings are expected this weekend.

Mexico president asks South Korea for more BTS concerts The scramble for tickets to K-pop band BTS' comeback tour, which comes after a four-year hiatus, has seen Mexico's president appealing to her South Korean counterpart to add more shows in her country. "I wrote a letter to the [president] of Korea... I still haven't received the answer, but let's hope it's positive," Mexico's president Claudia Sheinbaum said on Monday. BTS will hold three shows in Mexico City in May, as part of its 79-date world tour after a four-year hiatus. Tickets were wiped out in less than 40 minutes, local media reported. Some fans have also accused Ticketmaster and resale platforms of dynamic pricing, prompting an investigation. While on Ticketmaster, the official sales channel, tickets were going for between 1,800 pesos and 17,800 pesos ($100 to $1,030; £76 to £750), resale platforms were offering them for between 11,300 to 92,100 pesos, according to Reuters. Mexico's consumer watchdog has sanctioned resale platforms StubHub and Viagogo for "abusive and disloyal practices" over the ticketing process. About a million young people were vying for 150,000 BTS concert tickets, Sheinbaum said on Monday. "This group, BTS, is very popular among young Mexicans," she said. Spotify lists Mexico as K-pop's fifth-largest market worldwide, with streaming of the genre's songs growing more than 500% in the country in the last five years. Sheinbaum wrote to South Korea's President Lee Jae Myung after being told by local concert promoter Ocesa that the band's packed itinerary made adding shows unfeasible. Seoul's presidential office and foreign ministry have declined to comment on the matter, according to South Korean media. BTS has not released music as a group since June 2022, as they took a break to explore individual music careers and later underwent mandatory military service. The septet's globe-spanning comeback tour – likely to be one of the biggest tours of the year – will kick off with three nights in South Korea's Goyang Stadium on 9 April, before travelling across across Asia, Europe and America. According to Billboard, the group and their record label Hybe stand to make more than $1bn (£740m) from the tour, across concerts, merchandise, licensing, album sales and streaming revenue.

**Excerpt**

Trump says US will 'no longer help Iraq' if it picks Maliki as PM President Donald Trump has threatened to end US support for Iraq if former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki wins power again. Maliki, who has links to Iran, was selected at the weekend by an alliance of Shia-led parties as its nominee for prime minister. The US president wrote on Truth Social that Maliki would be a "very bad choice", adding: "Last time Maliki was in power, the Country descended into poverty and total chaos." Maliki, whose time in office between 2006 and 2014 was marked by sectarian violence, stepped down after Islamic State seized large parts of the country. After being endorsed by a Shia coalition known as the Coordination Framework on Saturday, Maliki would then normally be nominated by the president, who holds a largely ceremonial role. Iraq's parliament was set to elect a president on Tuesday but the vote was delayed after the presidential candidate could not be agreed on. Influential Shia groups in Baghdad have varying links to neighbouring Iran's Islamic Republic, which is also controlled by Shia clerics. Washington has voiced concerns about Iranian-linked groups deepening its influence in the region, including Iraq. Trump said the country would have "zero" chance of success without US support after vowing to "no longer help" the country if Maliki was elected. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio expressed concern about Maliki's links to Iran during a call with incumbent Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani on Sunday, emphasising "that a government controlled by Iran cannot successfully put Iraq's own interest first". Trump has frequently bucked precedence by intervening in other countries' elections, backing fellow right-wing candidates in elections in Poland, Romania and Honduras, where the US-backed winner was inaugurated on Tuesday. Earlier this month, the American military seized then-Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro in order for him to face trial in New York. Maliki led Iraq after the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, which led to the removal and eventual execution of Saddam Hussein who had overseen a brutal repression of Shia Muslims over three decades. During his time in office, Maliki led a chaotic period during which sectarian violence escalated between Kurdish and Sunni groups. The aggressive crackdown on opponents was blamed for radicalising the Islamic State group of Sunni extremists, which came to control large swathes of territory and several key cities by the time Maliki stepped down in 2014.

Neil Young offers Greenlanders free access to his archives Canadian-American rock star Neil Young is offering Greenlanders a year's free access to his archives in what he hopes will "ease some of the unwarranted stress and threats" they are receiving from the Trump administration. President Donald Trump has threatened to annex the Danish territory for what he says are national security reasons, though recently walked back comments, saying he was seeking "immediate negotiations" and insisting he "won't use force". Young is known for his political protests, and has long been a vocal critic of Trump. He announced the offer "of peace and love" on his website, where he added that he hoped "other organisations will follow in the spirit of our example." In his statement, signed "love earth", Young refers to the Trump administration as "our unpopular and hopefully temporary government". Access to Young's digital archive usually starts at around $25 (£18), depending on the subscription package. To secure free access, a Greenland registered mobile phone number will be required for verification. In 2020 Young took legal action to try to stop the president from using his music at campaign rallies. Earlier this month, Young wrote on his website: "Wake up people! Today the USA is a disaster. Donald Trump is destroying America bit by bit with his staff of wannabes... He has divided us." Young has also called on people to boycott Amazon over owner Jeff Bezos's donations to the Trump campaign and support for the administration. In 2024, Young ended a two-year boycott of streaming giant Spotify, which he had started in opposition to the platform streaming Joe Rogan's podcast. In 2022, he told Spotify to remove hits like Harvest Moon and Heart of Gold, complaining that Rogan was spreading vaccine misinformation on the streaming service. Other artists, including Joni Mitchell and India Arie, also removed their songs in solidarity. The singer said at the time that his return did not reflect a reversal of his stance, but that the decision came after Rogan signed a $250m (£181m) deal to make his podcast available on multiple platforms, rather than remaining a Spotify exclusive. Neil Young was born in Canada but later moved to the US and holds dual citizenship.

Spain plans to give half a million undocumented migrants legal status The Spanish government has announced a plan to legalise the status of undocumented migrants, a measure expected to benefit at least half a million people. Regularisation will be available to foreign nationals who do not have a criminal record and can prove they lived in Spain for at least five months prior to 31 December 2025. "This is an historic day for our country," said Elma Saiz, Spain's minister of inclusion, social security and migration. The measure will provide beneficiaries with an initial one-year residence permit, which can then be extended. Requests for legalisation are expected to begin in April and the process will remain open until the end of June. "We are reinforcing a migratory model based on human rights, integration, co-existence and which is compatible with economic growth and social cohesion," Saiz said. Spain has seen a large influx of migrants in recent years, mainly from Latin America. The conservative think-tank Funcas found that the number of undocumented migrants in Spain had risen from 107,409 in 2017 to 837,938 in 2025 - an eight-fold increase. The highest number of undocumented arrivals currently living in Spain are believed to be from Colombia, Peru and Honduras. Spain's socialist-led coalition government has been an outlier on this issue among the larger European nations, underlining the importance of migrants for the economy. The country has been outperforming the other main EU economies in recent years, posting expected growth of close to 3% in 2025. Unemployment, a longstanding weakness of the Spanish economy, has dipped below 10% for the first time since 2008, according to figures released on Tuesday. Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has described immigrants as representing "wealth, development and prosperity" for Spain, pointing to their contribution to the social security system. The government and parties on the left have also emphasised the need to treat migrants in a humane way. "Providing rights is the answer to racism," said Irene Montero, of the far-left Podemos party and a former minister in a coalition government with the Socialists. She has campaigned for this measure, which followed an agreement between the party and the government. A civic legislative proposal, calling for a mass migrant regularisation, received the support of around 700,000 people but had been languishing in parliament. This measure will be approved by royal decree, meaning it does not require parliamentary approval. It is the first large-scale migrant regularisation in Spain for two decades. Several such initiatives, by governments of both the Socialists and the conservative People's Party (PP), legalised the status of an estimated half a million migrants between 1986 and 2005. However, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, leader of the PP, said the latest mass legalisation would "increase the pull effect and overwhelm our public services". Pepa Millán, spokeswoman for the far-right Vox, said the initiative "attacks our identity", adding that the party would appeal before the Supreme Court in a bid to block it.

US to send ICE agents to Winter Olympics, prompting Italian anger The US immigration agency whose officers have been involved in a fatal shooting in Minneapolis has said it is sending agents to help support American security operations during the Winter Olympics, which start in Italy on 6 February. Confirmation that a branch of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) would play a role came from several US departments, after reports prompted alarm and anger in Italy. "This is a militia that kills... of course they're not welcome in Milan," Milan Mayor Beppe Sala told Italian radio on Tuesday. Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani, in a bid to cool tensions, told reporters "it's not like the [Nazi] SS are coming". He was speaking on the sidelines of a ceremony marking Holocaust Remembrance Day, attended by three Jewish Italians who survived the Holocaust. It is common for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and domestic law enforcement agencies to provide security support at major international events. DHS stressed that "all security operations at the Olympics are directed and managed exclusively by Italian authorities". Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said on Tuesday that no ICE agents would appear on Italian streets, only officers from the police, the Carabinieri military police and the Guardia di Finanza financial authority. The interior ministry said later that the US would set up an operations room at its consulate in Milan, where relevant US agencies would work during the Games. US embassy sources in Rome had already explained to Italian media that various federal agencies had worked at previous Games in the past, although it was not clear if ICE had itself taken part. US officials said the role of Homeland Security Investigations - which is part of ICE - would be "strictly supportive - working with the Diplomatic Security Service and Italian authorities to vet and mitigate risks from transnational criminal organisations". It would "obviously" not conduct immigration enforcement operations outside the US, homeland security department spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin told the BBC. Antonio Tajani told reporters that the ICE agents who were coming were not "those with machine guns and their faces covered... they're coming because it's the department responsible for counter-terrorism". Italy's Interior Minister Matteo Pantedosi had initially appeared unaware that US immigration officials would be coming to the Milan-Cortina Olympics and said even if they were, foreign delegations could choose their own security, saying: "I don't see what the problem is and it's very normal." But as shock at the images emanating from Minneapolis grew, so did the outcry in Italy that officers from the same US federal agency could appear on Italian streets. An ICE agent fatally shot Renee Nicole Good on 7 January in a Minneapolis street, prompting nationwide protests. And in the aftermath of Alex Pretti being shot by US border patrol agents - from another DHS agency - on Saturday morning, two journalists for Italian public broadcaster Rai were threatened by ICE officials as the reporters drove around the city covering the agency's actions. The Rai TV report showed one agent warned the crew that if they kept filming the agents, their car window would be smashed. The governor of Lombardy region, Attilio Fontana, sought to calm the situation, suggesting that ICE agents would be deployed in Italy to protect US Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Political opponents of right-wing Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, such as Five Star Senator Barbara Floridia, warned that continued government silence on the issue would provide "yet more evidence of cowardice and subservience towards Donald Trump". The interior minister has since taken a stronger stand, maintaining on Monday that "ICE will certainly not operate on Italian national territory". The US had not communicated a list of security personnel, and security was guaranteed by the Italian state, he said. The centre-left mayor of Milan was unimpressed. "I believe [ICE agents] shouldn't come to Italy because they don't guarantee they conform to our democratic way of ensuring security," Beppe Sala told RTL radio.

Families sue US over deadly boat strike off Venezuela coast The families of two Trinidadian men killed in a US strike on an alleged drug-smuggling boat have filed a lawsuit against the American government. Lawyers filed the claim in Boston's federal court on behalf of relatives of Chad Joseph and Rishi Samaroo, among six men killed off the coast of Venezuela on 14 October. One of the lawyers said in a statement that the strike amounted to "lawless killings in cold blood; killings for sport and killings for theatre". The US has struck at least 36 vessels in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific since September, killing more than 120 people. The Trump administration has said it is targeting "narco-terrorists" carrying drugs that kill Americans. The US has positioned its operations as a non-international armed conflict with the alleged traffickers, but legal experts say they could be in violation of the laws governing such conflict. This lawsuit was filed on Tuesday under the Death on the High Seas Act, which allows family members to sue for wrongful deaths on the high seas, and is a statute that allows foreign citizens to sue in US courts for violating international law. The case was brought by Joseph's mother and Samaroo's sister, who say the two men did fishing and farm work in Venezuela, and were returning to Trinidad and Tobago when their boat was struck. Joseph's mother Sallycar Korasingh added that if the US government believed her son had done something wrong, "it should have arrested, charged and detained him, not murdered him". The lawsuit argues that the killings should be deemed a wrongful death because the men were not taking part in military hostilities against the US. The Pentagon has not yet responded to requests for comment. It comes after the family of a Colombian man, who was killed in a separate US strike, took their case to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.

'Crying horse' toys go viral in China ahead of Lunar New Year A frowning horse plush has become a viral bestseller ahead of Lunar New Year celebrations for the year of the horse in China. The sad-looking soft toy was originally made in error after a worker sewed a smile on the horse upside down, the owner of Happy Sister - a shop in the eastern city of Yiwu - told Reuters news agency. Zhang Huoqing had expected to have to issue a refund to the customer who bought the toy, but after an image of it started circulating online the horse began selling out. Zhang said the animal's gloomy expression was resonating with young workers in China. "A lot of customers like it, and they said it makes sense: that it suits the spirit of today's corporate slaves," Zhang said. "This crying horse really fits the reality of modern working people," she added. "People joked that the crying horse is how you look at work, while the smiling one is how you look after work." Zhang's factory has surged production to meet demand - including from other countries, according to media reports. One buyer, known online as Tuan Tuan Mami, was quoted by the South China Morning Post as saying: "This little horse looks so sad and pitiful, just like the way I feel at work. "With this crying toy in the Year of the Horse, I hope to leave all my grievances at work behind and keep only happiness." The newspaper says the horse is about 20cm (7.8in) tall and costs 25 yuan (£2.62). It is red for good luck, with a golden collar and bell around its neck, and has the phrase "money comes quickly" embroidered on its body in golden letters. Another shop owner in Yiwu, Lou Zhenxian, told Reuters she thought the toy was ugly, but "it's the kind of emotional value young people look for these days". She described young people going to work in the kind of state like the crying horse, and when you get off work "being immediately happy". "But actually if everyone chases that kind of sentiment, the young people's way of thinking, it's not quite right. I believe you should work hard when at work and be happy after work, it shouldn't be two extreme opposites," she said. Lunar New Year will be celebrated in February to usher in the year of the horse - one of 12 animals repeated in a cycle under the Chinese zodiac calendar.

A string of scandals and luxury handbags: Who is South Korea's former first lady? Two Chanel handbags, a BMW dealership and a controversial church will all be at the centre of a trial faced by South Korea's former first lady this week. Kim Keon Hee, the wife of disgraced former president Yoon Suk Yeol, was arrested in August over a raft of charges including bribery, stock manipulation, and political interference - all of which she denies. On Wednesday, less than a fortnight after her husband was sentenced to five years' in jail for abusing power and obstructing justice in relation to his failed martial law bid, Kim will receive the verdict in the first of three cases against her. Prosecutors say Kim, 52, made more than 800 million won ($552,570; £404,050) by participating in a price-rigging scheme involving the stocks of Deutsch Motors, a BMW dealer in South Korea, between October 2010 and December 2012. She is also accused of accepting luxury bags, a diamond necklace and other gifts worth up to 80m won as bribes from the controversial Unification Church in exchange for business favours, and receiving 58 free opinion polls, worth 270 million Korean won, from political broker Myung Tae-kyun before the 2022 presidential election. Wednesday's trial, which will be broadcast live from the court, marks the first time in history that a presidential spouse has been indicted while detained. But it is far from the first time Kim herself has been embroiled in controversy. Questionable credentials Before she was South Korea's first lady, Kim Keon Hee – born Kim Myeong-sin – was a businesswoman and art lover. She graduated with an art education degree from Sookmyung Women's University in 1999, but would later face repeated allegations of plagiarism over her time as a student there – leading the university to annul her degree in 2025 after its research ethics panel found her thesis was compromised. She has never commented on these allegations publicly. In 2009, she founded art exhibition company Covana Contents, for which she is still CEO and president – but in 2019 South Korean media reported that she had allegedly evaded paying taxes and received kickbacks for hosting art exhibitions. Kim, who has stood down from her role, was cleared of these charges in 2023, but the special counsel is currently re-examining the case. Then, ahead of the 2022 presidential election which her husband ultimately won, allegations emerged that Kim had submitted applications to universities and companies containing false qualifications and awards, sparking a scandal over potentially fabricated credentials. In response to these allegations, which some opposition members had sought to use as a political cudgel against Yoon, Kim issued a public apology for what she described as "exaggerations" on her resume. She further pledged that if her husband became president she would "focus solely on my role as his wife". It is her conduct while in that role, however, that has drawn some of the fiercest backlash. The handbag scandal In late-2023, spy camera footage surfaced showing Kim receiving a luxury handbag from an individual in a Seoul office in September 2022. The footage was reported to have been secretly filmed by the pastor Choi Jae-young using a camera embedded in his watch – and its publication intensified public scrutiny on both Kim and Yoon. It appeared to show Mr Choi walking to a store to purchase the greyish-blue calfskin bag, with a receipt putting its cost at 3m won ($2,200; £1,800). Mr Choi then visits Covana Contents, a company in Seoul owned by the first lady, where Ms Kim then asks the pastor: "Why do you keep bringing me these things?" South Korean law makes it illegal for public officials and their spouses to receive gifts worth more than 1m won in one go, or a total of 3m won within a fiscal year. And while the video did not explicitly show Ms Kim accepting the gift, the Korea Herald reported at the time that the presidential office confirmed receipt of the bag and said that it was "being managed and stored as a property of the government". The presidential office did not immediately respond to the coverage, further fuelling the controversy, as civic groups filed complaints with the prosecution citing potential violations of the Anti-Graft Act. This incident is one of 16 allegations looked into by the special counsel team, 12 of which were passed to police for further investigation. Wednesday's verdict, however, will focus on Kim allegedly accepting other bribes from the Unification Church, as well as her alleged involvement in Deutsch Motors stock manipulation and alleged election meddling. Kim has denied the charges - although she did admit to receiving Chanel bags, which she says she later returned without using. Prosecutors last month called for a 15-year prison term and a fine of 2 billion won, saying she had "stood above the law" and colluded with the Unification Church to undermine the "constitutionally mandated separation of religion and state". Disgrace While Kim's string of scandals cast a shadow over her husband's presidential career, it was Yoon himself who ultimately sealed his own fate as one of South Korea's most disgraced former leaders. On 16 January, Yoon was found guilty of abuse of power, falsifying documents and obstructing justice when he tried and failed to impose martial law in the country in 2024. He has also been sentenced to five years in jail. It was the first of the verdicts in four trials linked to Yoon's shock martial law decree. Although short-lived, the move triggered nationwide turmoil, sparking protests as MPs rushed to the national assembly to overturn Yoon's decision. Yoon's actions "plunged the country into political crisis", a judge said while delivering the verdict, noting that Yoon had "consistently shown no remorse". It was during a year-long probe into Yoon's failed martial law attempt that special prosecutors started investigating many of the allegations against Kim. Together, the once-powerful-couple make a historic pair: while South Korea has a history of former presidents being indicted and imprisoned, Yoon and Kim mark the first time both a former president and former first lady have been jailed.

'My prosthetic leg represents my love for this country' It was hard to miss 33-year-old model and writer Abena Christine Jon'el's appearance at a recent major fashion show in Ghana. Walking the runway with her prosthetic leg wrapped in a colourful African print her appearance made a big impact. The Ghanaian-American was hoping to make a statement about the visibility of people with disabilities, building on years of work in the US and here in Ghana of speaking out on the issue. At two years old, Abena's life became defined by a challenge most adults would struggle to face. A large tumour had appeared on her right calf, the first sign of a rare, aggressive soft-tissue cancer, rhabdomyosarcoma. Doctors presented her mother with a difficult choice: radiation, which could have left her dependent on a wheelchair, or amputation. Her mother chose the latter. "It was the best decision she could have made," Abena says today without hesitation, speaking to the BBC surrounded by friends and family at a restaurant in the Ghanaian capital, Accra. She now lives in Ghana, but she grew up in Chicago in the US. Even before she understood what cancer was, her early life was shaped by treatment and recovery. Movement became a way of measuring survival and rebuilding confidence. In a way, it was taking ownership of a body that had been through so much. But when she speaks about her younger years, it is not the cliché story of the inspirational disabled child sometimes presented in glossy campaigns: a compliant person bravely but silently triumphing against adversity. She rejects that stereotype entirely. "People imagine disabled kids as straight-A students who are sweet, quiet and perfect," she says. "I was the opposite. I was loud, I was a little black girl running around on one leg, I did not let anyone push me around, and I was struggling through school." Her disability never softened her personality, it sharpened it. And that sharpness, what she now jokingly describes as her "professionally inspirational" energy, is the very thing that would later carry her through life. In the US, she worked as a writer – initially as a poet – and then became a public speaker talking about her life experiences, in the hope of inspiring people. She wanted people to see what she was accomplishing and to "let me hold a mirror so you can see yourself and what you can accomplish if you believe". Long before she dabbled with public speaking or modelling, Abena felt a pull towards Africa, a feeling she could not articulate but could not ignore. As a young adult in the US, she immersed herself in books on the history of Africa before colonialism, particularly West Africa. The more she read, the stronger the pull became. But it was her first visit to Ghana in 2021 that changed everything. In the central region of Ghana, standing at the Assin Manso slave river site – where enslaved people were sold before travelling about 40km (25 miles) south to the coast - she experienced what she describes as "a moment that rearranged my entire understanding of myself". The weight of history met the weight of belonging, forming a sense of identity she had never felt growing up in the US. When she returned, she fell into a deep depression. "It felt like I had finally found a missing part of myself in Ghana," she says."Leaving felt like being torn away from somewhere my soul belonged." Three months later, she packed her bags and moved permanently. Ghana embraced her in ways she still struggles to describe. "I am Ghanaian by ancestry and adoption," she says with pride. Over the four years she has lived in Accra, Ghanaians have claimed her in the way only Ghana knows how, with warmth, with teasing, with family, and with names. She now lives with a Ghanaian mother who introduces her as her own daughter. "My Ghanaian identity is not pretend," she says. "It is not cosplay. It is ancestral. Like Kwame Nkrumah said: 'I am not African because I was born in Africa, but because Africa was born in me.' That is exactly what Ghana is to me." Her prosthetic leg itself is a declaration of that love. Wrapped in kente, it is as much a cultural symbol as it is a mobility aid. "It always has been, and always will be, kente," she says. "It represents my love for this country, its heritage, its pride." Living with a disability in Ghana has brought a new mission into her life, one that goes far beyond personal expression. For Abena, the difference between how disabled people are treated in the US and Ghana comes down to visibility and access. "In the States, progress is happening, slowly, imperfectly, but happening. Disabled people are being invited into more spaces," she explains. "It is still ableist, but at least there is an attempt to change the narrative." Ghana, she says, is still at the beginning of that journey. Not for lack of compassion, but for lack of representation. After her move, she continued to speak out for the rights of people with disabilities. "In Ghana, disabled people have not been widely showcased in a positive light," she says. "So stigma thrives. Negativity thrives. People do not see us in powerful or beautiful or joyful positions, they see us only in struggle." Her advocacy is built on changing that perception. Not with pity, but with visibility. With her kente prosthetic, unfiltered personality and refusal to shrink herself to fit public expectations, Abena wants Ghanaians to see disabled people as they are: ambitious, stylish, talented, complex, proud and human. "Disability is not a limitation. Having a disability is not what makes you disabled," she says. "Lack of support, lack of accessibility, that is what disables you." Her advocacy found a new stage, literally, at the 15th edition of Rhythms on the Runway, one of Africa's most celebrated annual fashion shows, which took place last month at Accra's historic Osu Castle. In the build-up to the show, Abena approached the organisers directly. She knew what her presence would mean, not just for herself, but for Ghana. She wanted to open the door to a different kind of representation, to force a conversation the country had delayed for too long. "I knew it would be a monumental moment for Rhythms on the Runway and for Ghana," she says. "If I wanted inclusivity in the industry, I had to be willing to take that first step." And she did. When she stepped onto the runway, draped in fabric and confidence, her prosthetic gleaming under the spotlights, the room shifted. What happened next became one of the most talked about moments of the night. "Her strength showed right through, speaking volumes. 'I am differently able and I have got this,'" Tourism, Culture and Arts Minister Abla Dzifa Gomashie said. "Her walk was not just a performance it was a powerful affirmation that talent, beauty, and confidence know no limitations. We are proud to have provided a platform where her light could shine so boldly," fashion show organiser Shirley Emma Tibilla said. "Abena's presence was absolutely powerful. This is what true inclusion looks like, celebrating every story, everybody, and every ability," Dentaa Amoateng, entrepreneur and founder of the Guba diaspora investment awards added. But for Abena, the significance of the evening was not the applause. It was the message. Disabled people were not just spectators that night, they were centre stage. Standing at the intersection of identity, disability, heritage and fashion, Abena represents a new way forward for Ghana, one where inclusion is not quietly suggested, but boldly demanded. Her journey from a two-year-old cancer patient to a woman reshaping how Ghana sees disability is not a story of survival, it is a story of reclamation. She reclaimed her identity, reclaimed her mobility, reclaimed her belonging and reclaimed her place in a country that, in her words, "fought for me before I even stepped foot here". Her work is far from finished. But whether she is on a runway, behind a microphone, or mentoring young amputees, one thing is constant, she refuses to dim her light. And she refuses to let others like her be dimmed either. "Ghana is my home," she says. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.
