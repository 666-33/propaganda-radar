Night of Swiss ski bar fire 'apocalyptic', woman tells Crans-Montana memorial Tragedy brought people together in Crans-Montana and brought the country to a standstill. On Friday, just down the road from the bar where 40 young people were killed by fire on New Year's Eve, church bells rang in their memory. They tolled right across Switzerland, to mark a national day of mourning. Then, moments after the last notes of a special memorial service had faded, came the news that one of the bar's owners had been detained. Swiss prosecutors said Jacques Moretti, a French national, was a potential flight risk. He and his wife Jessica, who is also French, are suspected of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence. Many of the victims' families had demanded action like this from the start: more than a week after the fire, the anger in this community has been increasing. At the main ceremony in Martigny, down in the valley, relatives of the dead were joined by survivors. Some had come from hospital for the memorial. People held white roses in their laps and gripped each other's hands for support. "The images we faced were unbearable. A scene worse than a nightmare. Screams ringing out in the icy cold, the smell of burning. It was apocalyptic," a young woman called Marie told the audience. She had been in a bar opposite Le Constellation when the fire broke out and suddenly found herself helping the injured as they ran from the flames. She said she would never forget what she'd seen. Listening in the front row were the presidents of France and Italy, whose citizens were among those killed and injured in the fire. Both countries have opened their own investigations. Back in Rome, Italy's prime minister vowed to make sure all those responsible were identified. "This was no accident. It was the result of too many people who did not do their jobs," Giorgia Meloni said. She wants to know why the music wasn't cut as soon as the fire started. "Why did no-one tell the young people to get out? Why did the council not make the proper checks? There are too many whys." In Crans-Montana people have the same questions and many more. For now, the only two formal suspects are the co-owners of Le Constellation, Jacques and Jessica Moretti. Early on Friday, the pair were called in by prosecutors. They are being investigated for causing death and injury through negligence but have not been charged. Now Jacques Moretti has been remanded in custody. In a statement, the public ministry said the move followed a "new assessment of the flight risk." "I constantly think of the victims and of the people who are struggling," his wife told a crush of TV cameras after several hours of questioning at the ministry. It was her first public comment since the fire. "It is an unimaginable tragedy. It happened in our establishment, and I would like to apologise." Nine days on, Le Constellation is still obscured from view behind white plastic sheets. A lone policeman stands guard, his face covered against the relentless snow. What unfolded inside the building's basement has gradually become clearer – and it's the story of a disaster that should never have happened. Mobile phone footage shows a sparkler tied to a champagne bottle apparently starting the fire as it brushes the ceiling. Covered with soundproofing foam that was never safety tested, it ignites quickly. When the crowd eventually rush for the exit in panic, there is a crush on the stairs. It seems the emergency doors were blocked. But another video, from six years ago, suggests the risk was well known. On the footage, a waiter can be heard warning that the material on the ceiling is flammable. "Be careful with the foam," the voice shouts, as people wave the same sparklers. But the questions here are not just for the owners. This week the local authorities in Crans made the shocking admission that they hadn't carried out mandatory safety checks of the bar for five years. They offered no explanation. "It was a hell inside that bar. More than 1,000 degrees of temperature. There was no way to escape," Italy's ambassador to Switzerland, Gian Lorenzo Cornado, told the BBC, citing a long list of safety violations. Six Italians were killed as a result. "Italy wants justice, the Italian government wants justice and the Italian people want justice, for sure. The families want justice," the ambassador stressed. That includes for those with life-changing injuries. The regional hospital in Sion took the first major influx of patients. The stress was compounded by the fact that many doctors' own children were partying in Crans for the New Year. "They were all scared the next stretcher to arrive would be carrying their own child," hospital director Eric Bonvin remembers. But he's proud of how his team coped. Some casualties were unconscious and so badly burned, it took time to identify them. The most serious cases were moved to specialist burns centres elsewhere in Switzerland and in Europe where some are still in a critical condition. All face a long, tough path to recovery which the doctor likens to a "rebirth" because many of his young patients have severe burns to the face. "First the body needs to be protected, like the foetus in a mother's womb. That's what's happening for many now. Then they will have to re-enter the world and find their identity," Professor Bonvin says. "It will take a lot of work and resilience." Add to that the anguish of surviving. "They came round and at first they felt lucky to be alive. But some now feel this guilt, wondering why they are here, but not their friend or brother," Bonvin explains. "It is a delicate moment." In central Crans, the heap of tributes for the dead is still growing, protected from the elements by a canvas. After leaving their own fresh flowers on Friday, many people then stood in front of the ruins of the bar itself for a moment. Remembering, in silence.

Trump seeks $100bn for Venezuela oil, but Exxon boss says country 'uninvestable' US President Donald Trump has asked for at least $100bn (£75bn) in oil industry spending for Venezuela, but received a lukewarm response at the White House as one executive warned the South American country was currently "uninvestable". Bosses of the biggest US oil firms who attended the meeting acknowledged that Venezuela, sitting on vast energy reserves, represented an enticing opportunity. But they said significant changes would be needed to make the region an attractive investment. No major financial commitments were immediately forthcoming. Trump has said he will unleash the South American nation's oil after US forces seized its leader Nicolas Maduro in a 3 January raid on its capital. "One of the things the United States gets out of this will be even lower energy prices," Trump said in Friday's meeting at the White House. But the oil bosses present expressed caution. Exxon's chief executive Darren Woods said: "We have had our assets seized there twice and so you can imagine to re-enter a third time would require some pretty significant changes from what we've historically seen and what is currently the state." "Today it's uninvestable." Venezuela has had a complicated relationship with international oil firms since oil was discovered in its territory more than 100 years ago. Chevron is the last remaining major American oil firm still operating in the country. A handful of companies from other countries, including Spain's Repsol and Italy's Eni, both of which were represented at the White House meeting, are also active. Trump said his administration would decide which firms would be allowed to operate. "You're dealing with us directly. You're not dealing with Venezuela at all. We don't want you to deal with Venezuela," he said. The White House has said it is working to "selectively" roll back US sanctions that have restricted sales of Venezuelan oil. Officials say they have been coordinating with interim authorities in the country, which is currently led by Maduro's former second-in-command, Vice-President Delcy Rodríguez. But they have also made clear they intend to exert control over the sales, as a way to maintain leverage over Rodríguez's government. The US this week has seized several oil tankers carrying sanctioned crude. American officials have said they are working to set up a sales process, which would deposit money raised into US-controlled accounts. "We are open for business," Trump said. Venezuela's oil production has been hit in recent decades by disinvestment and mismanagement - as well as US sanctions. At roughly one million barrels per day, the country accounts for less than 1% of global supply. Chevron, which accounts for about a fifth of the country's output, said it expected to bolster its production, building on its current presence, while Exxon said it was working to send in a technical team to assess the situation in the coming weeks. Repsol, which currently boasts output of about 45,000 barrels per day, said it saw a path to triple its production in Venezuela over the next few years under the right conditions. Executives at other firms also said Trump's promises of change would encourage investment and they were hoping to seize the moment. "We are ready to go to Venezuela," said Bill Armstrong, who leads an independent oil and gas driller. "In real estate terms, it is prime real estate." But analysts say meaningfully increasing production would take significant effort. "They are being as polite as humanly possible, and being as supportive as they can, without committing actual dollars," said David Goldwyn, president of the energy consultancy Goldwyn Global Strategies and former US state department special envoy for international energy affairs. Exxon and Shell are "not going to invest single-digit billions of dollars, much less tens of billions of dollars", without physical security, legal certainty and a competitive fiscal framework, Goldwyn said. "It's not really welcome from an industry point of view," he said. "The conditions are just not right." While smaller companies might be more eager to jump in and help boost Venezuela's oil production over the next year, he said those investments would likely hover in the $50m range - far from the "fantastical" $100bn figure that Trump has floated. Rystad Energy estimates it would take $8bn to $9bn in new investments per year for production to triple by 2040. Trump's suggested $100bn of investment into Venezuela could have a major impact on production - if it were to materialise, said the firm's chief economist, Claudio Galimberti. He said companies would only be likely to invest on that scale with subsidies - and political stability. Americans should not expect the situation in Venezuela to lower oil prices anytime soon, he added. "It's going to be difficult to see big commitments before we have a fully stabilised political situation and that is anybody's guess when that happens," he said.

### 3. [One dead, dozens trapped after giant landfill collapses in Philippines](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c17zqz5pprwo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

One dead, dozens trapped after giant landfill collapses in Philippines A mountain of rubbish collapsed at a landfill in the central Philippines on Thursday, killing a 22-year-old woman and leaving more than 30 people missing, authorities have said. Rescuers pulled 12 injured sanitation workers from debris at the Binaliw Landfill in Cebu City, who were later hospitalised. Many of the missing are believed to be workers at the landfill. The mayor of Cebu told news outlet ABS-CBN that it may be difficult to reach survivors because of the potential for further collapse. The cause of the collapse is still unclear, but Cebu City councillor Joel Garganera said it was likely the result of poor waste management practices. Some 300 people from various government agencies and civilian groups have been deployed to the privately-owned landfill. Several excavators, ambulances and fire trucks have also been seen on site. "All response teams remain fully engaged in search and retrieval efforts to locate the remaining missing persons," Cebu Mayor Nestor Archival said in a Facebook post on Friday. "This is not like other landslides that you can just excavate. If you pull from the top, the bottom is soft. Let's say there is a person there, when you get the debris, it might get worse," he said, ABS-CBN reported. Cebu City councillor Joel Garganera said the incident may have happened suddenly, but was likely a result of poor waste management practices. Operators had been cutting into the mountain, mining the soil, and then piling garbage to form another mountain of waste, Garganera told local newspaper The Freeman. "It's not a sanitary landfill. It's already an open dumpsite," he said. Families are waiting for updates on their loved ones trapped in the debris. One Binaliw resident, Belen Antigua, told Rappler that her son had survived the landslide but she was still waiting for her other relatives to be found. Another said that families had been gathered at the landfill to look for their children since Friday morning. "I could not understand my emotions. They said those trapped are calling for help, so there is a possibility that my brother is still there," Michelle Lumapas, whose brother works at the landfill, told ABS-CBN. The Binaliw landfill is about 15 hectares (37 acres). Landfills are common in major Philippine cities like Cebu, which is the trading centre and transportation gateway of the Visayas, the archipelago nation's central islands.

**Excerpt**

Romance and parenthood feel remote in Ukraine: 'I haven't had a date since before the war' Sitting in a wine bar in Kyiv on a Saturday night, Daria, 34, opens a dating app, scrolls, then puts her phone away. After spending more than a decade in committed relationships she's been single for a long time. "I haven't had a proper date since before the war," she says. Four years of war have forced Ukrainians to rethink nearly every aspect of daily life. Increasingly that includes decisions about relationships and parenthood – and these choices are, in turn, shaping the future of a country in which both marriage and birth rates are falling. Millions of Ukrainian women who left at the start of the 2022 full-scale invasion have now built lives and relationships abroad. Hundreds of thousands of men are absent too, either deployed in the army or living outside the country. For those women who stayed, the prospect of meeting somebody to start a family feels increasingly remote. Khrystyna, 28, says it's noticeable that there are fewer men around. She lives in the western city of Lviv and has been trying to meet a partner through dating apps without much luck. "Many, I would say most [men] are afraid to go out now, in this situation," she says, raising her eyebrows. She is referring to the men of fighting age who spend most of their time indoors to avoid the conscription squads roaming the streets of Ukraine's cities. As for soldiers, "many are traumatised now because most of them – if they have returned – were in places where they experienced a lot", she says. Daria feels much the same. "I only see three options here," she says, listing the types of men she believes are available to women like her. First are those trying to avoid conscription. Someone who can't leave the house is probably "not a person you want to build a relationship with", Daria says. Then there are soldiers, forced into long-distance relationships with sporadic visits from the front line. With them, Daria warns, "you build a connection, then he leaves". The remaining option, she adds, are men under the conscription age of 25. But those aged 22 and under can still leave the country freely, and Daria says they could take off at any moment. None of these appeal to her. Closer to the front line, many men on active duty are also shelving the idea of starting a a relationship. Uncertainty, they say, makes long-term commitments feel irresponsible. Ruslan, a soldier serving in the Kharkiv region, knows the promises he can make are limited. Beyond visits once or twice a year, flower deliveries and the odd phone call, he asks, "what can I actually offer a girl right now?" "Promising a wife or a fiancée any long-term plans is difficult," says Denys, a 31-year-old drone operator, in a voice message sent from his position in the east of the country. "Every day there is a risk of being killed or injured, and then all plans will, so to speak, go nowhere." The consequences of this disruption threaten to ripple far into Ukraine's future. In many ways, they already have. Since the start of the invasion, the number of marriages has decreased sharply from 223,000 in 2022 to 150,000 in 2024. Ukraine has also seen deaths increase, enormous emigration – more than six million people have left the country since 2022, according to an UN estimate – and a stark decline in birth rates. These all lead to a dramatic drop in population, which in turn shrinks the workforce and slows economic growth. Oleksandr Hladun, a demographer at Ukraine's National Academy of Sciences, describes these trends as the "social catastrophe of war". And this follows Ukraine's population declining between 1992 and 2022, from 52 million to 41 million, due to a high mortality rate, migration and a decline in birth rates. Birth rates have dropped even lower during the conflict. In 2022, numbers were partly sustained by pregnancies from 2021, Hladun told Ukrainian media earlier this year. In 2023, some couples had children in the hope the war would end. But in 2024, when it became clear peace was not imminent, the birth rate fell sharply. It now stands at 0.9 children per woman, a record low, and far below the 2.1 children needed to maintain the population (for comparison, the total fertility rate in the EU is 1.38). While a decline in births is to be expected during war, Hladun says, it is generally followed by a peacetime compensatory increase thanks to those who postponed having children. But this effect is limited, usually lasting up to five years – too short a time to have a significant effect on Ukraine's bleak long-term prospects. "The longer a war lasts, the smaller this compensatory effect becomes," Hladun adds, because couples who put off having children during the conflict no longer get the chance to do so. "And for us it has already been four years, which is quite a long period." According to the National Academy of Sciences, the effects of the war will last well beyond the end of hostilities – which, in any case, is not in sight. The result, it says, could be a population of 25.2 million people by 2051, less than half what it was in 1992. Even committed couples suffer from the uncertainty of war. Olena, 33, has come to a fertility clinic on the outskirts of Lviv for a check-up. She is a policewoman and military instructor who is currently freezing her eggs, as health issues have made it difficult for her and her husband to conceive. At some point, Olena says, they will try IVF – though only while "taking into account my work and the situation in the country". Olena remembers life before the war as beautiful and "full of hope". But her dreams of starting a family were put on hold by the start of the invasion in 2022. "During the first year of the war, it felt as if everything had stopped," she says. "Everything we were striving for – building a home, planning children – nothing mattered anymore." Those fears haven't disappeared, even in Lviv, which like other parts of western Ukraine has, comparatively, been spared the worst of Russia's attacks. But for Olena, the question of having children now carries a sense of duty. "I am doing this both for myself, and for my family, and for Ukraine," she says. Soldiers on the front line, she believes, also die for the sake of unborn Ukrainian children. On the other side of the desk, Olena's gynaecologist and clinic director Dr Liubov Mykhailyshyn listens. She is proud to help "strong, nice women" like Olena, she says. But her big concern is the way the war is affecting the fertility of young Ukrainians. She worries about years of chronic stress and sleepless nights – as well as the additional physical and psychological trauma for those on the front line. All of these, she says, can cause fertility problems, which could have an impact on birth rates in the years to come. "We are waiting for it," Mykhailyshyn says of the demographic crisis ahead. Olena nods. Recently, the Ukrainian government developed strategies aimed at tackling the problem, including affordable childcare and housing. These policies, however, rely on local authorities rather than centralised funding – meaning projects often don't take off, according to Hladun. And as long as would-be mothers and children remain exposed to the dangers of war, state-level efforts might not find much success, he concedes. Ukraine now has 17 million fewer people than when it gained independence after the fall of the Soviet Union. Only a return of a substantial proportion of the 6.5 million Ukrainians who live abroad could boost figures quickly. Yet even when the fighting stops, it is unclear how many will come back. People will be more willing to return if Ukraine is able to regain most of the territory seized by Russia since 2014, Hladun suggests. But anything short of that could leave Ukrainians feeling vulnerable as it would be considered a temporary ceasefire rather than a complete end of hostilities. Despite insistence from Moscow that it does not wish to take over the whole of Ukraine, many Ukrainians are convinced that Russia poses an existential risk to their country – and one that will outlast Russian President Vladimir Putin. In this context, Ukraine's population decline should be seen as a security threat, says Hladun. "Russia is simply demographically much larger," he argues. "And in this sense, it has more resources for war." The longer the war continues, the more the uncertainty will dent the country's prospects for long-term recovery. "Planning a future feels fragile, almost naive," Daria says. "This uncertainty is painful, but it becomes a part of everyday life. "I've come to accept that I might stay alone not because I want to, but because war reshapes what feels possible," she adds. "Learning to live with that is, in itself, a form of survival."

South Africa's strained ties with US face new test - war games with China, Iran and Russia The participation of warships from China, Iran and Russia in military exercises hosted by South Africa could further strain the country's relationship with the US, which are already at an all-time low. A News24 report suggesting South Africa is hoping to persuade Iran to become an observer rather than an active participant points to the sensitivities over how the war games may be viewed by US President Donald Trump. Vessels flying Chinese, Iranian and Russian flags have been seen sailing into South Africa's main naval base in Simon's Town on the Cape Peninsula in recent days. The week-long drill got under way on Friday. It is being led by China - and involves other members from an alliance of major developing countries, which when it was launched in 2006 was known as Bric. It took its acronym from its founding members Brazil, Russia, India and China - and when South Africa joined four years later an "s" was added to its name. With the recent addition of Egypt, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) the alliance is now called Brics+ - and its aim is to challenge the political and economic power of the wealthier Western nations. South Africa's defence department said the navies were gathering "for an intensive programme of joint maritime safety operations, interoperability drills and maritime protection serials". It did not specify which nations would be taking part, only that the aim of the training was "to ensure the safety of shipping and maritime economic activities". Some commentators have questioned why Brics+ members are carrying out military exercises together, given the grouping is an economic alliance. "There are members of Brics+ that are diametrically opposed to each other politically and even have hot border skirmishes between them," defence analyst Dean Wingrin told the BBC. It is not the first time South Africa has had naval exercises with China and Russia. The first was called "Mosi", which means "smoke" in South Africa's Tswana language, and took place in 2019 with little fanfare. But by the time Mosi II took place in 2023, Russia had launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the timing of the exercise was heavily criticised. "It fell straight over the first-year anniversary of the Russian invasion," says Wingrin. "So it raised eyebrows because of the timing." The current exercise was initially scheduled to take place in November last year and was going to be called Mosi III. But it was postponed because of the G20 leaders' summit that South Africa hosted for the first time - and has been subject to a name change and the invitation broadened. "Around the middle of last year, we started hearing that it was no longer called Mosi III, but that it was now going to be a Brics+ maritime exercise called 'Will for Peace'," Wingrin says. But in the current political climate this expansion could further alienate South Africa from the US, one of its main trading partners. "South Africa has been under pressure since the Trump administration came back into power. And even before that, when the Democrats were in power, they also perceived South Africa as anti-American," William Gumede, a professor at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, told the BBC. And the fallout with the Trump administration has been spectacular. He accused the South African authorities of failing to protect its white minority population and offered Afrikaners (who are mainly descended from Dutch settlers), refugee status in the US. He then imposed higher tariffs and removed aid to South Africa. His anger was also partly fuelled by Pretoria's role in bringing a case against Israel to the International Court of Justice (ICJ). The US ally has strongly rejected the allegation of genocide against Palestinians in Gaza as "baseless". But overtures by Pretoria and South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa's visit in May to the White House, with a delegation that included famous white South African golf players, failed to mend fences. Instead Ramaphosa was ambushed in the Oval Office with a series of contested claims about the killings of white farmers in South Africa. None of South Africa's political parties have said that there is a white genocide in the country. That includes parties that represent Afrikaners and the white community in general. Yet Trump repeated such claims when he decided to boycott November's G20 summit, which was held in Johannesburg, saying it was a "total disgrace" that Africa's largest economy was hosting it. "Afrikaners are being killed and slaughtered, and their land and farms are being illegally confiscated," he posted on his social media platform Truth Social. Gumede points out that the South African economy, which has been struggling for years, needs access to the US market. "We cannot afford to alienate the US. If we add the contribution of the US state, the American private sector as well as US civil society to the South African economy, it is much higher than China's," he says. "US companies in South Africa alone produce more than 500,000 jobs. If you look at all the Chinese companies in South Africa, saying they create 10,000 jobs, or even 20,000 jobs, would be a generous estimate." This differs from government figures released in 2024, which said China had created around 400,000 jobs in South Africa. "I think the US is much more strategic to us in real terms than China," Gumede says. Last year the central bank warned that the US's new 30% tariffs on South African exports could lead to around 100,000 job losses, with the agriculture and automotive sectors hardest-hit. Gumede explained that the African National Congress (ANC), the party that brought liberation to South Africa in 1994, sees China as an ideological partner. Russia too is respected for its role in supporting the ANC's struggle against the apartheid regime and white-minority rule. But the ANC has failed to update its foreign policy to encompass its new coalition partners after losing its parliamentary majority in 2024, he says. It was forced to enter a governing coalition including parties such as the pro-business, Western-aligned Democratic Alliance (DA). "When it was a majority party, China was a strategic partner for the ANC government. But now we are in a government of national unity, so what we should have done, as a country and as a government, is to come up with a new foreign policy which is inclusive of the ANC's partners, because the ANC is not a majority partner any more." The DA, the second largest party in the country, has heavily criticised the Will for Peace naval exercise. In a statement, its defence spokesperson Chris Hattingh said it undermined South Africa's non-aligned foreign policy stance. "This exercise is being led by China and includes participation by Russia and Iran, both heavily sanctioned and both involved in active conflicts. "Hosting and training with such forces cannot be described as neutral or non-aligned. It is a political choice, whether the government admits it or not." But Wingrin says there may also have been practical considerations behind the South African military's decision to go ahead. "South Africa is in a difficult position because years of defunding the defence force and of cutting its budget has left our defence capabilities decimated," he says. "We don't have as many ships capable of going to sea to go to other countries to exercise. So we have to take every opportunity we can to exercise with any country that's willing to come to South Africa." South Africa deputy Defence Minister Bantu Holomisa has also shrugged off the criticism, saying it is an honour for the country's defence forces "to practise with well-equipped countries in military terms" and it will boost the morale of troops. However, Wingrin warns it could spell trouble: "I don't believe this exercise will result in any military action from any other country. "But it may certainly make South African trade negotiations more difficult with certain countries. It's not the exercise per se, it's all about the optics." A view echoed by other commentators, like Gumede: "This definitely will be seen as a provocation by the Trump administration. "This is not a good look for South Africa given the current geopolitics. I think it would have been best for President Ramaphosa to cancel these joint naval exercises." Political analyst Sandile Swana, however, is more sanguine, even in the light of the recent US military operation to remove President Nicolás Maduro from power and its seizure of oil tankers leaving the South American country. "The objective of the exercise is to make the seas safe for international trade, to combat piracy and to create a safe maritime environment. I think by any standards that would be welcome by anybody," he told the BBC, adding that relations between the US and South African cannot get much worse. "I cannot see any credible reason why the call for safe maritime activities should be curtailed by anyone. Trump has been issuing extreme threats and then turning his back on them just as quickly as he's made them." For Gumede it is the economic impact of the rift that should be the focus. "We are in real danger, if we don't make our foreign policy more reconciliatory towards the US or more pragmatic, we will be squeezed between the fights between the US and China, the US and Iran, as well as the US and Russia. "And South Africa will be the biggest loser." You may also be interested in: Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.
