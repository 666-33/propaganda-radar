US military strikes Islamic State group targets in Syria, officials say The US and its partner forces have carried out large-scale strikes against Islamic State (IS) group targets in Syria, the US Central Command (Centcom) has announced. US President Donald Trump directed the strikes on Saturday, which are part of Operation Hawkeye Strike, in retaliation to the IS group's deadly attack on US forces in Syria on 13 December, Centcom wrote on X. The strikes were conducted in an effort to combat terrorism and protect US and partner forces in the region, according to Centcom. "Our message remains strong: if you harm our warfighters, we will find you and kill you anywhere in the world, no matter how hard you try to evade justice," Centcom said. The US and its partner forces fired more than 90 precision munitions at more than 35 targets in an operation that involved more than 20 aircraft, an official told CBS News, the BBC's US partner. The official added that aircraft including F-15Es, A-10s, AC-130Js, MQ-9s and Jordanian F-16s had taken part in the strikes. The location of the strikes and the extent of any casualties is not yet clear. "We will never forget, and never relent," Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth wrote on X on Saturday in reference to the military action. The Trump administration first announced Operation Hawkeye Strike in December after an IS gunman killed two US soldiers and a US civilian interpreter in an ambush in Palmyra, located in the centre of Syria. "This is not the beginning of a war - it is a declaration of vengeance," Hegseth said when announcing the operation in December. "The United States of America, under President Trump's leadership, will never hesitate and never relent to defend our people." Prior to the latest strikes on Saturday, US forces killed or captured nearly 25 IS group members in 11 missions between 20 December and 29 December as part of Operation Hawkeye Strike, Centcom said. In the operation's first mission on 19 December, US and Jordanian forces carried out a "massive strike" against the IS group, deploying fighter jets, attack helicopters and artillery to strike "more than 70 targets at multiple locations across central Syria", according to Centcom. That operation, it said, "employed more than 100 precision munitions" targeting known IS infrastructure and weapons sites.

Dozens arrested and one police officer injured in Minneapolis protests At least 29 people have been arrested in Minneapolis during protests over the death of a woman who was shot by a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent. One police officer was also injured after a "chunk of ice was thrown at them", city officials said, during demonstrations which saw 1,000 people take to the streets of the city on Friday night. Protests against immigration enforcement have been held across the US after 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good was shot in her car on Wednesday. The Trump administration said the agent who fired the shots acted in self-defence. Local officials have insisted the woman posed no danger. Minneapolis Police declared an unlawful assembly on Friday night as protesters gathered outside the Canopy Hotel in the city, where some ICE agents were believed to be staying. The Minneapolis police department said in a statement that "some individuals forced entry into the hotel through an alley entrance". Videos posted online showed protesters flashing bright lights into the area, blowing whistles and banging on drums. Police said there were "well over 1,000" demonstrators in the area and some threw ice, snow and rocks at officers, police vehicles and other vehicles, but no serious injuries were reported. One law enforcement officer suffered minor injuries but did not need any medical attention, according to the BBC's US partner CBS News. Officials said another hotel in the city was also targeted and had window and graffiti damage. At a news conference on Saturday, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey applauded the majority of protesters who he said have been peaceful, but noted that individuals who cause damage to property or put others in harm's way would be arrested. The 29 people arrested on Friday night were later released, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said. O'Hara said that by 01:00 local time (07:00 GMT), the crowd had been dispersed, and his officers deployed a "disciplined and restrained response". Many Minnesotans have been frustrated by the presence of ICE in the state and O'Hara said his department was getting dozens of phone calls every day about the federal agency's operations. On Saturday, three congresswomen from Minnesota also attempted to tour an ICE facility in Minneapolis. The women said they were initially allowed to enter, but were then told they had to leave. Democratic Congresswomen Ilhan Omar, Kelly Morrison and Angie Craig said ICE and the Department of Homeland Security were obstructing members of Congress from fulfilling their duty to oversee operations there. "They do not care that they are violating federal law," Craig said. "The public deserves to know what is taking place in ICE facilities," Omar posted on X. Further protests are planned in Minneapolis this weekend, as well as in Texas, Florida, Washington DC and elsewhere in the US, according to Indivisible, an organisation that formed to resist the Trump administration. Good was shot and killed in her car on Wednesday. Videos of the incident show ICE agents approaching a car which is in the middle of the street, and telling the woman behind the wheel to get out of the SUV. One of the agents tugs at the driver's side door handle. As the vehicle attempts to drive off, one of the agents at the front of the car points their gun at the driver and several shots are heard. The car then continues to drive away from the officer and crashes into the side of the street. Good's wife told local media the pair had gone to the scene of immigration enforcement activity to support neighbours. The officer who fired on Good is Jonathan Ross, a veteran ICE agent who was previously injured in the line of duty when he was struck by a car. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has claimed the ICE agent shot Good multiple times because she was trying to run over the officer in her car. But Democratic Minneapolis Mayor Frey called that version of events a false narrative, saying it was clear to him she was trying to leave the scene, not attack an agent. The FBI is investigating the incident. On Friday, Minnesota officials said they would open an inquiry into the shooting after saying they had been frozen out of the federal investigation. The announcement came a day after the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said the FBI had initially pledged a joint investigation, then reversed course. The US vice-president said the investigation was a federal issue.

Author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's family accuse hospital of negligence over son's death The family of Nigerian novelist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie has accused a hospital of negligence over the death of her 21-month-old son. Nkanu Nnamdi died at a hospital in Nigeria on Wednesday following a short illness, leaving the family of the acclaimed postcolonial feminist writer "devastated". Now, the family allege there was a litany of failures at Euracare Hospital in Lagos that led to the toddler's death, including being denied oxygen and being given too much sedation, causing a heart attack. The hospital expressed its "deepest sympathies" over the loss of the child but denied improper care, which it said had been in line with international standards. It added that Nkanu had arrived at the hospital "critically ill" and that an investigation into the death was now under way. Adichie's sister-in-law, Dr Anthea Nwandu, made a series of allegations about the hospital in an interview with Nigerian broadcaster Arise TV on Saturday. In it, she said the medical director of Euracare had told Adichie her son "had received too much sedation", which subsequently caused him to have a heart attack. Dr Nwandu also accused medical staff of leaving the child unattended, denying him oxygen and transporting him in a manner that was "not according to standard practice". She alleged Nkanu suffered a brain injury due to lack of oxygen. Similar accusations concerning Nkanu's care were made in a private message from Adichie that was leaked online. Her spokeswoman Omawumi Ogbe told the BBC that the message had originally been shared within "a close circle of family and friends", and "was not for public consumption". Ms Ogbe continued: "While we are saddened that such a deeply personal account of grief and trauma was leaked, the details therein highlight the devastating clinical failures the family is now forced to confront. "We hope that the substance of that message, detailing the gross medical negligence that led to this tragedy remains the central focus even as we look forward to the truth and accountability." Nkanu was one of twin boys Adichie shared with her husband, Dr Ivara Esege. Responding to the allegations, Euracare Hospital acknowledged the "profound and unimaginable loss" the family was experiencing, but said in a statement on Saturday that "reports currently being circulated contain inaccuracies". It said Nkanu, who was critically ill, had been referred to the hospital after receiving treatment from two paediatric centres, and that upon arrival staff "immediately provided care in line with established clinical protocols and internationally accepted medical standards, including the administration of sedation". It continued: "In the course of his care, we worked collaboratively with external medical teams as recommended by his family and ensured that all necessary clinical support was provided." However, "despite these concerted efforts", the boy died less than 24 hours after arriving at the hospital, it added. A "detailed investigation" was under way, Euracare said, adding that it remained "committed to engaging transparently and responsibly with all clinical and regulatory processes". Adichie, 48, had her first child, a daughter, in 2016. Her twin boys were born using a surrogate in 2024. The award-winning US-based writer is known for works including Half of a Yellow Sun, Americanah and her 2012 Ted Talk and essay We Should All Be Feminists, which was sampled by Beyoncé on her 2013 song Flawless. Nigeria's president was among those to have expressed their condolences over the death of Nkanu. The African nation's health system has suffered of late from a severe shortage of doctors, leaving healthcare staff working long hours and doctors juggling jobs in both public and private hospitals. Responding to the allegations concerning Nkanu, Lagos state Ministry of Health spokeswoman Dr Kemi Ogunyemi said it "places the highest value on human life and maintains zero tolerance for medical negligence or unprofessional conduct". She confirmed the state's health watchdog had commenced a "thorough, indepedent and transparent" investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death. "Any individual or institution found culpable of negligence, professional misconduct, or regulatory violations will face the full wrath of the law," Dr Ogunyemi said. She urged members of the public to avoid speculation over the death while the official investigation was ongoing.

**Excerpt**

Rare first Superman comic once stolen from Nicolas Cage sells for $15m A rare copy of the 1938 comic that introduced Superman to the world has sold to an anonymous collector for $15m (£11.2m). The private sale of the Action Comics No 1 copy - once stolen from actor Nicolas Cage's home and returned to him over a decade later - was announced on Friday. The previous record for the sale of a comic book was set in November, when a pristine Superman No 1 fetched $9.12m at auction. Both sales far exceed the original 10-cent price tags - or around $2.25 in today's money. Superman's debut is one of several tales anthologised in Action Comics No 1, which is widely credited with having defined the superhero genre as we now know it. Fewer than 100 copies are thought to exist. Friday's Action Comics sale was negotiated by New York-based Metropolis Collectibles/Comic Connect, which said both the comic book's owner and the buyer wished to remain anonymous. The broker said the copy had been graded nine out of a possible 10 points by the Certified Guaranty Company, which specialises in authenticating collectables - making it the joint-highest scoring copy of the comic to date. The broker said its value was further inflated by its storied association with Hollywood star Cage The Con Air and National Treasure star purchased this particular copy in 1996 for $150,000 - a record at the time. But the comic was stolen during a party at Cage's home in 2000 and only found - inside a storage unit in California - in 2011. "During that 11-year period, it skyrocketed in value. The thief made Nicolas Cage a lot of money by stealing it," said Metropolis/ComicConnect CEO Stephen Fishler. Cage was reunited with the copy and, six months later, sold it at auction for $2.2m. Fishler compared the comic's history to the brazen theft of Leonardo Da Vinci's Mona Lisa from the Louvre museum in Paris in 1911, which transformed the then little-known work to the world's most famous painting. "The recovery of the painting made the Mona Lisa go from being just a great Da Vinci painting to a world icon - and that's what Action No 1 is. An icon of American pop culture."

Trump says US needs to 'own' Greenland to prevent Russia and China from taking it President Donald Trump says the US needs to "own" Greenland to prevent Russia and China from doing so. "Countries have to have ownership and you defend ownership, you don't defend leases. And we'll have to defend Greenland," Trump told reporters on Friday, in response to a question from the BBC. The US will do it "the easy way" or "the hard way", he added. The White House recently said the administration was considering buying the semi-autonomous territory of fellow Nato member Denmark, but it would not rule out the option of annexing it by force. Denmark and Greenland say the territory is not for sale. Denmark has said military action would spell the end of the trans-Atlantic defence alliance. Greenland's party leaders, including the opposition, reiterated their call for the "US's disregard for our country to end" in a joint statement on Friday night. "We do not want to be Americans, we do not want to be Danes, we want to be Greenlanders," they said. "The future of Greenland must be decided by the Greenlandic people." Despite being the most sparsely populated territory, Greenland's location between North America and the Arctic makes it well placed for early warning systems in the event of missile attacks, and for monitoring vessels in the region. The US president has repeatedly said that Greenland is vital to US national security, claiming without evidence that it was "covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place". The US already has more than 100 military personnel permanently stationed at its Pituffik base in Greenland's north-western tip - a facility that has been operated by the US since World War Two. Under existing agreements with Denmark, the US has the power to bring as many troops as it wants to Greenland. But Trump told reporters in Washington that a lease agreement was not good enough. "Countries can't make nine-year deals or even 100-year deals," he said, adding that they had to have ownership. "I love the people of China. I love the people of Russia," Trump said. "But I don't want them as a neighbour in Greenland, not going to happen. "And by the way, Nato's got to understand that." Denmark's Nato allies - major European countries as well as Canada - have rallied to its support this week with statements reaffirming that "only Denmark and Greenland can decide on matters concerning their relations". Stressing they were as keen as the US on Arctic security, they have said this must be achieved by allies, including the US, "collectively". They also called for "upholding the principles of the UN Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders". Concerns over the future of the territory resurfaced after Trump's use of military force against Venezuela on Saturday to seize its president, Nicolás Maduro. Trump previously made an offer to buy the island in 2019, during his first presidential term, only to be told it was not for sale. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio is to hold talks with Denmark next week. In recent years, there has been increased interest in Greenland's natural resources - including rare earth minerals, uranium and iron - which are becoming easier to access as its ice melts due to climate change. Scientists think it could also have significant oil and gas reserves.

'Hermès of durian': The luxury fruit cashing in on China's billion-dollar appetite Driving around Raub, a small town in Malaysia, it's impossible to miss the prickly fruit that powers its economy. You can smell it from the steady stream of trucks winding through mountain roads, leaving a faint fragrance on their trails. You can see it too: the green spikes of a giant sculpture, murals painted fondly on low walls and road signs that proclaim: "Welcome to the home of Musang King durians." A gold mining town in the 19th Century, Raub has seen its economy take on a new hue of yellow in recent years. Today it's better known as the land of the Musang King — a buttery, bittersweet variety that the Chinese have dubbed the "Hermès of durians", as prized as the French fashion house. Raub is one of many South East Asian towns that sit at the heart of a global durian rush, pumped by China's growing demand. In 2024, China imported a record $7bn (£5.2bn) worth of durians — a three-fold increase from 2020. This is where more than 90% of the world's durian exports are now headed. "Even if only 2% of Chinese people want to buy durians, that's more than enough business," says Chee Seng Wong, factory manager of Fresco Green, a durian exporter in Raub. Wong recalls how farmers cut down durian trees to make room for oil palms, the country's main cash crop, during an economic downturn in the 1990s. "Now it's the other way round. They're chopping oil palms to grow durians again." A very hungry China With an aroma that has been likened to cabbage, sulphur and sewers — depending on who the nose belongs to — the durian packs a pungence so divisive that it's banned on some public transport and hotels. It has been maligned for gas leaks, and was the reason a plane was grounded after passengers remonstrated against the smell wafting from the cargo hold. Fans from the region have christened it the "King of fruits", but on the internet it has earned a less flattering tag — the world's smelliest fruit — as tourists unused to its odour seek it out with squeamish curiosity. Yet it has found a growing fanbase in China: as an exotic gift exchanged among the affluent; a status symbol to be unboxed on social media; and the star of culinary heresies from durian chicken hotpot to durian pizza. Thailand and Vietnam are the top durian suppliers to China, accounting for nearly all of its imports. Malaysia's share of the market is sprouting fast, having earned a reputation with premium varieties such as the Musang King. The average price of durian starts at less than $2 (£1.4) in South East Asia, where they are grown in abundance. But luxe versions like the Musang King could cost anywhere from $14 (£10) to $100 (£74) a pop, depending on their quality and the season's harvest. "Once I ate Malaysian durian, my first thought was, 'Wow, this is delicious. I have to find a way to bring it to China'," says Xu Xin, who has been sampling durians at a shop in Raub. The 33-year-old sells the fruit back home in northeastern China, and is on the hunt for the best durians to import. With her are two durian exporters from southern China, one of whom says business has been booming. The other expects it to continue: "There are so many people who haven't eaten it yet. The market potential is huge." It's easy to see why they're so confident. Seated nearby is a large Chinese tour group — one of many that have been flocking to rural Malaysia for a bite of the fruit. Eagerly they dig into platters of durian, carefully arranged from the mildest to the richest. If eaten in the right order, locals say, fresh notes should emerge with each glob on the flight: caramel, custard and finally, an almost alcoholic bitterness heralding the Musang King. Such pedantry is perhaps why Malaysian durians have earned a special place on the Chinese table. "Maybe in the beginning we only liked durians that were sweet. But now we look for things like fragrance, richness and nuanced flavours," Xu says. "Nowadays there are more customers who walk into the shop and ask, 'Are there any bitter ones in this batch?'" Raub's durian dynasties Just hours before the durians ended up on Xu's plate, they were painstakingly harvested at a nearby farm owned by Lu Yuee Thing. Uncle Thing, as he's known in town, owns the durian shop, along with several farms. He is one of many success stories in Raub, where durians have made millionaires out of farmers. In family businesses like his, sons often help with transporting durians while daughters handle accounting and the finances. "Durian has contributed a lot to the economy here," Uncle Thing says. Driving to his farm one morning, there is quiet pride in his voice as he points out the Japanese pickup trucks that have replaced the rickety jeeps he used to rely on for transporting crates of his fruit. Still, farming is hard work. At 72, Uncle Thing wakes up at dawn every day and weaves around his hilly farm to collect ripened durians, either dangling from trees or nestling on nets close to the ground. A couple of years ago, a falling durian landed on his shoulder, leaving him with a throbbing pain that acts up now and then. "It looks like farmers make easy money. But it's not easy," he says. Once harvested, the durians are brought to Uncle Thing's shop, where they are sorted into baskets ranging from Grade A, for the large and round ones, to Grade C, the small and odd-shaped. Sitting in the middle of the sorting floor is a lone basket reserved for Grade AA durians, the handsomest of the lot. Those will soon be flown to China. A durian coup? China's insatiable appetite for durians has shaped up to be a nifty diplomatic tool. Beijing has signed a flurry of durian trade agreements, touting them as a celebration of bilateral ties — not just with major producers like Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia, but also budding suppliers like Cambodia, Indonesia, Philippines and Laos. "In this durian competition, everyone's a winner," declared a state media article in 2024. The deals also dovetail with China's investments in infrastructure in the region. The China-Laos Railway, launched in 2021, now transports more than 2,000 tonnes of fruit every day, most of them Thai durians. But this clamour to keep up with China's appetite comes at a cost. Food safety concerns about Thai durians erupted last year, after Chinese authorities found in them a carcinogenic chemical dye believed to make the durians more yellow. In Vietnam, many coffee farmers pivoted to durians, driving up global coffee prices that were already affected by severe weather. And in Raub, a turf war has broken out. Authorities felled thousands of durian trees they said were planted illegally on state land. Farmers say they have been using the land for decades without any issue, and allege they are now being forced to pay a lease to continue farming there, or face eviction. Meanwhile, a coup may be on the way in China's island province of Hainan, where years of trial and error are bearing fruit. Its durian harvest for 2025 was expected to reach 2,000 tonnes. Like in so many industries, from renewables to AI, China has long pushed to be self-sufficient in food too. Even as it reaps the fruits of this durian diplomacy, it is eyeing what state media calls "durian freedom". "For one thing, we won't have to rely on Thai and Vietnamese vendors when buying durians anymore!" proclaimed an article in August. That is still a distant dream. Hainan's first home-grown durians hit the market with much fanfare in 2023, but accounted for less than 1% of China's durian consumption that year. But the way Uncle Thing sees it, "Hainan has already succeeded in its experiment... If they have their own supply and start importing less, our market will be affected." He shrugs it off for now: "That is not something we can worry about. All that we can do is take good care of our farms and boost yields." Ask anyone else in Raub about Hainan's quest, and your question will be swatted away with a smug comeback: they are still no match for Malaysian durians. And yet, as China chases "durian freedom", it's hard to ignore the fact that the Musang King sits on an ever shakier throne.

Swiss search souls and question government after ski resort fire In the wake of the devastating fire at a bar in Crans-Montana, many Swiss citizens are asking themselves whether their political system is fit for purpose. Switzerland, often praised for its efficiency, has a very devolved system of government, in which villages and towns are run by local officials elected from and by the community. It is a system the Swiss cherish because they believe it ensures accountability. But there are inherent weaknesses: hypothetically, the official approving a bar licence or passing a fire-safety check is the friend, neighbour, or maybe even cousin of the bar owner. When the news of the ski resort fire emerged on New Year's Eve, first there was shock. Such devastating fires are not, people thought, supposed to happen in Switzerland. Then there was grief - 40 young people lost their lives, 116 were injured, many of them very seriously. Questions followed - what caused such a catastrophe? And finally, this week - fury, when Crans-Montana's Mayor Nicolas Feraud revealed that Le Constellation bar had not been inspected since 2019. Crans-Montana sits in the Swiss canton of Valais, where fire-safety inspections are the responsibility of Feraud and his colleagues, and are supposed to happen every 12 months. Not only had the checks not taken place, the mayor said, he had only become aware of this after the fire. And, he revealed, of 128 bars and restaurants in Crans-Montana, only 40 had been inspected in 2025. Asked why, Feraud had no answer, though he did suggest Crans-Montana had too few inspectors for the number of properties that needed checking. This was echoed by Romy Biner, mayor of neighbouring upmarket resort Zermatt, who told local media that many communities in the canton of Valais did not have the required resources to inspect so many premises. This is not a line that plays well with many Swiss, who know that Crans-Montana and Zermatt are two of the richest winter resorts in the country. So when Feraud faced the press, there were pointed questions from Swiss journalists: how well did the mayor know the bar's owners? Had he ever been to the bar? And was there any possibility of corruption? "Absolutely not," was his indignant answer to the last question. The mother of two brothers who survived the fire also had questions. "We urgently need complete, transparent answers," she wrote on social media. When they escaped the burning bar, each of her sons had thought at first that the other was dead. "They escaped, but they are deeply traumatised. They will carry the emotional scars forever." Those questions, from journalists and families, reveal the problems of Switzerland's devolved political system. 'A failure right across the board' Elected officials in towns like Crans-Montana have many responsibilities as well as fire safety - running schools and social services, even collecting taxes. Most of these officials work part-time and, once elected, continue with their day jobs. Nowadays, some communes may be over-challenged trying to supply and oversee all the services a 21st-Century population expects, but Swiss voters expect better than what they heard from Feraud. The headlines after his news conference were savage. Many demanded he and his colleagues resign. Feraud ruled this out, saying: "We were elected by the people. You don't abandon ship in the middle of a storm." "A failure right across the board," wrote the broadsheet Tagesanzeiger. "Now Switzerland's reputation is on the line." "An utter disaster," wrote the tabloid Blick, "a total failure of fire safety checks." Reputational damage is something the Swiss both hate and fear. Switzerland is a rich country, in part because of its reputation for safety, stability, reliability and, among its own citizens, accountability. If those in charge damage that reputation and put the country's success at risk, the Swiss are unforgiving. Heads rolled two decades ago when Swissair, the much-loved national airline, went bankrupt. Once nicknamed affectionately "the flying bank", Swissair's management had made a series of risky financial investments that left the airline dangerously over-extended. In 2008, banking giant UBS, in which many Swiss, especially pensioners, had shares, had to be bailed out by Swiss taxpayers to prevent not just its own downfall, but disastrous consequences for the global economy. When the bank's reckless over-exposure to subprime mortgages was revealed, there was outrage. At the bank's annual general meeting that year, normally sedate elderly shareholders hissed and booed. One even jumped onto the stage, demanding the management give up their generous bonuses, ironically waving a string of Swiss bratwursts under their noses "in case you go hungry". Crans-Montana, too, has aroused that same angry feeling of trust being betrayed. But this is much worse than Swissair or UBS. Forty people, many of them teenagers, are dead. Dozens more have suffered life-changing injuries. The Swiss authorities know there must be answers, quickly. At Friday's memorial service, the president of Valais, Matthias Reynard, was close to tears as he promised a "strict and independent" investigation, warning that "relevant political authorities" would be held accountable. Switzerland's President Guy Parmelin said he expected justice "without delay and without leniency". The owner of the bar is now in custody, subject to a criminal investigation, but the role of the local government is sure to be examined, too. There are already calls for fire-safety inspection in Valais canton to be taken away from local town councils and given to canton authorities. Romain Jourdan, a lawyer representing some of the families, has announced plans to file a case against Crans-Montana's town council. The families, he said, "are demanding that all local officials be questioned so that such a tragedy never happens again". There is a deeper, nationwide soul-searching going on as well. The Swiss want to know why their beloved devolved system, which many, perhaps complacently, believed to be near-perfect, went so catastrophically wrong. In the first hours after the fire, many people, along with their shock and grief, felt a certain quiet pride that their emergency services had responded so quickly. Firefighters, ambulances crews and even helicopters were at the scene within minutes. The emergency services were present at the memorial service. Many openly wept. The shock and grief still sits deep, but the pride has evaporated. What good are top-of-the-range, highly professional emergency services, the Swiss are asking themselves, if basic fire safety checks are neglected? Switzerland's government says finding answers is a moral responsibility - to the families above all, but also to its own voters.

**Excerpt**

Greenlanders fear for future as island embroiled in geopolitical storm US Secretary of State Marco Rubio will meet Danish and Greenlandic officials next week to discuss the fate of Greenland - a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark that President Donald Trump says he needs for national security. The vast island finds itself in the eye of a geopolitical storm with Trump's name on it and people here are clearly unnerved. Yet when you fly in, it looks so peaceful. Ice and snow-capped mountains stretch as far as the eye can see, interrupted here and there by glittering fjords - all between the Arctic and the Atlantic Oceans. It is said to sit on top of the world; much of it above the Arctic Circle. Greenland is nine times the size of the UK but it only has 57,000 inhabitants, most of them indigenous Inuit. You find the biggest cluster of Greenlanders on the south-western coast in the capital, Nuuk. We arrived there as a frozen twilight was creeping across snow-covered pedestrian streets. Parents dragged their children home from school on sledges, and students mooched their way in and out of brightly-lit malls. Few wanted to talk to us about the Trump-related angst here. Those who did sounded very gloomy. One pensioner banged his walking stick on the ground in emphasis as he told me the US must never plant its flag in Greenland's capital. A lady who said she was mistrustful of everyone these days, and didn't give her name, admitted she was "scared to death" about the prospect of Trump taking the island by force after she watched his military intervention in Venezuela. Meanwhile, 20-something pottery-maker Pilu Chemnitz said: "I think we are all very tired of the US president. We have always lived a quiet and peaceful life here. "Of course, the colonisation by Denmark caused a lot of trauma for many people but we just want to be left alone." Never mind opposing a takeover by the US, which 85% of Greenlanders say they do, most also say they favour independence from Denmark - although many tell me they appreciate the Danish subsidies that help prop up their welfare state. While rich in untapped natural resources, poverty is a real issue here in Inuit communities. Overall, Greenlanders want a bigger, louder say, not only in their domestic policies, but in foreign affairs too. I went to the island's modest-looking parliament, the body of it built in a Scandinavian style with wooden slats and painted the same burnished red as the Greenlandic flags fluttering by the entrance. No security checks. All pretty relaxed. Except for the roaring polar bear emblem - a symbol of Greenland, etched onto every sliding glass doors we pass. I was there to meet Pipaluk Lynge-Rasmussen, co-chair of the foreign affairs committee in parliament. She is an MP with the pro-independence Inuit Ataqatigiit party that is part of the coalition government here. "I think it's very important for us to speak out about what we want as a people," she told me. "We have always worked towards independence when we got home rule in 1979 and more independence in 2009." I asked Lynge-Rasmussen if she felt that big global powers - the US, Denmark, Nato, and the EU - were talking a lot about Greenland right now, rather than to the islanders about their fate. She nodded vigorously. Surprisingly, perhaps, she blames Denmark more than she blames Trump for overlooking Greenlanders' wants and needs. Even though Greenland and the Faroe Islands are part of the Kingdom of Denmark, she says, she feels they have always been treated like second-class citizens. But Lynge-Rasmussen insisted that Greenlanders should not see themselves as victims in the current situation. Instead, she suggests they use the international spotlight now on them to show off their importance and push for their priorities. What of the meeting next week with Rubio, I asked? "I hope the meeting will end with understanding and compromise," she answered. "Maybe doing business with [the US] from here… maybe co-operating on trade, or mining, having more American [military] bases on Greenland, perhaps?" Under a bilateral agreement with Denmark dating back to 1951 the US may bring as many US troops as it wants to Greenland. This has left European allies wondering out loud why Trump feels the need to "take" the island unilaterally: whether buying it - seemingly Washington's preferred option, or encouraging Greenlanders to vote in a plebiscite to become part of the US, or taking Greenland by force, something the Trump administration has refused to rule out. It wouldn't take much flexing of military muscles. Greenland has few trained soldiers and no military bases of its own. Trump and US Vice-President JD Vance justify their need to "take" Greenland because they say Denmark doesn't do enough to secure the island. Copenhagen disputes this. It's also worth noting that the US already has a military base on Greenland - and it chose to radically reduce its presence there from about 10,000 personnel during peak Cold War times to some 200 now. The US has long taken its eye off Arctic security, until recently. Trump's keen interest in the island is likely a mix of: perceived national security concerns - a hunger for the rich natural resources Greenland boasts, including rare earths and minerals - and his loudly-trumpeted desire to dominate the Americas. - Geographically Greenland is part of North America. It's closer to New York City by about 1,000 miles (1,609 km) than to Copenhagen. This should give Greenlanders pause for thought, opposition MP Pele Broberg of the Naleraq Party told me. He said people were scared of what Trump would do to Greenland because they were misinformed, largely because of media hysteria. "It's true, we are not for sale - but we are open for business. Or we should be. "Right now we are a colony. We are made to import our goods from Denmark: 4,000km away, rather than from the US which is much closer." Broberg described his organisation as the island's true independence party, pushing he says for freedom, so Greenlanders can trade, on their terms, with any party or country they choose: the US, Denmark or others. But right now, the US is making demands, rather than business deals between equals. So what exactly are the national security priorities Trump sees in Greenland? Briefly put: the shortest route for a Russian ballistic missile to reach continental US is via Greenland and the North Pole. Washington DC already has an early warning air base on the island - but Greenland could serve as a base for missile interceptors as part of the Trump administration's proposed "Golden Dome" system: a plan to shield the US from all missile attacks. The US has also reportedly discussed placing radars in waters connecting Greenland, Iceland and the UK - the so-called GIUK Gap. That's a gateway for Chinese and Russian vessels that Washington wants to track. There is no evidence to the naked eye when you are in Greenland to back Trump's recent assertions that there are lots of Chinese and Russian ships currently around the island. And last week Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian criticised Washington for "using the so-called 'China threat' as a pretext for itself to seek selfish gains" in the Arctic. But Russia and China have been expanding their military capabilities, and have beefed up their co-operation elsewhere in the region - with joint naval patrols and co-developing new shipping routes. Under pressure from western sanctions over Ukraine, Moscow is keen to ship more to Asia. Beijing is looking for shorter, more lucrative maritime routes to Europe. The northern sea route is becoming easier to navigate due to melting ice, and Greenland opened its representation office in Beijing in 2023 in pursuit of deeper ties with China. When it comes to Arctic security, Nato allies hope to persuade Washington that they are serious. UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer reportedly spoke more than once to the US president last week, telling him that Europe will step up its presence even further in the region. He's also been urging European leaders to increase their cooperation with the US there. Greenland, Denmark and their Nato allies believe there is room for negotiation with Rubio next week and that, at the very least, Trump swooping in to Greenland militarily is unlikely - though not impossible. But if the Trump administration does choose that option, it's hard to know what Europe could or would do about it. The continent still heavily relies on the US for its own security and defence, and its leaders also desperately want to keep Washington onside in talks to end the war in Ukraine. The Arctic powers geographically are Denmark, the US, Canada, Russia, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. An Arctic Council, representing them all, has long tried to maintain the mantra: high north, low tension. But military chest-beating and unilateralism from Washington over Greenland, plus a wider scramble for advantage between global superpowers, adds to a real sense of jeopardy in the region. The decades-long delicate balance in the Arctic, in place since the end of the Cold War, and even managed since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, could be dangerously upset.
