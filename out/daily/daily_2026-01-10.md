Iran medics describe overwhelmed hospitals as protests enter second week As protests in Iran entered their second week and Iranian authorities issued coordinated warnings to protesters, a doctor and medic at two hospitals told the BBC their facilities were overwhelmed with injuries. One doctor said an eye hospital in Tehran had gone into crisis mode, while the BBC also obtained a message from a medic in another hospital saying it did not have enough surgeons to cope with the influx of patients. On Friday, US President Donald Trump said Iran was in "big trouble" and warned "you better not start shooting because we'll start shooting too". Iran, in a letter to the UN Security Council, blamed the US for turning the protests into what it called "violent subversive acts and widespread vandalism". Meanwhile, international leaders called for the right to peaceful protest to be protected. Anti-government protests have taken place in dozens of cities, with at least 50 protesters reported killed by two human rights groups. The BBC and most other international news organisations are barred from reporting inside Iran, and the country has been under a near-total internet blackout since Thursday evening, making obtaining and verifying information difficult. A doctor from Iran, who contacted the BBC via Starlink satellite internet on Friday night, said Farabi Hospital, Tehran's main eye specialist centre, had gone into crisis mode, with emergency services overwhelmed. Non-urgent admissions and surgeries were said to have been suspended, and staff called in to deal with emergency cases. The BBC also obtained a video and audio message from a medic in a hospital in the south-west city of Shiraz on Thursday. The medic said large numbers of injured people were being brought in, and the hospital did not have enough surgeons to cope with the influx. He claimed many of the wounded had gunshot injuries to the head and eyes. Since protests began on 28 December, at least 50 protesters and 15 security personnel have been killed, according to the US-based Human Rights Activist News Agency (HRANA). More than 2,311 individuals have also been arrested, the group reported. The Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHRNGO) said at least 51 protesters, including nine children, had been killed. BBC Persian has spoken to the families of 22 of them and confirmed their identities. United Nations Secretary General spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said the UN was very disturbed by the loss of life. "People anywhere in the world have a right to demonstrate peacefully, and governments have a responsibility to protect that right and to ensure that that right is respected," he said. French President Emmanuel Macron, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz released a joint statement that said: "The Iranian authorities have the responsibility to protect their own population and must allow for the freedom of expression and peaceful assembly without fear of reprisal." Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei remained defiant in a televised address on Friday, saying: "The Islamic Republic came to power through the blood of several hundred thousand honourable people and it will not back down in the face of those who deny this." Later, in remarks made to a gathering of supporters and broadcast on state television, Khamenei reiterated the message, saying Iran "will not shirk from dealing with destructive elements". Iran's UN ambassador accused the US of "interfering in Iran's internal affairs through threats, incitement, and the deliberate encouragement of instability and violence," in a letter to the UN Security Council. At the White House on Friday, Trump said his administration was watching the situation in Iran carefully. "It looks to me that the people are taking over certain cities that nobody thought were really possible just a few weeks ago," he said. He echoed earlier warnings to Iran's leadership, saying: "We will be hitting them very hard where it hurts." He added that any US involvement did not mean "boots on the ground". On Thursday, Trump said he would "hit them very hard" if they "start killing people". Later on Friday, the US said Iran's foreign minister was "delusional" after he accused Israel and Washington of fuelling the protests. "This statement reflects a delusional attempt to deflect from the massive challenges the Iranian regime faces at home," a US State Department spokesperson said in response to the comments by Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi during a visit to Lebanon. Early on Saturday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio posted on X: "The United States supports the brave people of Iran." Meanwhile, the Iranian security and judicial authorities issued a series of coordinated warnings to protestors on Friday, hardening their rhetoric and echoing an earlier message of "no leniency" by Iran's top security body, the Supreme National Security Council (SNSC). Iran's National Security Council said "decisive and necessary legal action will be taken" against protesters, which it described as "armed vandals" and "disruptors of peace and security". The intelligence arm of Iran's Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) said it would not tolerate what it described as "terrorist acts", asserting that it would continue its operations "until the complete defeat of the enemy's plan".

### 2. [Greenlanders unnerved as they find themselves in geopolitical storm](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgrd2e7p9reo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

Greenlanders unnerved as they find themselves in geopolitical storm US Secretary of State Marco Rubio will meet Danish officials next week to discuss the fate of Greenland - a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark that President Donald Trump says he needs for national security. The vast island finds itself in the eye of a geopolitical storm with Trump's name on it and people here are clearly unnerved. Yet when you fly in, it looks so peaceful. Ice and snow-capped mountains stretch as far as the eye can see, interrupted here and there by glittering fjords - all between the Arctic and the Atlantic Oceans. It is said to sit on top of the world; much of it above the Arctic Circle. Greenland is nine times the size of the UK but it only has 57,000 inhabitants, most of them indigenous Inuit. You find the biggest cluster of Greenlanders on the south-western coast in the capital, Nuuk. We arrived there as a frozen twilight was creeping across snow-covered pedestrian streets. Parents dragged their children home from school on sledges, and students mooched their way in and out of brightly-lit malls. Few wanted to talk to us about the Trump-related angst here. Those who did sounded very gloomy. One pensioner banged his walking stick on the ground in emphasis as he told me the US must never plant its flag in Greenland's capital. A lady who said she was mistrustful of everyone these days, and didn't give her name, admitted she was "scared to death" about the prospect of Trump taking the island by force after she watched his military intervention in Venezuela. Meanwhile, 20-something pottery-maker Pilu Chemnitz said: "I think we are all very tired of the US president. We have always lived a quiet and peaceful life here. "Of course, the colonisation by Denmark caused a lot of trauma for many people but we just want to be left alone." Never mind opposing a takeover by the US, which 85% of Greenlanders say they do, most also say they favour independence from Denmark - although many tell me they also appreciate the subsidies coming from there that help prop up their welfare state. While rich in untapped natural resources, poverty is a real issue here in Inuit communities. Overall, Greenlanders want a bigger, louder say, not only in their domestic policies, but in foreign affairs too. I went to the island's modest-looking parliament, the body of it built in a Scandinavian style with wooden slats and painted the same burnished red as the Greenlandic flags fluttering by the entrance. No security checks. All pretty relaxed. Except for the roaring polar bear emblem - a symbol of Greenland, etched onto every sliding glass doors we pass. I was there to meet Pipaluk Lynge-Rasmussen, co-chair of the foreign affairs committee in parliament. She is an MP with the pro-independence Inuit Ataqatigiit party that is part of the coalition government here. "I think it's very important for us to speak out about what we want as a people," she told me. "We have always worked towards independence when we got home rule in 1979 and more independence in 2009." I asked Lynge-Rasmussen if she felt that big global powers - the US, Denmark, Nato, and the EU - were talking a lot about Greenland right now, rather than to the islanders about their fate. She nodded vigorously. Surprisingly, perhaps, she blames Denmark more than she blames Trump for overlooking Greenlanders' wants and needs. Even though Greenland and the Faroe Islands are part of the Kingdom of Denmark, she says, she feels they have always been treated like second-class citizens. But Lynge-Rasmussen insisted that Greenlanders should not see themselves as victims in the current situation. Instead, she suggests they use the international spotlight now on them to show off their importance and push for their priorities. What of the meeting next week with Rubio, I asked? "I hope the meeting will end with understanding and compromise," she answered. "Maybe doing business with [the US] from here… maybe co-operating on trade, or mining, having more American [military] bases on Greenland, perhaps?" Under a bilateral agreement with Denmark dating back to 1951 the US may bring as many US troops as it wants to Greenland. This has left European allies wondering out loud why Trump feels the need to "take" the island unilaterally: whether buying it - seemingly Washington's preferred option, or encouraging Greenlanders to vote in a plebiscite to become part of the US, or taking Greenland by force, something the Trump administration has refused to rule out. It wouldn't take much flexing of military muscles. Greenland has few trained soldiers and no military bases of its own. Trump and US Vice-President JD Vance justify their need to "take" Greenland because they say Denmark doesn't do enough to secure the island. Copenhagen disputes this. It's also worth noting that the US already has a military base on Greenland - and it chose to radically reduce its presence there from about 10,000 personnel during peak Cold War times to some 200 now. The US has long taken its eye off Arctic security, until recently. Trump's keen interest in the island is likely a mix of: perceived national security concerns - a hunger for the rich natural resources Greenland boasts, including rare earths and minerals - and his loudly-trumpeted desire to dominate the Americas. - Geographically Greenland is part of North America. It's closer to New York City by about 1,000 miles (1,609 km) than to Copenhagen. This should give Greenlanders pause for thought, opposition MP Pele Broberg of the Naleraq Party told me. He said people were scared of what Trump would do to Greenland because they were misinformed, largely because of media hysteria. "It's true, we are not for sale - but we are open for business. Or we should be. "Right now we are a colony. We are made to import our goods from Denmark: 4,000km away, rather than from the US which is much closer." Broberg described his organisation as the island's true independence party, pushing he says for freedom, so Greenlanders can trade, on their terms, with any party or country they choose: the US, Denmark or others. But right now, the US is making demands, rather than business deals between equals. So what exactly are the national security priorities Trump sees in Greenland? Briefly put: the shortest route for a Russian ballistic missile to reach continental US is Greenland and the North Pole. Washington DC already has an early warning air base on the island - but Greenland could serve as a base for missile interceptors as part of the Trump administration's proposed "Golden Dome" system: a plan to shield the US from all missile attacks. The US has also reportedly discussed placing radars in waters connecting Greenland, Iceland and the UK - the so-called GIUK Gap. That's a gateway for Chinese and Russian vessels that Washington wants to track. There is no evidence to the naked eye when you are in Greenland to back Trump's recent assertions that there are lots of Chinese and Russian ships currently around the island. And last week Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian criticised Washington for "using the so-called 'China threat' as a pretext for itself to seek selfish gains" in the Arctic. But Russia and China have been expanding their military capabilities, and have beefed up their co-operation elsewhere in the region - with joint naval patrols and co-developing new shipping routes. Under pressure from western sanctions over Ukraine, Moscow is keen to ship more to Asia. Beijing is looking for shorter, more lucrative maritime routes to Europe. The northern sea route is becoming easier to navigate due to melting ice, and Greenland opened its representation office in Beijing in 2023 in pursuit of deeper ties with China. When it comes to Arctic security, Nato allies hope to persuade Washington that they are serious. UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer reportedly spoke more than once to the US president last week, telling him that Europe will step up its presence even further in the region. He's also been urging European leaders to increase their cooperation with the US there. Greenland, Denmark and their Nato allies believe there is room for negotiation with Rubio next week and that, at the very least, Trump swooping in to Greenland militarily is unlikely - though not impossible. The Arctic powers geographically are Denmark, the US, Canada, Russia, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. An Arctic Council, representing them all, has long tried to maintain the mantra: high north, low tension. But military chest-beating and unilateralism from Washington over Greenland, plus a wider scramble for advantage between global superpowers, adds to a real sense of jeopardy in the region. The decades-long delicate balance in the Arctic, in place since the end of the Cold War, and evenly managed since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, could be dangerously upset.

Swiss search souls and question government after ski resort fire In the wake of the devastating fire at a bar in Crans-Montana, many Swiss citizens are asking themselves if their political system is fit for purpose. Switzerland, often praised for its efficiency, has a very devolved system of government, in which villages and towns are run by local officials elected from and by the community. It is a system the Swiss cherish, because they believe it ensures accountability. But there are inherent weaknesses: hypothetically, the official approving a bar license or passing a fire-safety check is the friend, neighbour, or maybe even cousin of the bar owner. When the news of the fire emerged on New Year's Eve, first there was shock. Such devastating fires are not, people thought, supposed to happen in Switzerland. Then there was grief - 40 young people lost their lives, 116 were injured, many of them very seriously. Questions followed - what caused such a catastrophe? And finally, this week - fury when Crans-Montana's Mayor, Nicolas Feraud, revealed that Le Constellation bar had not been inspected since 2019. Crans-Montana is in the Swiss canton of Valais, where fire-safety inspections are the responsibility of Mayor Feraud and his colleagues, and they are supposed to happen every 12 months. Not only had the checks not taken place, the mayor said, he had only become aware of this after the fire. And, he revealed, of 128 bars and restaurants in Crans-Montana, only 40 had been inspected in 2025. Asked why, Feraud had no answer, though he did suggest Crans-Montana had too few inspectors for the number of properties that needed checking. This was echoed by Romy Biner, the mayor of neighbouring upmarket resort Zermatt, who told local media that many communities in the canton of Valais did not have the required resources to inspect so many premises. This is not a line that plays well with many Swiss, who know that Crans-Montana and Zermatt are two of the richest winter resorts in the country. So when Feraud faced the press, there were pointed questions from Swiss journalists: How well did the mayor know the bar's owners? Had he ever been to the bar? And, was there any possibility of corruption? "Absolutely not," was his indignant answer to the last question. The mother of two brothers who survived the fire also had questions. "We urgently need complete, transparent answers," she wrote on social media. When they escaped the burning bar, each of her sons had thought at first that the other was dead. "They escaped, but they are deeply traumatised. They will carry the emotional scars forever." Those questions, from journalists and families, reveal the problems of Switzerland's devolved political system. 'A failure right across the board' Elected officials in towns like Crans-Montana have many responsibilities as well as fire safety - running schools and social services, even collecting taxes. Most of these officials work part-time and, once elected, continue with their day jobs. Nowadays some communes may be over-challenged trying to supply and oversee all the services a 21st-Century population expects, but Swiss voters expect better than what they heard from Mayor Feraud. The headlines after his press conference were savage. Many demanded Mayor Feraud and his colleagues resign. Feraud ruled this out, saying, "we were elected by the people. You don't abandon ship in the middle of a storm". "A failure right across the board", wrote the broadsheet Tagesanzeiger. "Now Switzerland's reputation is on the line." "An utter disaster", wrote the tabloid Blick, "a total failure of fire safety checks." Reputational damage is something the Swiss both hate and fear. Switzerland is a rich country, in part because of its reputation for safety, stability, reliability, and, among its own citizens, accountability. If those in charge damage that reputation, and put the country's success at risk, the Swiss are unforgiving. Heads rolled two decades ago when Swissair, the much-loved national airline, went bankrupt. Once nicknamed affectionately "the flying bank", Swissair's management had made a series of risky financial investments that left the airline dangerously over-extended. In 2008, banking giant UBS, in which many Swiss, especially pensioners, had shares, had to be bailed out by Swiss taxpayers to prevent not just its own downfall, but disastrous consequences for the global economy. When the bank's reckless over-exposure to subprime mortgages was revealed, there was outrage. At the bank's annual general meeting that year, normally sedate elderly shareholders hissed and booed. One even jumped on to the stage, demanding the management give up their generous bonuses, ironically waving a string of Swiss bratwursts under their noses "in case you go hungry". Crans-Montana, too, has aroused that same angry feeling of trust betrayed. But this is much worse than Swissair or UBS. Forty people, many of them teenagers, are dead. Dozens more have suffered life-changing injuries. The Swiss authorities know there must be answers, quickly. At Friday's memorial service, the president of Valais, Matthias Reynard, was close to tears as he promised a "strict and independent" investigation, warning that "relevant political authorities" would be held accountable. Switzerland's president Guy Parmelin said he expected justice "without delay and without leniency". The owner of the bar is now in custody, subject to a criminal investigation, but the role of the local government is sure to be examined, too. There are already calls for fire-safety inspection in Valais canton to be taken away from local town councils and given to the cantonal authorities. Romain Jourdan, a lawyer acting for some of the families, has announced plans to file a case against Crans-Montana's town council. The families, he said, "are demanding that all local officials be questioned, so that such a tragedy never happens again". There is a deeper, nationwide soul-searching going on as well. The Swiss want to know why their beloved devolved system, which many, perhaps complacently, believed to be near perfect, went so catastrophically wrong. In the first hours after the fire, many people, along with their shock and grief, felt a certain quiet pride that their emergency services had responded so quickly. Firefighters, ambulances crews, and even helicopters were at the scene within minutes. The emergency services were present at the memorial service. Many openly wept. The shock and grief still sits deep, but the pride has evaporated. What good are top-of-the-range, highly professional emergency services, the Swiss are asking themselves, if basic fire safety checks are neglected? Switzerland's government says finding answers is a moral responsibility - to the families above all, but also to its own voters.

**Excerpt**

Musk says X outcry is 'excuse for censorship' Elon Musk has said that critics of his social media site X are looking for "any excuse for censorship", amid reports that X's artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot Grok was creating non-consensual sexualised images of people, including children. Ofcom says it is conducting an urgent assessment of X in response, which has been backed by Technology Secretary Liz Kendall. She described the sexual manipulation of images of women and children as "despicable and abhorrent", adding that she would expect to see an update from Ofcom in "days". X has now limited the use of AI image function to those who pay a monthly fee, a change dubbed by Downing Street as "insulting" to victims of sexual violence. The BBC has seen several examples of the free AI tool undressing women and putting them in sexual situations without their consent. Ashley St Clair, the mother of one of Elon Musk's children, told BBC Newshour that Grok had generated sexualised photos of her as a child. The conservative influencer said her image had been "stripped" to appear "basically nude, bent over", despite her telling Grok that she did not consent to the sexualised images. St Clair, who filed a lawsuit against Musk last year seeking sole custody of their child, accused the social media site of "not taking enough action" to tackle illegal content, including child sexual abuse imagery. "This could be stopped with a singular message to an engineer," she said. As of Friday morning, Grok was telling users asking it to alter images uploaded to X that "image generation and editing are currently limited to paying subscribers", adding users "can subscribe to unlock these features". An Ofcom spokesperson said: "We urgently made contact [with X] on Monday and set a firm deadline of today [Friday] to explain themselves, to which we have received a response." "We're now undertaking an expedited assessment as a matter of urgency and will provide further updates shortly." Ofcom's powers under the Online Safety Act include being able to seek a court order to prevent third parties from helping X raise money or be accessed in the UK - should the firm refuse to comply. Kendall has said that Ofcom will have the government's full support if it makes the decision to block X in the UK. The use of Grok to generate non-consensual sexualised images has been condemned by politicians on all sides: Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer calling it "disgraceful" and "disgusting" - Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said it was "horrible in every way" and that X "needs to go further" than the changes it had made to Grok on Friday, but he added that banning the platform would be an attack on free speech - The Liberal Democrats called for access to X to be temporarily restricted in the UK while the social media site was investigated. -

**Excerpt**

Night of Swiss ski bar fire 'apocalyptic', woman tells Crans-Montana memorial Tragedy brought people together in Crans-Montana and brought the country to a standstill. On Friday, just down the road from the bar where 40 young people were killed by fire on New Year's Eve, church bells rang in their memory. They tolled right across Switzerland, to mark a national day of mourning. Then, moments after the last notes of a special memorial service had faded, came the news that one of the bar's owners had been detained. Swiss prosecutors said Jacques Moretti, a French national, was a potential flight risk. He and his wife Jessica, who is also French, are suspected of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence. Many of the victims' families had demanded action like this from the start: more than a week after the fire, the anger in this community has been increasing. At the main ceremony in Martigny, down in the valley, relatives of the dead were joined by survivors. Some had come from hospital for the memorial. People held white roses in their laps and gripped each other's hands for support. "The images we faced were unbearable. A scene worse than a nightmare. Screams ringing out in the icy cold, the smell of burning. It was apocalyptic," a young woman called Marie told the audience. She had been in a bar opposite Le Constellation when the fire broke out and suddenly found herself helping the injured as they ran from the flames. She said she would never forget what she'd seen. Listening in the front row were the presidents of France and Italy, whose citizens were among those killed and injured in the fire. Both countries have opened their own investigations. Back in Rome, Italy's prime minister vowed to make sure all those responsible were identified. "This was no accident. It was the result of too many people who did not do their jobs," Giorgia Meloni said. She wants to know why the music wasn't cut as soon as the fire started. "Why did no-one tell the young people to get out? Why did the council not make the proper checks? There are too many whys." In Crans-Montana people have the same questions and many more. For now, the only two formal suspects are the co-owners of Le Constellation, Jacques and Jessica Moretti. Early on Friday, the pair were called in by prosecutors. They are being investigated for causing death and injury through negligence but have not been charged. Now Jacques Moretti has been remanded in custody. In a statement, the public ministry said the move followed a "new assessment of the flight risk." "I constantly think of the victims and of the people who are struggling," his wife told a crush of TV cameras after several hours of questioning at the ministry. It was her first public comment since the fire. "It is an unimaginable tragedy. It happened in our establishment, and I would like to apologise." Nine days on, Le Constellation is still obscured from view behind white plastic sheets. A lone policeman stands guard, his face covered against the relentless snow. What unfolded inside the building's basement has gradually become clearer – and it's the story of a disaster that should never have happened. Mobile phone footage shows a sparkler tied to a champagne bottle apparently starting the fire as it brushes the ceiling. Covered with soundproofing foam that was never safety tested, it ignites quickly. When the crowd eventually rush for the exit in panic, there is a crush on the stairs. It seems the emergency doors were blocked. But another video, from six years ago, suggests the risk was well known. On the footage, a waiter can be heard warning that the material on the ceiling is flammable. "Be careful with the foam," the voice shouts, as people wave the same sparklers. But the questions here are not just for the owners. This week the local authorities in Crans made the shocking admission that they hadn't carried out mandatory safety checks of the bar for five years. They offered no explanation. "It was a hell inside that bar. More than 1,000 degrees of temperature. There was no way to escape," Italy's ambassador to Switzerland, Gian Lorenzo Cornado, told the BBC, citing a long list of safety violations. Six Italians were killed as a result. "Italy wants justice, the Italian government wants justice and the Italian people want justice, for sure. The families want justice," the ambassador stressed. That includes for those with life-changing injuries. The regional hospital in Sion took the first major influx of patients. The stress was compounded by the fact that many doctors' own children were partying in Crans for the New Year. "They were all scared the next stretcher to arrive would be carrying their own child," hospital director Eric Bonvin remembers. But he's proud of how his team coped. Some casualties were unconscious and so badly burned, it took time to identify them. The most serious cases were moved to specialist burns centres elsewhere in Switzerland and in Europe where some are still in a critical condition. All face a long, tough path to recovery which the doctor likens to a "rebirth" because many of his young patients have severe burns to the face. "First the body needs to be protected, like the foetus in a mother's womb. That's what's happening for many now. Then they will have to re-enter the world and find their identity," Professor Bonvin says. "It will take a lot of work and resilience." Add to that the anguish of surviving. "They came round and at first they felt lucky to be alive. But some now feel this guilt, wondering why they are here, but not their friend or brother," Bonvin explains. "It is a delicate moment." In central Crans, the heap of tributes for the dead is still growing, protected from the elements by a canvas. After leaving their own fresh flowers on Friday, many people then stood in front of the ruins of the bar itself for a moment. Remembering, in silence.

**Excerpt**

Russia hits Ukraine with rarely used Oreshnik missile in fresh strikes Russia has used the Oreshnik ballistic missile as part of a massive overnight strike on Ukraine. Four people were killed and 25 others injured in Kyiv on Thursday night, where loud booms could be heard for several hours, setting the sky alight with explosions. It is only the second time that Moscow has used the Oreshnik, which was first deployed to hit the central city of Dnipro in November 2024. Russia's defence ministry said the strike was a response to a Ukrainian drone attack targeting Vladimir Putin's residence in late December, which Kyiv denies carrying out. While the ministry did not specify what had been the Oreshnik's target, shortly before midnight (22:00 GMT) videos began circulating on social media showing numerous explosions on the outskirts of the western city of Lviv. President Volodymyr Zelensky and Ukrainian authorities confirmed that a ballistic missile had struck infrastructure in Lviv, about 60km (40 miles) from the Polish border. The Oreshnik is an intermediate-range, hypersonic ballistic missile, meaning it can potentially reach up to 5,500km (3,417 miles). It is thought to have a warhead that deliberately fragments during its final descent into several, independently targeted inert projectiles, causing distinctive repeated explosions moments apart. "Such a strike close to EU and Nato border is a grave threat to the security on the European continent and a test for the transatlantic community," Ukrainian foreign minister Andrii Sybiha said. The strike was launched "in response to [Putin's] own hallucinations," he added, referring to the alleged drone attack on the president's residence in December. The EU had immediately cast serious doubt on whether the drone strike ever happened, and last week Donald Trump said he did not think any such attack had taken place. On Friday EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said Russia's Oreshnik strike was meant as a warning to Europe and the US. "Putin doesn't want peace, Russia's reply to diplomacy is more missiles and destruction. This deadly pattern of recurring major Russian strikes will repeat itself until we help Ukraine break it," she wrote on X. Zelensky said in addition to the Oreshnik, 13 ballistic missiles targeted energy facilities and civilian infrastructure overnight, along with 22 cruise missiles and 242 drones. One damaged a building at the Qatari embassy, he added. He accused the attacks of aiming "against the normal life of ordinary people" during a cold spell and added everything possible was being done to restore heating and electricity. As Lviv and other western regions were targeted on Thursday night, more than a dozen missiles and hundreds of drones were deployed during the attack on Kyiv. A paramedic was among those killed while arriving at a damaged apartment in Kyiv. The capital's mayor, Vitali Klitschko, and Zelensky said it had been a "double-tap" hit - in which the first strike is followed by a second, killing rescuers who have arrived to help the injured. Two apartment buildings along the east bank of the Dnipro River and a high-rise building in the city's central district were also targeted. The morning after, as the clean-up got underway, the businesses that hadn't been damaged were open. A coffee shop just a few floors down from a destroyed apartment was serving customers. Wreckage from a Russian drone, including its wings and engine, were still scattered over the pavement outside. At another site, the round, charred entry hole of a missile was visible on the 11th floor of an apartment block in a quiet residential area. The power supply was disrupted in several of the city's neighbourhoods in the middle of a particularly harsh winter and as Kyiv braces for -15C (5F) temperatures this weekend. On Friday Klitschko urged Kyiv residents to leave temporarily if they were able to, and find warmth. "Half of Kyiv's apartment buildings - nearly 6,000 - are currently without heat due to damage to the capital's critical infrastructure caused by a massive enemy attack," he wrote on social media. Kyiv's streets now relentless hum with the buzz of the diesel generators that businesses rely on for power, but many residential buildings are reliant on central heating and restoring it can be a longer task. The targeting of power plants has become a constant feature of this war, with Ukraine increasingly responding in kind to Russia's sustained attacks on energy infrastructure that regularly leave millions without access to electricity or heating. On Thursday night, as Moscow's attack on Ukraine was ongoing, half a million people in the Russian region of Belgorod were left without power following Ukrainian shelling of infrastructure, the local governor said. Authorities also said that a Ukrainian strike on a Russian power plant in the city of Oryol, further north, affected the water and heating systems.
