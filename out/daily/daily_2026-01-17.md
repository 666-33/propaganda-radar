Trump tariff threat over Greenland 'unacceptable', European leaders say A threat by President Donald Trump to impose fresh tariffs on eight allies opposed to his proposed takeover of Greenland has drawn condemnation from European leaders. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the move was "completely wrong", while French President Emmanuel Macron called it "unacceptable". The comments came after Trump announced a 10% tariff on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the UK, the Netherlands and Finland would come into force on 1 February but could later rise to 25% - and would last until a deal was reached. Mr Trump insists the autonomous Danish territory is critical for US security and has not ruled out taking it by force. Meanwhile, thousands of people took to the streets in Greenland and Denmark on Saturday in protest at the proposed US takeover. Greenland is sparsely populated but resource-rich and its location between North America and the Arctic makes it well placed for early warning systems in the event of missile attacks and for monitoring vessels in the region. Trump has previously said Washington would get the territory "the easy way" or "the hard way". European countries have rallied to Denmark's support. They have argued that the security of the Arctic region should be a joint Nato responsibility. France, Germany, Sweden, Norway, Finland, the Netherlands and the UK have dispatched a small number of troops to Greenland in a so-called reconnaissance mission. Announcing the new tariffs in a post on his Truth Social platform on Saturday, Trump said those countries were playing "a very dangerous game". At stake, he said, was the "Safety, Security, and Survival of our Planet". He said the proposed 10% levy to be introduced next month on goods exported to the US would rise to 25% in June and remain "payable until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland". In his response, Starmer said: "Applying tariffs on allies for pursuing the collective security of Nato allies is completely wrong. We will of course be pursuing this directly with the US administration." France's Emmanuel Macron said: "Tariff threats are unacceptable in this context... We will not be swayed by any intimidation." Swedish PM Ulf Kristersson said: We won't let ourselves be blackmailed." "Sweden is currently having intensive discussions with other EU countries, Norway and the United Kingdom to find a joint response," he added. European Council President Antonio Costa stated: "The European Union will always be very firm in defending international law... which of course begins within the territory of the member states of the European Union." Denmark's foreign minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said the threat had "come as a surprise". Meanwhile, German MEP Manfred Weber, head of the conservative EPP group in the European Parliament, said Trump's move raised questions about the still-to-be-ratified EU-US trade deal negotiated last year. Brussels and Washington clinched a deal that agreed a US tariff on all EU goods of 15% and that the 27-member bloc would open its markets to US exporters with 0% tariffs on certain products. "The EPP is in favour of the EU-US trade deal, but given Donald Trump's threats regarding Greenland, approval is not possible at this stage," Weber posted on X. "The 0% tariffs on US products must be put on hold," he added. The US ambassador to the UN, Mike Waltz, however, said Denmark "just doesn't have the resources or the capacity to do what needs to be done in the northern region". He told Fox News the life of Greenlanders would be "safer, stronger and more prosperous under the umbrella of the United States". Trump has often mused that "tariff" is his favourite word, and he has made clear that he views it as something of a blunt instrument with which to convince – or coerce – countries around the world to align their policies with the desired outcomes of the White House. But his announcement represents a significant escalation in his recently rekindled drive to acquire Greenland, despite their opposition. It is unclear what immediately prompted the tariffs announcement, which Trump first hinted at while speaking to reporters at the White House on Friday. While in recent weeks he has repeatedly said that a variety of options – including the potential use of military force – remained on the table, the announcement comes just days after US and Danish officials agreed to set up a high-level working group to discuss the future of the island. In Washington's diplomatic and political circles, that announcement was seen by many as a "best-case" scenario for Denmark and its European allies – one that would, at the very least, delay any decision or further escalation from the White House. Instead, the latest tariffs have injected a newfound sense of urgency into the issue and strained relations with important Nato allies and trading partners. Opinion polls suggest 85% of Greenlanders oppose the territory joining the US. Demonstrations against Trump's takeover plans were held in Danish cities as well as in Greenland's capital, Nuuk, on Saturday - before the tariff announcement. In the Danish capital, Copenhagen, placards were held up reading: "Hands Off Greenland" and "Greenland for Greenlanders". "We demand respect for the Danish Realm and for Greenland's right to self-determination," said Camilla Siezing, heads of Inuit, an umbrella group of Greenlandic associations. In Nuuk, Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen joined protesters holding signs reading "Greenland is not for sale" and "we shape our future" as they headed for the US consulate. The rallies coincide with a visit to Copenhagen by a delegation from the US Congress. Its leader, Democratic Senator Chris Coons, described Mr Trump's rhetoric as "not constructive".

**Excerpt**

Big names on Trump's peace panel face huge challenges in Gaza The White House has announced the first members of its Gaza "Board of Peace", and the list of names will do little to dispel the criticism from some quarters that the US president's plan resembles, at its heart, a colonial solution imposed over the heads of the Palestinians. There are still several unknowns - namely who else might be added, and the exact structure of what is currently a rather complicated layout. So far, no Palestinian names are included on the two separate senior boards that have been officially unveiled. One is a "founding Executive Board", with a high-level focus on investment and diplomacy. The other, called the "Gaza Executive Board", is responsible for overseeing all on-the-ground work of yet another administrative group, the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG). That committee is made up of supposedly technocratic, apolitical Palestinians, led by Dr Ali Shaath, a civil engineer by training who's held ministerial positions in the Palestinian Authority. But of the seven members of the founding Executive Board, six are Americans - including US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other members of Trump's inner circle like his son-in-law Jared Kushner, and Steve Witkoff, who is US Special Envoy to the Middle East, but also a friend of the president and a fellow real estate developer. Ajay Banga, president of the World Bank, is something of an exception as an Indian-born US citizen. Sir Tony Blair, meanwhile, is a former UK Prime Minister, and his inclusion is likely to further fuel concerns about how the Board of Peace will operate. Over the past few weeks, criticism of Sir Tony's possible inclusion has come from figures like prominent politician Mustafa Barghouti, general secretary of the Palestinian National Initiative, and newspaper reports quoting unnamed officials from Arab states in the region. Sir Tony's central role in the Iraq war, coupled with Britain's own colonial history in the Middle East, is deemed by his opponents to make him entirely unsuitable. Francesca Albanese, the United Nations' special rapporteur on human rights in the occupied Palestinian territories, wrote on social media last year: "Tony Blair? Hell no. Hands off Palestine." Even Trump seemed to acknowledge the issue. "I've always liked Tony, but I want to find out that he's an acceptable choice to everybody," the president said last October. There is significant overlap between the two senior boards, with Kushner, Witkoff and Sir Tony appearing on both. But the Gaza Executive Board does include the names of some senior political figures and diplomats from Turkey, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. It will be headed by the former Bulgarian politician, Nickolay Mladenov, who's been given the title of High Representative for Gaza. Yakir Gabay, a businessman born in Israel and now based in Cyprus is the only Israeli member. In its statement announcing the names, the White House said those chosen will work to ensure "effective governance and the delivery of best-in-class services that advance peace, stability, and prosperity for the people of Gaza". And whatever the concerns and complexities, the plan remains the only game in town, with many world leaders pledging their support and commitment to helping make it a success. Its architecture is further complicated by the fact that, sitting above all the structures announced so far, will be the Board of Peace itself, with President Trump as the chairman. Names of that supreme body have not yet been announced, but the current UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Egypt's Abdel Fattah El-Sisi and Canadian leader Mark Carney have reportedly been invited to join. In the end, whether the most vocal critics can be assuaged will depend on how quickly the new members of the senior teams can begin to drive change that makes a real difference in both daily life for Palestinians and, crucially, further concrete steps towards a lasting peace. Major challenges remain to both of those goals. The UN estimates around 80% of buildings in Gaza have been destroyed or damaged and families who have survived the war are now struggling with the winter weather, and a lack of food and shelter. While aid groups say there has been some improvements, they accuse Israel of imposing continuing restrictions upon their work. Israel says that it is facilitating humanitarian assistance, and has blamed the UN for failing to distribute supplies already in Gaza. It argues any restrictions are designed to stop Hamas infiltrating and exploiting relief efforts. Showing meaningful progress towards rebuilding will also be a Herculean task, involving not only the removal of an estimated 60 million tonnes of rubble, but first finding and disposing of the dead bodies and unexploded bombs contained within it. Perhaps the biggest challenge though is maintaining the fraying ceasefire itself. Another name has been released by the White House, that of Major General Jasper Jeffers as the Commander of the International Stabilization Force (ISF). Backed by a UN mandate, it will have the tough job of ensuring the demilitarisation of Gaza. As yet, there's no clear road map for how Hamas will be persuaded to give up its weapons, nor any clear idea of which country will provide troops for that force or what its remit and rules of engagement will be. Hamas has said it will only disarm as part of a wider deal establishing a Palestinian state. Israel, whose ground troops still control more than half of the Gaza Strip, has said it will only withdraw if Hamas disarms. How that catch-22 can be resolved is perhaps the biggest test of all.

US judge restricts ICE response to Minneapolis protesters A US federal judge has issued an order limiting the crowd control tactics that can be used by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents (ICE) towards "peaceful and unobstructive" protesters in Minneapolis. Judge Katherine Menendez ruled on Friday night that federal agents can't arrest or pepper spray peaceful demonstrators, including those monitoring and observing ICE agents. The ruling comes ahead of planned weekend protests against the widespread immigration action in the city and follows the fatal shooting of Renee Good by an ICE agent earlier this month. The US Department of Homeland Security said it is taking measures to protect officers from rioters. On Friday, Minnesota officials urged protesters expected to take to the streets this weekend to stay orderly and peaceful. The state's National Guard has been placed on alert and other law enforcement officers have been deployed ahead of both expected anti-ICE demonstrations and a counter march being planned by a conservative influencer. Judge Menendez's 83-page order bars federal agents from arresting and "using pepper-spray or similar nonlethal munitions and crowd dispersal tools against persons who are engaging in peaceful and unobstructive protest activity". The ruling, which stems from a lawsuit filed by a group of protesters in December, also limits agents from "stopping or detaining drivers and passengers in vehicles where there is no reasonable articulable suspicion that they are forcibly obstructing or interfering" with their work. "The act of safely following [immigration agents] at an appropriate distance does not, by itself, create reasonable suspicion to justify a vehicle stop," it says. In a statement to CBS, the BBC's US partner, in response to the order, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said the agency "is taking appropriate and constitutional measures to uphold the rule of law and protect our officers and the public from dangerous rioters". The White House also criticised the ruling. "This absurd ruling embraces a dishonest, left-wing narrative," spokesperson Abigail Jackson told Politico. "Here's the truth: federal agents have acted lawfully to protect themselves and ensure the integrity of their operations when individuals attempt to intervene." Minneapolis has been on edge since Good's 7 January shooting, with protests across the city. There have been some reported clashes between protesters and federal officers over the past week. On Saturday, the Minnesota National Guard posted on X that troops "are on standby, ready to assist local law enforcement and public safety agencies." The post added that National Guard troops will wear high-visibility yellow vests "to help distinguish them from other agencies in similar uniforms". Additionally on Friday, the justice department announced it was investigating two of the state's leading Democrats - Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey - over alleged attempts to impede federal immigration operations. Both have condemned the ICE operations in the city. "A reminder to all those in Minnesota: No one is above the law," US Attorney General Pam Bondi said in an online statement. The investigation was criticised by Walz and Frey. "Weaponizing the justice system against your opponents is an authoritarian tactic," Walz said in a statement.

Avalanches kill five off-piste skiers in Austrian Alps Five off-piste skiers have died in two avalanches in the Austria's Alps following heavy snowfall in the region. An avalanche hit a group of seven skiers in the Pongau area near Salzburg, killing four and seriously injuring one on Saturday, local mountain rescue officials said. A similar avalanche swept away a skier in the same area earlier in the day. Poor conditions have led to the recent deaths of a number of people in the Alps over the last week. In the latest incidents, the mountain rescue service said it was alerted around 14:00 local time (13:00 GMT). Four people were found dead, while another suffered serious injuries, they said. Around an hour and a half before, a female skier was buried by an avalanche in open alpine terrain near the same area. "Our deepest sympathies go out to the families. This tragedy painfully demonstrates how serious the current avalanche situation is," said Gerhard Kremser, district head of the Pongau mountain rescue service. Further avalanches were recorded in the Pongau region around midday, but no-one was injured. On Tuesday, an avalanche killed a 13-year-old Czech boy skiing in the Austrian Alpine resort of Bad Gastein. Last Sunday, 58-year-old skier died in an avalanche in the Tyrolean resort of Weerberg in western Austria. In neighbouring Switzerland, a German man was killed in an avalanche, and four other people were injured, as they were cross-country skiing on Friday. Last weekend in France, six skiers died after being caught in avalanches in various Alpine resorts.

### 5. [Paracetamol is safe in pregnancy, says study refuting Trump autism claims](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c74vdgkw1kzo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

Paracetamol is safe in pregnancy, says study refuting Trump autism claims Taking paracetamol while pregnant is safe and there's no evidence it raises the risk of autism, ADHD and developmental issues in children, say experts behind a major new review. Pregnant women "should feel reassured" by the findings, they say, which contradict controversial claims from US President Donald Trump last year that paracetamol "is no good" and pregnant women should "fight like hell" not to take it. His views were criticised at the time by medical organisations worldwide. Experts say this latest review, in a Lancet journal, is rigorous and should end the debate over its safety. But US health officials maintain that "many experts" have expressed concern over its use during pregnancy. The US President shocked many doctors worldwide when he and his administration claimed paracetamol - known as acetaminophen in the US - which is seen as the go-to painkiller for pregnant women - could be linked to autism in children, if taken during pregnancy. Those claims led to confusion among women and concern among health experts, and prompted this new research. Published in The Lancet Obstetrics, Gynaecology & Women's Health, it looked at 43 of the most robust studies into paracetamol use during pregnancy, involving hundreds of thousands of women, particularly those comparing pregnancies where the mother had taken the drug to pregnancies where she hadn't. The researchers say using these high-quality studies of siblings means they can dismiss other factors such as different genes and family environments, which makes their review "gold-standard". The research also looked at studies with a low risk of bias and those that followed children for more than five years to check for any link. "When we did this analysis, we found no links, there was no association, there's no evidence that paracetamol increases the risk of autism," lead study author and consultant obstetrician Professor Asma Khalil, told the BBC. "The message is clear – paracetamol remains a safe option during pregnancy when taken as guided," she added. This reinforces guidance from major medical organisations in the UK, US and Europe on the safety of the common painkiller. Any previously-reported links between the drug and an increased risk of autism are likely to be explained by other factors, rather than a direct effect of the paracetamol itself, the review says. "This is important as paracetamol is the first-line medication we recommend for pregnant women in pain or with a fever," said Prof Khalil, professor of maternal fetal medicine at City St George's, University of London. Health advice warns that women can run the risk of harming their baby if they don't take paracetamol to bring down a high temperature or relieve pain when pregnant. This can increase the risk of miscarriage, premature birth or developmental problems in babies. Medical experts not involved in the research have welcomed the study's findings, saying it will help reduce worry among women. Prof Grainne McAlonnan, from King's College London, said expectant mothers "do not need the stress of questioning whether medicine most commonly used for a headache could have far reaching effects on their child's health". "I hope the findings of this study bring the matter to a close," she said. Prof Ian Douglas, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the review was "well-conducted" because it excluded studies of lower quality, where no account was taken of important differences between mothers who use or don't use paracetamol during pregnancy, such as underlying illnesses. According to Prof Jan Haavik, molecular neuroscientist and clinical psychiatrist at the University of Bergen, the study provides "strong evidence" that use of paracetamol during pregnancy does not increase the risk of autism, ADHD or intellectual disability and "should effectively put this question to rest". It is widely believed by scientists working in this field that autism is the result of a complex mix of factors, including genetic and environmental ones. A spokesman from the US Department of Health and Human Services said "many experts" had expressed concern over the use of acetaminophen - the US name for paracetamol - during pregnancy. For example, a review in August 2025 led by Dr Andrew Baccarelli, dean of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, found that using acetaminophen during pregnancy may increase children's autism and ADHD risk, and urged caution over "especially heavy or prolonged use". Months earlier, Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr had pledged to find out the cause of a steep rise in reported autism cases. In a controversial speech in the Oval Office in September, the US president said doctors would be advised not to prescribe the pain reliever to pregnant women. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) then issued a letter to clinicians urging them to be cautious about the use of acetaminophen in pregnancy, while also saying it was still the only drug approved for treating fevers during pregnancy. On its website, the FDA says "a causal relationship" between the drug and neurological conditions "has not been established". Health officials in the UK have stressed that paracetamol remains the safest painkiller available to pregnant women.

Japanese mayor apologises after calling staff 'human scum' The mayor of Yokohama has apologised for insulting colleagues after an official publicly accused him of making offensive remarks. At a news conference, the Japanese city's human resource chief, Jun Kubota, alleged that Mayor Takeharu Yamanaka had used terms such as "idiot" and "human scum" to disparage staff. It is highly unusual in Japan for a serving city official to openly accuse a sitting mayor and demand an apology. Yamanaka initially denied the allegations, but later admitted to some of them. "I want to frankly apologise for placing a psychological burden on the personnel director," he said. At a news conference on Thursday, Kubota accused Mayor Yamanaka of repeatedly making remarks towards officials - including himself - that could amount to workplace harassment. The mayor was accused of calling officials "useless", "silly" and "low-spec", as well as making comments about colleagues' appearance and likening them to animals. He is also accused of threatening Kubota, saying he would have to "commit seppuku" - a Japanese ritual suicide by disembowelment - if he failed to secure an international conference bid. Kubota demanded an apology from Yamanaka and called for an investigation. Yamanaka initially published a statement on his personal website, denying the allegations. But on Friday, he publicly acknowledged some remarks - such as using words like "idiot" and "human scum" - and apologised. "I am reflecting on this. I will be more careful with my words and behaviour," Yamanaka said. He said those comments were made during discussions over personnel evaluations. However, the mayor denied other accusations, including insulting colleagues' appearance. Yamanaka said an investigation was being considered under the supervision of the deputy mayor, adding that he would co-operate "sincerely" if an investigation takes place. In response, Kubota insisted Yamanaka had made the comments he has not admitted to, saying: "The mayor doesn't understand anything. I cannot accept that as an apology. I want him to change."

**Excerpt**

Under fire from the sea, families in Odesa try to escape Russian barrage From Mariia's 16th-floor flat, the calm waters of the Black Sea stretch out into the horizon beneath the fading twilight. "Up here you can see and hear when the drones come," she says, standing by a wall-length, floor-to-ceiling window. When they hit buildings and homes in the city of Odesa down below "we see all the fires too". Her daughter Eva, who is nine, has learned the shapes and sounds of the objects that zoom through the sky on a daily basis. She proudly shows off a list of social media channels she checks when the air raid alerts go off. "She knows whether what's coming is a risk or a threat, and that calms her down," her father Serhii says. There is scarcely a place in Ukraine that has not been targeted since Russia launched its full-scale invasion nearly four years ago. But in recent weeks Odesa – Ukraine's third largest city – has come under sustained attack. Through strikes on port and energy infrastructure, Russia is trying to cripple the region's economy and dent the population's morale. Moscow, however, does not just hit facilities. Its drones, most of them as big as a motorcycle, regularly crash into high-rise buildings like Masha's, exploding on impact and blowing glass and debris inward. The consequences are often deadly. "A few months ago Eva said she was afraid the drone would come too fast and we wouldn't have time to hide," Mariia says. "But I explained that if it came towards us, it would get louder and louder and then we'd know we have to run." Mariia, Serhii and Eva are originally from Kherson, a region 200km (125m) to the east of Odesa which is now in large part occupied by Russia. They left as soon as the invasion started in 2022 and mother and daughter briefly moved to Germany as refugees. But Serhii and Mariia could not bear the distance, so the family reunited in Ukraine and moved to Odesa. Now, as attacks on the region intensify, Serhii wonders whether the family should prepare to leave again. "War is only about economics, and Odesa for the Russians is about infrastructure, so they will do their best to conquer it," he says. Tucked in south-western Ukraine, Odesa was an economic powerhouse before the war. But now that Russia occupies the majority of Ukraine's coastline, the region has become even more vital. Its three ports are Ukraine's largest and include the country's only deep-water port. With land crossings disrupted, 90% of Ukraine exports last year were shipped by sea. But in wartime the region's importance is also its weakness. Last month, Vladimir Putin threatened to cut off Ukraine's access to the sea in retaliation for Ukrainian strikes on the "shadow fleet" tankers Russia uses to circumvent sanctions. That threat has translated into concrete impact. For two years, Russia's attempts to thwart Odesa's economy have been near-relentless - but the last few weeks have been particularly difficult. Aerial attacks on the ports have destroyed cargo and containers and damaged infrastructure; crew members on foreign merchant ships operating in the Gulf of Odesa have been injured or killed by drones; and 800 air-raid alerts in a year repeatedly halted port operations. The result last year was a 45% decrease in exports of agricultural products, vital to Odesa's economy. The day after a drone strike this week set a Panamanian-flagged ship alight and severely injured one of its crew members, regional government head Oleh Kiper said that shipowners entering Odesa ports "clearly understand that they are entering a war zone" and that the ships were insured. But if such attacks continue, in the long run foreign companies may be put off trading with the port. As the strikes surge, air sirens go off frequently, but not everyone heeds them. Standing in front of a destroyed gym the morning after an overnight drone strike that injured seven people, Maryna Averina of the State Emergency Service concedes people have become "very careless about their own safety". A recent air raid alert lasted for most of the day. "Sitting in a shelter for 16 hours is simply unrealistic," Averina says, as gym staff emerge from the destroyed building with whatever objects they have managed to salvage from the rubble and mangled metal inside. While many Ukrainians are now sadly accustomed to the drone and missile strikes, they are increasingly frayed by the relentless attacks that cut off electricity and heating in the middle of a particularly biting winter. In December, almost a million people in Odesa were left with no power. "We were among the first regions to experience what it means to go through the winter period without electricity and without heating," says Oleh Kiper. A month later, as temperatures hover around -1C, the supply remains severely disrupted. Ada, 36, is strolling on the beach, unfazed by the wail of air alert sirens mingling with the squawking of seagulls. The drone attacks have ramped up but, she says, "the shelling isn't as scary as this cold is". Nearby, a young mum named Yana agrees. Recently, she says, the situation across the board "has been really, really difficult". At one point, a drone crashed into her flat, and another one hit the block soon afterwards. Then came the power cuts. She and her family bought an expensive generator, but running it for seven hours costs around $10 - a significant expense in a country where the average monthly salary is around $500 (£375). "We've all been living like this for four years now, unfortunately. We're as helpless as flies, and everything is just being decided between the authorities," she says, while struggling to keep her shrieking toddler out of the icy water. "Maybe we're being punished for something – the whole nation, not just a few, but everyone." Further down the beach, Kostiantyn is fishing on a jetty stretching out into the sea. He says he is not worried about the Russians advancing to the city. "I don't think they'll make it here. [The Ukrainians] will break their legs first." But, he adds, things are painful, and scary. And like many Ukrainians he still seems to struggle to accept that war came to his country four years ago, waged by a neighbour he once knew so well. In his youth, Kostiantyn served in the army and swore an oath to the Soviet Union. "I never imagined that I would see something like this in my old age," he says. While Russian propagandists have long insisted that Ukraine's independence since 1991 is a historical mistake, Odesa's past role as the jewel in the crown of the Russian empire means it still holds particularly strong symbolic importance for Moscow. Vladimir Putin has repeatedly referred to Odesa as a "Russian city" and frequently invoked the notion of "liberating Novorossiya", a historical region of the Russian empire that encompassed parts of modern southern and eastern Ukraine, including Odesa. "They wanted and they still want to seize Odesa, just like many other regions, but today everything possible and impossible is being done by our military to prevent this from happening," insists the regional government leader. Oleh Kiper has made it a personal mission to sever any perceived remaining ties that Odesa has with Russia. He is a staunch supporter of a 2023 Law on Decolonisation, which directed local authorities to rid their cities of any street names, monuments or inscriptions that could be linked to Russia's imperial past. Among the statues to be removed was a monument to Russian Empress Catherine the Great, while streets named after Russian and Soviet figures were renamed. Pushkin Street became Italian Street, and Catherine Street is now European Street. Kiper also champions the usage of Ukrainian in a city where Russian is still widely spoken. Asked about the resistance he meets from Odesites who are proud of their heritage as a multicultural port to the world, he is defiant. "The enemy is doing far more than we are to ensure that a Russian-speaking city becomes Ukrainian," says Kiper. "It is forcing people to understand who the Russians are and whether we need them at all." The following day, as temperatures dropped to -6C, the city marked one month of partial blackouts, and air raid alerts were in force for four hours. The port of Chornomorsk, east of Odesa, was again hit by a ballistic missile, injuring a crew member on a civilian ship. As is the case with the rest of Ukraine, if Russia cannot have Odesa, it seems determined to continue crippling it. Additional reporting by Liubov Sholudko

**Excerpt**

What a seventh term for 81-year-old leader means for Uganda For supporters of Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni, his resounding victory in the just-concluded election is a vindication of his 40-year-long rule. He won with 72% of the vote, close to his highest-ever tally of 74% in Uganda's first direct presidential election in 1996. It reinforces the 81-year-old's claim that he still commands the support of the overwhelming majority of Ugandans, after seizing power as a rebel commander in 1986 ending the rule of the Milton Obote regime. But Museveni's main election rival - the charismatic former pop star Bobi Wine - dismissed the result as "fake" and said he had gone into hiding following a raid on his home by the security forces. Museveni campaigned largely on his track-record, arguing that he has delivered political and economic stability in an era of global uncertainty. He pledged to steer Uganda towards achieving the status of a middle-income country by 2030, a milestone his supporters have framed as a fitting legacy for a man who will finish his seventh - and possibly final - term the following year. Museveni sees Uganda's nascent oil industry as a central pillar towards achieving that goal. On the campaign trail, he repeatedly told voters that once exports commence, the economy would grow at double-digit rates. Museveni has set October as the target date for the first crude oil exports, via a 1,443 km pipeline to the Indian Ocean port of Tanga in Tanzania. Despite his age, the president has sought to project vitality and control. At one of his final campaign rallies, he told supporters that he had visited all of Uganda's more than 140 electoral constituencies. Yet in early October, his team abruptly cancelled several campaign events, citing unspecified "state duties" - an explanation many found unconvincing, fuelling speculation about the octogenarian's health. Subsequent pauses in his schedule only deepened speculation about fatigue and declining health. For Wine, the result was a massive blow. His share of the vote slumped from 35% in 2021 to 25% this time round, despite Uganda's overwhelmingly young population - a demographic long viewed as the 43-year-old's natural base. From Wine's perspective, the election was neither credible nor legitimate. He maintains that the campaign was far from free and fair, pointing to repeated disruptions of his rallies by security forces, including the use of tear gas and live ammunition to intimidate supporters, some of whom were killed. He also alleged ballot stuffing but has not provided any evidence to back his claims. The authorities have not commented on the claims. After two unsuccessful presidential bids, questions now hang over his political future. There is a growing risk that he could follow the path of many opposition figures across Africa - politicians whose popular appeal was steadily eroded by sustained repression, leaving them permanently excluded from power. During the campaign, Wine embodied the energy and impatience of Uganda's youth, while Museveni cast himself as the seasoned patriarch, the guarantor of stability. Ultimately, according to the disputed official results, voters opted for the latter. Those seeking to understand Uganda's next chapter have largely focused on the question of presidential succession - when and how Museveni will eventually exit the stage. Ugandan journalist and political analyst Allan Kasujja - a former BBC Newsday radio and podcast presenter - cautions against being fixated with the issue. "Change in Uganda, especially political change, does not, and almost certainly will not, happen suddenly," Kasujja says. "It happens gradually, and that process has been under way for some time." Viewed through that lens, the election appears less a moment of transformation than a ritual of the political calendar, one that legitimises deeper, slower shifts taking place within the ruling party, the National Resistance Movement (NRM), and the state machinery that it controls. These shifts were first noticed during a cabinet reshuffle by Museveni in March 2023, and became unmistakable in the August 2025 elections for the NRM's top decision-making body, the Central Executive Committee. Far from being a routine internal contest, the process turned into a high-stakes struggle over positioning in a post-Museveni order. Marked by factional bargaining and allegations of widespread bribery, the elections revealed a regime increasingly driven by succession politics rather than competition with an opposition that had either been dealt with by the security forces or co-opted. It provided the clearest indication yet of the growing influence within the ruling party of army chief Gen Muhoozi Kainerugaba - the son of the president and his potential successor. Veteran figures from the party's old guard were pushed aside, replaced by newer faces, many without the credentials of having fought in the war that brought Museveni to power 40 years ago, but widely seen as loyal to his son. According to sources close to the presidency, authority at State House has become increasingly decentralised, with decisions once taken directly by Museveni now channelled through a tight inner circle of relatives and long-time associates. Museveni's day-to-day schedule is said to be overseen by his eldest daughter, Natasha Karugire. Relations with foreign dignitaries and senior military figures are largely managed by his half-brother, Salim Saleh, while trade and economic policy are shaped by his son-in-law, Odrek Rwabwogo, married to Museveni's second daughter, Patience. And for the first time in the country's modern history, all security matters - both internal and external - are overseen by the chief of defence forces, the 51-year-old Gen Kainerugaba. Given the dominant role that the military has long played in Ugandan politics and the fact that Museveni himself came to power through armed struggle, this concentration of authority in his hands has profound political implications. It suggests that Uganda's future is being shaped - and increasingly controlled - by Museveni's son, even if he does not hold the title of head of state, yet.

### 9. [Canada's deal with China signals it is serious about shift from US](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm24k6kk1rko?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

Canada's deal with China signals it is serious about shift from US Prime Minister Mark Carney's new approach to Canada's foreign policy can perhaps be distilled in one line: "We take the world as it is, not as we wish it to be." That was his response when asked about the deal struck with China on Friday, despite concerns over its human rights record and nearly a year after he called China "the biggest security threat" facing Canada. The deal will see Canada ease tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles that it imposed in tandem with the US in 2024. In exchange, China will lower retaliatory tariffs on key Canadian agricultural products. Experts told the BBC the move represents a significant shift in Canada's policy on China, one that is shaped by ongoing uncertainty with the US, its largest trade partner. "The prime minister is saying, essentially, that Canada has agency too, and that it's not going to just sit and wait for the United States," said Eric Miller, a Washington DC based trade adviser and president of the Rideau Potomac Strategy Group. Carney told reporters on Friday that "the world has changed" in recent years, and the progress made with China sets Canada up "well for the new world order". Canada's relationship with China, he added, had become "more predictable" than its relationship with the US under the Trump administration. He later wrote, in a social media post, that Canada was "recalibrating" its relationship with China, "strategically, pragmatically, and decisively". In Canada, as daylight broke on Friday, reaction to the deal was swift. Some, like Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe, hailed it as "very good news". Farmers in Moe's province have been hard hit by China's retaliatory tariffs on Canadian canola oil, and the deal, he said, would bring much needed relief. But Ontario Premier Doug Ford, whose province is home to Canada's auto sector, was sharply critical of the deal. He said removing EV tariffs on China "would hurt our economy and lead to job losses". In a post on X, Ford said Carney's government was "inviting a flood of cheap made-in-China electric vehicles without any real guarantees of equal or immediate investment in Canada's economy". Some experts said the electric vehicle provisions in the trade deal would help China make inroads into the Canadian automobile market. With the lower EV tariffs, approximately 10% of Canada's electric vehicle sales are now expected to go to Chinese automakers, said Vivek Astvansh, a business professor at McGill University in Montreal. The expected increase in Chinese EV sales could put pressure on US-based EV makers like Tesla which are seeking to expand their market share in Canada, he said. "Carney has signalled to the Trump administration that it is warming up to China," Astvansh added. Reaction from the White House, meanwhile, has been mixed. In an interview with CNBC on Friday morning, US trade representative Jamieson Greer called the deal "problematic" and said Canada may come to regret it. President Donald Trump, however, hailed it as "a good thing". "If you can get a deal with China, you should do that," he told reporters outside the White House. Since taking office for a second time last year, Trump has imposed tariffs on Canadian sectors like metals and automotives, which has led to swirling economic uncertainty. He has also threatened to rip up a longstanding North American free trade agreement between Canada, the US and Mexico, calling it "irrelevant". That trade agreement, the USMCA, is now under a mandatory review. Canada and Mexico have both made clear they want it to remain in place. But the decision to carve out a major new deal with China is a recognition by Carney that the future of North American free trade remains unclear, Miller of the Rideau Potomac Strategy Group told the BBC. "There's a reasonable chance that we could end up in 2026 without a meaningful, workable trade deal with the United States," he said. "And Canada needs to be prepared." The deal with China drops Canada's levies on Chinese EVs from 100% to 6.1% for the first 49,000 vehicles imported each year. That quota could rise, Carney said, reaching 70,000 in half a decade. Canada and the US put levies on Chinese EVs in 2024, arguing that China was overproducing vehicles and undermining the ability of other countries to compete. China is the world's largest producer of EVs, accounting for 70% of global production. In exchange, China will cut tariffs on Canadian canola seed to around 15% by 1 March, down from the current rate of 84%. Carney said Beijing had also committed to removing tariffs on Canadian canola meal, lobsters, crabs and peas "until at least the end of the year". China also committed to removing visa requirements for Canadian visitors, Carney said. Beijing did not corroborate the details in a separate statement, but said "the two reached a preliminary joint agreement on addressing bilateral economic and trade issues". The introduction of Chinese EVs to Canada's market will likely mean cheaper prices for Canadian consumers, said Gal Raz, an associate professor of Operations Management and Sustainability at Western University and an expert on the EV supply chain. But Raz acknowledged that the deal Canada struck could hurt Canadian car manufacturers if it comes without further action from the Carney government to help the domestic sector. He said it was the result of an "unfortunate" deterioration of the Canada-US trade relationship, which he noted has also hurt Canada's automotive industry. "The US has really put Canada in a corner," he said. Asked why Canada is giving China access to its automotive market, Carney said that China produces "some of the most affordable and energy-efficient vehicles in the world". He said he expects the deal will spur Chinese investment into Canada's auto industry, though he did not provide further details. Trump himself has signalled openness to China building plants in the US if it means creating more jobs for Americans, despite his tough-on-China stance. "If they want to come in and build a plant and hire you and hire your friends and your neighbours, that's great, I love that," Trump said at the Detroit Economic Club on Tuesday. "Let China come in, let Japan come in." The US president is notably headed to Beijing for his own meeting with President Xi Jinping in April. He has also invited Xi for a state visit to Washington. For Carney, though, Friday's deal may just be the first step in a "recalibration" of Canada's trade relations. With additional reporting from Daniel Bush in Washington
