Blair and Rubio among names on Gaza 'Board of Peace' The Trump administration has named US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and former UK prime minister Sir Tony Blair as two of the founding members of its "Board of Peace" for Gaza. Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner will also sit on the "founding executive board", the White House said in a statement on Friday. Trump will act as chairman of the board, which forms part of his 20-point plan to end the war between Israel and Hamas. It is expected to temporarily oversee the running of Gaza and manage its reconstruction. Also on the founding executive board are Marc Rowan, the head of a private equity firm, World Bank chief Ajay Banga and a US national security adviser, Robert Gabriel. Each member would have a portfolio "critical to Gaza's stabilisation and long-term success", the White House statement said. Trump had said on Thursday that the board had been formed, calling it the "Greatest and Most Prestigious Board ever assembled at any time, any place". Further members of the board would be named in the coming weeks, the White House said. Sir Tony was UK prime minister from 1997 to 2007 and took the UK into the Iraq War in 2003. After leaving office, he served as Middle East envoy for the Quartet of international powers (the US, EU, Russia and the UN). It comes after the announcement of a separate 15-member Palestinian technocratic committee, the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG), charged with managing the day-to-day governance of post-war Gaza. Ali Shaath, a former deputy minister in the Palestinian Authority (PA) which governs parts of the occupied West Bank not under Israeli control, will head that new committee. The statement also said that Nickolay Mladenov, a Bulgarian politician and former UN Middle East envoy, would be the board's representative on the ground in Gaza working with the NCAG. Trump's plan says an International Stabilisation Force (ISF) will also be deployed to Gaza to train and support vetted Palestinian police forces and the White House statement said that US Major General Jasper Jeffers would head this force to "establish security, preserve peace, and establish a durable terror-free environment". The White House said that a separate "Gaza executive board" was being formed that would help support governance and includes some of the same names as the founding executive board as well as further appointees. The US peace plan came into force in October and has since entered its second phase, but there remains a lack of clarity about the future of Gaza and the 2.1 million Palestinians who live there. Under phase one, Hamas and Israel agreed a ceasefire in October, as well as a hostage-prisoner exchange, a partial Israeli withdrawal, and an aid surge. Earlier this week Witkoff said phase two would see the reconstruction and full demilitarisation of Gaza, including the disarmament of Hamas and other Palestinian groups. "The US expects Hamas to comply fully with its obligations," he warned, noting these include the return of the body of the last dead Israeli hostage. "Failure to do so will bring serious consequences." However the ceasefire is fragile, with both sides accusing each other of repeated violations. Almost 450 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli strikes since it came into force, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry, while the Israeli military says three of its soldiers have been killed in attacks by Palestinian groups during the same period. Humanitarian conditions in the territory remain dire, according to the UN, which has stressed the need for the unrestricted flow of critical supplies. The war in Gaza was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 71,260 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

US justice department investigating Minnesota Democrats over alleged obstruction of ICE The US justice department is investigating two prominent Minnesota liberals over alleged attempts to impede federal immigration operations, an escalation of the Trump's administration's clash with Democrats. Gov Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey are facing an inquiry over comments made about Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), according to the BBC's US partner CBS News. The investigation came as a federal judge limited what actions thousands of federal law enforcement officers could use in Minneapolis, blocking the use of pepper spray and arrests of peaceful protesters. Protests have ramped up in the city after Renee Good, 37, was shot and killed by an ICE agent last week. New details also came to light on Friday about Good's death. The Minneapolis woman was found by paramedics with at least three gunshot wounds and possibly a fourth to the head, according to official reports viewed by CBS. Governor Walz responded on Friday to news of the inquiry against him by posting on X: "Weaponizing the justice system against your opponents is an authoritarian tactic. "The only person not being investigated for the shooting of Renee Good is the federal agent who shot her." In a statement to the BBC, Mayor Frey said "I will not be intimidated". "This is an obvious attempt to intimidate me for standing up for Minneapolis, our local law enforcement, and our residents against the chaos and danger this Administration has brought to our streets," he said. The BBC has reached out to the justice department about the apparent investigation. The governor has urged Minnesotans to protest peacefully, but members of the Trump administration have accused him of inflammatory rhetoric, like describing ICE as a "modern-day Gestapo". Frey has demanded that immigration agents get out of Minneapolis. The inquiry is focused on a federal statute, 18 U.S.C. § 372, which makes it a crime for two or more people to conspire to prevent federal officers from carrying out their official duties through "force, intimidation or threats", a US official told CBS. Protests continued in Minneapolis on Friday as US District Judge Katherine Menendez blocked federal authorities from using pepper spray and other non-lethal force on those demonstrating. The 83-page order halts the thousands of federal officers currently deployed to the city as part of immigration operations from arresting peaceful protesters. It also blocks them from stopping or detaining those who are driving or passengers in vehicles "where there is no reasonable articulable suspicion that they are forcibly obstructing or interfering". The judge notes that a person following federal law enforcement in their vehicle "does not, by itself, create reasonable suspicion to justify a vehicle stop". Before she was killed, footage showed Good in her SUV, appearing to honk the vehicle to alert neighbours in the area of the presence of immigration authorities. The Trump administration has said that Good was impeding federal law enforcement and tried to run the agent over before he opened fire. Local officials say Good was a legal observer who posed no danger. Video of the incident show ICE agents approaching a car, which is blocking traffic and parked in the middle of the street. An officer instructs her to get out of the car. As Good turns her wheel apparently trying to drive away, her Honda Pilot SUV pulls forward with one of the agents standing near the front of the vehicle. He pulls his gun and fires. An incident report from the Minneapolis Fire Department, which was viewed by CBS News, said when they responded to the shooting scene last week, it appeared Good had been shot twice in the chest, once in her left forearm and a fourth wound, possibly from a gunshot, was seen "on the left side of the patient's head". Paramedics found Good unresponsive with an irregular pulse, and she was pronounced dead in the ambulance on the way to hospital, according to the report seen by CBS. Footage from the scene shows the agent walking off afterwards. But Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials have told CBS the officer suffered internal bleeding to the torso following the incident. No further details have been disclosed. The FBI is investigating the incident, although there is no federal civil rights inquiry into the agent who opened fire. Local officials and authorities say they have been shut out of the investigation. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump blasted demonstrators and local leaders on Friday. On Truth Social, he accused protesters of being "highly paid professionals", adding that Walz and Frey had "totally lost control". Later, the Republican president told reporters at the White House that he did not plan to invoke the Insurrection Act and send in troops to quell unrest in Minnesota, after earlier this week suggesting he might do so. "If I needed it, I'd use it. I don't think there's any reason right now to use it," he said. "It's very powerful," he added. Thousands of ICE officers remain deployed in the state. Democratic lawmakers travelled to the city for a hearing there and spent Friday condemning federal immigration operations in the state, accusing ICE of reckless and lawless actions. Ilhan Omar, a congresswoman from Minnesota who has long feuded with Trump, said that ICE was trying to "provoke chaos and fear". Adriano Espaillat, a congressman from New York, said ICE had become a "deadly weapon". Washington congresswoman Pramila Jayapal said ICE agents should not be allowed to wear masks, or make arrests without warrants, and should be required to have body cameras and name tags. The Democratic lawmakers also interviewed several residents who alleged they had been shackled and detained by ICE for hours until they could prove they were US citizens. The BBC has contacted the DHS and ICE for comment. DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin told CNN on Friday that if there was "reasonable suspicion" of someone who is "in the vicinity" of a person being detained by a DHS operation, they might be asked to confirm their identity. She rejected suggestions such tactics could be discriminatory, saying "racial animus has no place in DHS".

### 3. [Paracetamol is safe in pregnancy, says study refuting Trump autism claims](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c74vdgkw1kzo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)

**Excerpt**

Paracetamol is safe in pregnancy, says study refuting Trump autism claims Taking paracetamol while pregnant is safe and there's no evidence it raises the risk of autism, ADHD and developmental issues in children, say experts behind a major new review. Pregnant women "should feel reassured" by the findings, they say, which contradict controversial claims from US President Donald Trump last year that paracetamol "is no good" and pregnant women should "fight like hell" not to take it. His views were criticised at the time by medical organisations worldwide. Experts say this latest review, in a Lancet journal, is rigorous and should end the debate over its safety. But US health officials maintain that "many experts" have expressed concern over its use during pregnancy. The US President shocked many doctors worldwide when he and his administration claimed paracetamol or a branded version called Tylenol - which is seen as the go-to painkiller for pregnant women - could be linked to autism in children, if taken during pregnancy. Those claims led to confusion among women and concern among health experts, and prompted this new research. Published in The Lancet Obstetrics, Gynaecology & Women's Health, it looked at 43 of the most robust studies into paracetamol use during pregnancy, involving hundreds of thousands of women, particularly those comparing pregnancies where the mother had taken the drug to pregnancies where she hadn't. The researchers say using these high-quality studies of siblings means they can dismiss other factors such as different genes and family environments, which makes their review "gold-standard". The research also looked at studies with a low risk of bias and those that followed children for more than five years to check for any link. "When we did this analysis, we found no links, there was no association, there's no evidence that paracetamol increases the risk of autism," lead study author and consultant obstetrician Professor Asma Khalil, told the BBC. "The message is clear – paracetamol remains a safe option during pregnancy when taken as guided," she added. This reinforces guidance from major medical organisations in the UK, US and Europe on the safety of the common painkiller. Any previously-reported links between the drug and an increased risk of autism are likely to be explained by other factors, rather than a direct effect of the paracetamol itself, the review says. "This is important as paracetamol is the first-line medication we recommend for pregnant women in pain or with a fever," said Prof Khalil, professor of maternal fetal medicine at City St George's, University of London. Health advice warns that women can run the risk of harming their baby if they don't take paracetamol to bring down a high temperature or relieve pain when pregnant. This can increase the risk of miscarriage, premature birth or developmental problems in babies. Medical experts not involved in the research have welcomed the study's findings, saying it will help reduce worry among women. Prof Grainne McAlonnan, from King's College London, said expectant mothers "do not need the stress of questioning whether medicine most commonly used for a headache could have far reaching effects on their child's health". "I hope the findings of this study bring the matter to a close," she said. Prof Ian Douglas, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the review was "well-conducted" because it excluded studies of lower quality, where no account was taken of important differences between mothers who use or don't use paracetamol during pregnancy, such as underlying illnesses. According to Prof Jan Haavik, molecular neuroscientist and clinical psychiatrist at the University of Bergen, the study provides "strong evidence" that use of paracetamol during pregnancy does not increase the risk of autism, ADHD or intellectual disability and "should effectively put this question to rest". It is widely believed by scientists working in this field that autism is the result of a complex mix of factors, including genetic and environmental ones. A spokesman from the US Department of Health and Human Services said "many experts" had expressed concern over the use of acetaminophen - the US name for paracetamol - during pregnancy. For example, a review in August 2025 led by Dr Andrew Baccarelli, dean of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, found that using acetaminophen during pregnancy may increase children's autism and ADHD risk, and urged caution over "especially heavy or prolonged use". Months earlier, Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr had pledged to find out the cause of a steep rise in reported autism cases. In a controversial speech in the Oval Office in September, the US president said doctors would be advised not to prescribe the pain reliever to pregnant women. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) then issued a letter to clinicians urging them to be cautious about the use of acetaminophen in pregnancy, while also saying it was still the only drug approved for treating fevers during pregnancy. On its website, the FDA says "a causal relationship" between the drug and neurological conditions "has not been established". Health officials in the UK have stressed that paracetamol remains the safest painkiller available to pregnant women.

**Excerpt**

Machado vows to lead Venezuela 'when right time comes' Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado has vowed she will lead the country "when the right time comes". "There's a mission, and we are going to turn Venezuela into that land of grace, and I believe I will be elected when the right time comes as president of Venezuela, the first woman president," she told Fox News. Her comments come a day after she gave President Donald Trump her Nobel Peace Prize medal, calling it a recognition of his commitment to Venezuela's freedom. The US seized Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro in Caracas on 3 January and removed him to New York to face various drugs and weapons charges. However, Trump has declined to endorse Machado as Venezuela's new leader, saying she did not have enough domestic support - despite her opposition movement claiming victory in 2024's widely contested elections. He has instead been dealing with the country's interim president Delcy Rodríguez, who had been Maduro's vice-president and who on Friday held a two-hour meeting with the director of the CIA "at President Trump's direction" aimed at building trust and communication between the two countries, according to a US official. "Director Ratcliffe discussed potential opportunities for economic collaboration and that Venezuela can no longer be a safe haven for America's adversaries," the US official said. Asked on Friday about his decision to work with Rodríguez over Machado, Trump told reporters his decision had been informed by the US experience in Iraq more than 20 years ago. Security and political structures were dismantled after the US invaded, setting the scene for insurgency and the eventual emergence of the Islamic State group. "If you ever remember a place called Iraq, where everybody was fired - every single person, the police, the generals, everybody was fired - and they ended up being ISIS... I remember that," he said. Speaking later at an event in Washington, Machado said she was confident there would be an "orderly transition" in her country. "The result of a stable transition will be a proud Venezuela that will be the best ally the US has ever had in the Americas," she said. "This has nothing to do with a tension between Delcy Rodríguez and myself, this is about a criminal structure - that is the regime - and the Venezuelan people," she added, describing herself as "just one member of a movement of millions of Venezuelans". Meanwhile, in Venezuela's capital Caracas, Rodríguez gave her first state of the union address since taking over as interim president. She said she was not afraid to face the US "diplomatically, through political dialogue". Rodríguez also said Venezuela needed to defend its "dignity and honour", and announced oil industry reforms to allow more foreign investment in a step away from Maduro's policies. Trump called Rodríguez a "terrific person" on Wednesday after the pair spoke on the phone, a conversation the Venezuelan leader called "productive and courteous". The following day, the US president called Machado a "wonderful woman who has been through so much", describing her gift of the Nobel Peace Prize medal as a "wonderful gesture of mutual respect".

**Excerpt**

CIA director had two-hour meeting with new Venezuelan leader in Caracas CIA director John Ratcliffe met Venezuela's Interim President Delcy Rodríguez in Caracas on Thursday "at President Trump's direction," a US official has said. The two-hour meeting was aimed at building trust and communication following the US seizure of Venezuela's former president Nicolás Maduro almost two weeks ago. Ratcliffe and Rodríguez discussed potential economic collaboration and that "Venezuela can no longer be a safe haven for America's adversaries", according to the US official. The meeting took place on the same day Rodríguez gave her first state of the union address since taking over as interim president, where she announced oil industry reforms to allow more foreign investment - a move away from Maduro's policies. During her speech to the nation, Rodríguez said she was not afraid to face the US "diplomatically through political dialogue," adding Venezuela had to defend its "dignity and honour". President Donald Trump has said US oil companies will move into Venezuela and make money that will go to people there and to the US, with a top official saying the US would control sales of sanctioned Venezuelan oil "indefinitely". Trump has asked oil companies to invest at least $100bn (£75bn) in Venezuela, but one executive said last week the country is currently "uninvestable". Rodríguez, the former vice-president, was sworn in on 5 January after US forces seized Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores in an operation in Caracas. They are now detained in New York, where they have pleaded not guilty to drug trafficking and other charges. The US official described the meeting between Rodríguez and Ratcliffe as "historic", adding that Ratcliffe was the first cabinet-level official to travel to Venezuela. The meeting also happened on the same day that Trump met opposition leader Maria Corina Machado in Washington, who presented the US president with her Nobel Peace Prize winning medal. In her state of the union address, Rodríguez told Venezuelans it was "very difficult" to deliver Maduro's annual report, saying that the two were working on the speech together until six hours before his seizure on 3 January. Noting the US is a nuclear power, the interim president said she was not afraid to engage in diplomacy, saying "we have to go together as Venezuelans to defend sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and also defend our dignity and our honour". She continued that if she needed to travel to Washington DC to meet with Trump, she would do so "walking on her feet, not dragged there". She added that "all of Venezuela is threatened", and called for national unity to "wage the diplomatic battle". In her address, Rodríguez announced the proposal to reform the country's hydrocarbon law, saying she had asked the legislative body to approve it. Until now, Venezuela's hydrocarbon law has stated foreign partners must work with the country's state-owned oil and gas company, PDVSA - which must hold a majority stake. The reforms, Rodríguez said, would allow investment to flow to new fields. She said she had instructed her government to create two sovereign funds - one for social protection so that "foreign currency goes directly to hospitals, schools, food, housing" and the second for infrastructure and social development to invest in water, electricity and roads. Venezuela has been facing an economic crisis, with a sharp rise in food prices and the lack of purchasing power. Before the US operation to seize Maduro, Venezuelans told the BBC they were concerned about what they were going to eat. "We're more worried about food. Venezuela is in bad shape. Inflation is eating us alive," one man said. Rodríguez's reforms come as Trump and American investors eye opportunity in Venezuela, which holds the world's largest proven oil reserves. Bosses of the biggest US oil firms who attended a meeting at the White House last week acknowledged that Venezuela represented an enticing opportunity. But they said significant changes would be needed to make the region an attractive investment. Trump said his administration would decide which firms would be allowed to operate. "You're dealing with us directly. You're not dealing with Venezuela at all. We don't want you to deal with Venezuela," he said. Trump also said that "one of the things the United States gets out of this will be even lower energy prices". Venezuela has had a complicated relationship with international oil firms since crude oil was discovered in its territory more than 100 years ago. Chevron is the last remaining major American oil company still operating in the country.

**Excerpt**

China and Canada announce tariffs relief after a high-stakes meeting between Carney and Xi Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Canadian PM Mark Carney have announced lower tariffs, signalling a reset in their countries' relationship after a key meeting in Beijing. China is expected to lower levies on Canadian canola oil from 85% to 15% by 1 March, while Ottawa has agreed to tax Chinese electric vehicles at the most-favoured-nation rate, 6.1%, Carney told reporters. The deal is a breakthrough after years of strained ties and tit-for-tat levies. Xi hailed the "turnaround" in their relationship but it is also a win for Carney, the first Canadian leader to visit China in nearly a decade. He has been trying to diversify Canadian trade away from the US, his country's biggest trading partner, following the uncertainty caused by Trump's on-again-off-again tariffs. The deal could also see more Chinese investments in Canada, right on America's doorstep. Carney himself seemed to allude to the fact that this was a result of Trump's tariffs, which have now pushed one of the US's key allies towards its biggest rival. He told reporters that Canada's relationship with China had been more "predictable" in recent months and that he found talks with Beijing "realistic and respectful". He also made clear Ottawa does not agree with Beijing on everything, adding that in his discussions with Xi he made clear Canada's "red lines", including human rights, concerns over election interference and the need for "guardrails". "We take the world as it is - not as we wish it to be," he said when asked about China's human rights record. Observers believe Carney's visit could set an example for other countries across the world who are also feeling the pain from Washington's tariffs. In contrast, Xi has been trying to show that China is a stable global partner and has been urging more pragmatic ties - in the words of Beijing, "a win-win" for all. And it seems to be working. The South Korean president and the Irish prime minister have both visited Beijing in recent weeks. The UK prime minister is expected to visit soon and so is the German Chancellor. Carney said the "world has changed dramatically" and how Canada positions itself "will shape our future for decades to come," he added. Earlier in his three-day visit, he had said that the Canada-China partnership sets the two countries up for a "new world order". He later added that the multilateral system had been "eroded, to use a polite term, or undercut". As the Chinese and Canadian delegations sat down in the Great Hall of the People on Friday, Xi said: "The healthy and stable development of China-Canada relations is conducive to world peace, stability, development, and prosperity." A trade reset Tariffs have been a key sticking point between the two sides. In 2024, Canada imposed 100% tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, following similar US curbs. Last year, Beijing retaliated with tariffs on more than $2bn (£1.5bn) of Canadian farm and food products like canola seed and oil. As a result Chinese imports of Canadian goods fell by 10% in 2025. In the deal struck on Friday, Canada will allow only 49,000 Chinese electric vehicles into the Canadian market at the 6.1% tariff rate. The cap is in response to Canadian automakers' fears of an influx of affordable Chinese EVs. As well as relief for canola producers, there will also be reduced tariffs on Canadian lobsters, crabs, and peas. China is Canada's second-largest trading partner but it's still a long way behind the US in volume. Economic ties with China are increasingly important for Carney. On arrival in Beijing on Wednesday, he met senior executives from prominent Chinese businesses, including an electric vehicle battery maker and an energy giant. On Thursday the two countries signed several agreements on energy and trade cooperation. The visit is a "reset of a relationship" that may be "modest in ambition" but "much more realistic about what we can reasonably obtain", said Colin Robertson, a former Canadian diplomat and vice-president at the Canadian Global Affairs Institute. A frosty history The last Canadian PM to visit China was Justin Trudeau, who met Xi in Beijing in 2017. That visit took place before the relationship soured in 2018, following Canada's arrest of Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer at the Chinese tech giant Huawai, at the request of the US. Days later, China detained Canadian citizens Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor on espionage charges - a move critics saw as retaliation for Meng's arrest, which China denied. Meng and both Michaels were released in 2021. Ahead of the Carney-Xi meeting, Michael Kovrig wrote on X that the visit should not just be about warming ties but also "managing leverage". Kovrig described Chinese negotiators as "extremely adroit, calculating, and always looking for leverage". "That's why engagement has to be handled with discipline," he wrote, adding that Carney should also advocate for Canadians imprisoned in China. There are about 100 of them, according to Canadian media. Speaking to reporters, Carney was clear that with countries that do not share the same values, Ottawa will engage on a "narrower, more specific" manner. "We're very clear about where we cooperate, where we differ," he said, adding that Chinese claims over self-governed Taiwan and Hong Kong's jailed pro-democracy figure Jimmy Lai came up in "broad discussions". Canada and China have "different systems", he said, which limits the breadth of their cooperation. "But to have an effective relationship, we have direct conversations. We don't grab a megaphone and have the conversations that way."

**Excerpt**

Under fire from the sea, families in Odesa try to escape Russian barrage From Mariia's 16th-floor flat, the calm waters of the Black Sea stretch out into the horizon beneath the fading twilight. "Up here you can see and hear when the drones come," she says, standing by a wall-length, floor-to-ceiling window. When they hit buildings and homes in the city of Odesa down below "we see all the fires too". Her daughter Eva, who is nine, has learned the shapes and sounds of the objects that zoom through the sky on a daily basis. She proudly shows off a list of social media channels she checks when the air raid alerts go off. "She knows whether what's coming is a risk or a threat, and that calms her down," her father Sergii says. There is scarcely a place in Ukraine that has not been targeted since Russia launched its full-scale invasion nearly four years ago. But in recent weeks Odesa – Ukraine's third largest city – has come under sustained attack. Through strikes on port and energy infrastructure, Russia is trying to cripple the region's economy and dent the population's morale. Moscow, however, does not just hit facilities. Its drones, mostly as big as a motorcycle, regularly crash into high-rise buildings like Masha's, exploding on impact and blowing glass and debris inward. The consequences are often deadly. "A few months ago Eva said she was afraid the drone would come too fast and we wouldn't have time to hide," Mariia says. "But I explained that if it came towards us, it would get louder and louder and then we'd know we have to run." Mariia, Sergii and Eva are originally from Kherson, a region 200km (125m) to the east of Odesa which is now in large part occupied by Russia. They left as soon as the invasion started in 2022 and mother and daughter briefly moved to Germany as refugees. But Sergii and Mariia could not bear the distance, so the family reunited in Ukraine and moved to Odesa. Now, as attacks on the region intensify, Sergii wonders whether the family should prepare to leave again. "War is only about economics, and Odesa for the Russians is about infrastructure, so they will do their best to conquer it," he says. Tucked in south-western Ukraine, Odesa was an economic powerhouse before the war. But now that Russia occupies the majority of Ukraine's coastline, the region has become even more vital. Its three ports are Ukraine's largest and include the country's only deep-water port. With land crossings disrupted, 90% of Ukraine exports last year were shipped by sea. But in wartime the region's importance is also its weakness. Last month, Vladimir Putin threatened to cut off Ukraine's access to the sea in retaliation for Ukrainian strikes on the "shadow fleet" tankers Russia uses to circumvent sanctions. That threat has translated into concrete impact. For two years, Russia's attempts to thwart Odesa's economy have been near-relentless - but the last few weeks have been particularly difficult. Aerial attacks on the ports have destroyed cargo and containers and damaged infrastructure; crew members on foreign merchant ships operating in the Gulf of Odesa have been injured or killed by drones; and 800 air-raid alerts in a year repeatedly halted port operations. The result last year was a 45% decrease in exports of agricultural products, vital to Odesa's economy. The day after a drone strike this week set a Panamanian-flagged ship alight and severely injured one of its crew members, regional government head Oleh Kiper said that shipowners entering Odesa ports "clearly understand that they are entering a war zone" and that the ships were insured. But if such attacks continue, in the long run foreign companies may be put off trading with the port. As the strikes surge, air sirens go off frequently, but not everyone heeds them. Standing in front of a destroyed gym the morning after an overnight drone strike that injured seven people, Maryna Averina of the State Emergency Service concedes people have become "very careless about their own safety". A recent air raid alert lasted for most of the day. "Sitting in a shelter for 16 hours is simply unrealistic," Averina says, as gym staff emerge from the destroyed building with whatever objects they have managed to salvage from the rubble and mangled metal inside. While many Ukrainians are now sadly accustomed to the drone and missile strikes, they are increasingly frayed by the relentless attacks that cut off electricity and heating in the middle of a particularly biting winter. In December, almost a million people in Odesa were left with no power. "We were among the first regions to experience what it means to go through the winter period without electricity and without heating," says Oleh Kiper. A month later, as temperatures hover around -1C, the supply remains severely disrupted. Ada, 36, is strolling on the beach, unfazed by the wail of air alert sirens mingling with the squawking of seagulls. The drone attacks have ramped up but, she says, "the shelling isn't as scary as this cold is". Nearby, a young mum named Yana agrees. Recently, she says, the situation across the board "has been really, really difficult". At one point, a drone crashed into her flat, and another one hit the block soon afterwards. Then came the power cuts. She and her family bought an expensive generator, but running it for seven hours costs around $10 - a significant expense in a country where the average monthly salary is around $500 (£375). "We've all been living like this for four years now, unfortunately. We're as helpless as flies, and everything is just being decided between the authorities," she says, while struggling to keep her shrieking toddler out of the icy water. "Maybe we're being punished for something – the whole nation, not just a few, but everyone." Further down the beach, Kostya is fishing on a jetty stretching out into the sea. He says he is not worried about the Russians advancing to the city. "I don't think they'll make it here. [The Ukrainians] will break their legs first." But, he adds, things are painful, and scary. And like many Ukrainians he still seems to struggle to accept that war came to his country four years ago, waged by a neighbour he once knew so well. In his youth, Kostya served in the army and swore an oath to the Soviet Union. "I never imagined that I would see something like this in my old age," he says. While Russian propagandists have long insisted that Ukraine's independence since 1991 is a historical mistake, Odesa's past role as the jewel in the crown of the Russian empire means it still holds particularly strong symbolic importance for Moscow. Vladimir Putin has repeatedly referred to Odesa as a "Russian city" and frequently invoked the notion of "liberating Novorossiya", a historical region of the Russian empire that encompassed parts of modern southern and eastern Ukraine, including Odesa. "They wanted and they still want to seize Odesa, just like many other regions, but today everything possible and impossible is being done by our military to prevent this from happening," insists the regional government leader. Oleh Kiper has made it a personal mission to sever any perceived remaining ties that Odesa has with Russia. He is a staunch supporter of a 2023 Law on Decolonisation, which directed local authorities to rid their cities of any street names, monuments or inscriptions that could be linked to Russia's imperial past. Among the statues to be removed was a monument to the founder of Odesa, Russian Empress Catherine the Great, while streets named after Russian and Soviet figures were renamed. Pushkin Street became Italian Street, and Catherine Street is now European Street. Kiper also champions the usage of Ukrainian in a city where Russian is still very widely spoken. Asked about the resistance he meets from Odesites who are proud of their heritage as a multicultural port to the world, he is defiant. "The enemy is doing far more than we are to ensure that a Russian-speaking city becomes Ukrainian," says Kiper. "It is forcing people to understand who the Russians are and whether we need them at all." The following day, as temperatures dropped to -6C, the city marked one month of partial blackouts, and air raid alerts were in force for four hours. The port of Chernomorsk, east of Odesa, was again hit by a ballistic missile, injuring a crew member on a civilian ship. As is the case with the rest of Ukraine, if Russia cannot have Odesa, it seems determined to continue crippling it. Additional reporting by Liubov Sholudko

From camouflage to tracksuits - Guinea's junta leader poised to become civilian president From the moment he seized power in September 2021 Guinea's Mamadi Doumbouya struck an imposing figure. Just 36 years old at the time, the broad-shouldered colonel, standing at well over six feet (1.8m), wearing military fatigues, mirrored sunglasses and a red beret certainly made an impression when announcing the coup. A relatively unknown member of an elite army unit, he declared that the government of ousted President Alpha Condé had disregarded democratic principles and that citizens' rights were being trampled on. After more than four years of acting as interim president, and going back on a promise not to run for leadership of the country, Doumbouya, now 41, is set to be sworn in as the elected head of state on Saturday. The discreet, disciplined and private man won 87% of the vote in December's election against a severely depleted field. Ex-Prime Minister Cellou Dalein Diallo, now in exile, described the process as a charade which generated "fabricated" results. While seemingly enjoying some popular support, critics have questioned Doumbouya's democratic credentials as some political parties have been banned, activists have mysteriously disappeared and media outlets been shut down. Scrolling back through the social media accounts from the president's office there is a sense of a carefully curated image. The army man, now a general, has, for the main, ditched the camouflage in favour of the baseball cap and tracksuit, or a boubou - traditional Guinean attire of loose-fitting robes with elaborate embroidery. The shades though are still at times in evidence. Pictures show him at the opening of schools, or transport and mining infrastructure or cycling through the streets of the capital, Conakry. The message is clear: this is a man of action who is working on behalf of the people. "This was presenting an image of someone who can be close to civilians, someone who is a civilian leader and can be representative of the people," Beverly Ochieng, senior analyst with Dakar-based security intelligence firm Control Risks, told the BBC. "In some ways this is distancing himself from what brought him to power – a coup - and the fact that his entire career has been in the military." In the 15 years before he took power, Doumbouya gained extensive international experience, including being educated to master's level in France and serving in the French Foreign Legion. He was also in Afghanistan, Ivory Coast, Djibouti, Central African Republic and worked on close protection in Israel, Cyprus and the UK. But the donning of civilian clothes may not be entirely sincere, according to some analysts. "I'm not sure I'm convinced that he has transitioned from a military man. I think that the military costume will remain even if he is conducting the return to civilian order," argued Aïssatou Kanté, a researcher in the West Africa office of the Institute of Security Studies. She referred to a ban on political demonstrations, the exclusion of Doumbouya's main challengers in December's election and the suspension of key opposition parties. Human rights campaigners have demanded to know the whereabouts of two activists - Oumar Sylla (known as Foniké Menguè) and Mamadou Billo Bah – who have not been seen since July 2024. They suspect the men were taken by the military. Press freedom organisation Reporters Without Borders has also expressed concern that journalist Habib Marouane Camara has been missing for more than a year. It has described how journalists are now censoring themselves and are fearful about what might happen to them. Nevertheless, the 2021 coup was widely welcomed in the country and since then Doumbouya appears to have remained a popular figure. Polling organisation Afrobarometer found that between 2022 and 2024 the proportion of people who trusted the president either "partially" or "a lot" grew from 46% to 53%. The president-elect may not have a clearly defined ideology guiding him but for Kanté his emphasis on Guineans being in control of their own destiny has become very important. "It's what keeps coming up in official speeches - this affirmation of political and economic sovereignty," she told the BBC. In his address to the nation a few days into the new year, he struck a conciliatory tone, calling on all Guineans to build a nation of peace and "fully assumed" sovereignty. In a country that continues to grapple with high levels of poverty despite plentiful natural resources – including the world's largest reserves of bauxite, which is used to make aluminium - this idea strikes a chord. The government's messaging on the development of the vast iron-ore resources in Simandou underscores the possible benefits for the people. The three billion tonnes of ore available in a remote southern part of the country, which began to be exported last month, could transform the global iron market, as well as Guinea's fortunes. The authorities say earnings from the project, partly owned by Chinese miners as well as the British-Australian corporation Rio Tinto, will be invested in new transport infrastructure as well as health and education. The success or otherwise of Simandou may define Doumbouya's presidency. He appears determined to keep some of the processing and added-value parts of the industry in Guinea to ensure greater benefits. Across the broader mining sector, his government has cancelled dozens of contracts over the past year where it was felt that the companies were not investing in Guinea – a move that has led one UAE-based firm to take the country to an international court. "This move towards resource nationalism makes him look like a local hero. He looks like he's really fighting for the rights of his citizens, even if that means business disruptions," said analyst Ochieng. The emphasis on sovereignty has also led to a pragmatic approach to international relations, observers say. Unlike coup leaders elsewhere in West Africa, Doumbouya has not outrightly rejected the former colonial power France in favour of Russia. Neither, despite his background in France and having a French wife, has he been accused of being a puppet of Paris. Doumbouya very much wants to be seen as someone running things in the interests of the country. Come Saturday, the president will preach a message of national unity and will hope that he can usher in a new era of prosperity for Guinea.

**Excerpt**

'Anger and frustration': BBC reports from Iranian-Armenian border For over two weeks, demonstrations rocked Iran and, according to a human rights group, more than 2,600 protesters have been killed. Protesters have been met with deadly force by authorities, masked by a near total shutdown of the internet and communication services. Reporting from the Iranian-Armenian border, the BBC's Middle East correspondent, Hugo Bachega, described the "anger and frustration" of Iranians and their concerns over the future. "People are simply terrified to join the demonstrations," he added. The Iranian government has called the protests "riots" backed by Iran's enemies. The demonstrations started over the economy on 28 December and turned into calls for the end of the rule of Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Hosseini Khamenei.
